AB Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-driven traits are commonly introduced into tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) in less than a year. Although CRISPR technology is highly suitable for rapid incorporation of new traits into plants with superior breeding backgrounds, the usefulness of these traits must be demonstrated prior to large-scale distribution of any new variety possessing them. The jointless pedicel trait is crucial for stem-free harvest of tomato fruits and is therefore an essential requirement for developing low-labor tomato varieties. We aimed to evaluate the effect of CRISPR-driven jointless pedicel trait on the yield and horticultural traits of fresh-market tomatoes. We conducted field trials during three consecutive seasons using three related genotypes of two elite fresh-market tomatoes, namely a jointed pedicel tomato, a CRISPR-driven jointless pedicel mutant of the jointed pedicel tomato, and a conventionally-bred jointless pedicel near isogenic line (NIL) to the jointed pedicel tomato. Field evaluations confirmed that the total and medium-, large-, or extra-large-size fruit yields of the CRISPR-driven mutants were not statistically different for those corresponding to their backgrounds and that the fruit yield stratified by fruit size might be varied under different growth conditions. We did not observe any negative correlation between the genotype and the fruit/abscission joint detachment force for any of the genotypes under study.

AB Objectives: To assess the accuracy of ChatGPT answers concerning orthodontic clear aligners. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional content analysis of ChatGPT generated responses to queries related to clear aligner treatment (CAT) was undertaken. A total of 111 questions were generated by three orthodontists based on a set of predefined domains and subdomains. The artificial intelligence (AI) -generated (ChatGPT) answers were extracted and their accuracy was determined independently by five orthodontists. The accuracy of answers was assessed using a prepiloted fourpoint scale scoring rubric. Descriptive statistics were performed. Results: The total mean accuracy score for the entire set was 2.6 +/- 1.1. It was noted that 58% of the AI -generated answers were scored as objectively true, 18% were selected facts, 9% were minimal facts, and 15% were false. False claims included the ability of CAT to reduce the need for orthognathic surgery (4.0 +/- 0.0), improve airway function (3.8 +/- 0.5), achieve root parallelism (3.6 +/- 0.5), alleviate sleep apnea (3.8 +/- 0.5), and produce more stable results compared to fixed appliances (3.8 +/- 0.5). Conclusions: The overall level of accuracy of ChatGPT responses to questions concerning CAT was suboptimal and lacked citations to relevant literature. Ability of the software to offer current and precise information was limited. Therefore, clinicians and patients must be mindful of false claims and relevant facts omitted in the answers generated by ChatGPT. (Angle Orthod. 2024;94:263-272.)

AB Our purpose was to develop a neural network-based registration quality evaluator (RQE) that can improve the 2D/3D image registration robustness for pediatric patient setup in external beam radiotherapy. Orthogonal daily setup X-ray images of six pediatric patients with brain tumors receiving proton therapy treatments were retrospectively registered with their treatment planning computed tomography (CT) images. A neural network-based pattern classifier was used to determine whether a registration solution was successful based on geometric features of the similarity measure values near the point-of-solution. Supervised training and test datasets were generated by rigidly registering a pair of orthogonal daily setup X-ray images to the treatment planning CT. The best solution for each registration task was selected from 50 optimizing attempts that differed only by the randomly generated initial transformation parameters. The distance from each individual solution to the best solution in the normalized parametrical space was compared to a user-defined error tolerance to determine whether that solution was acceptable. A supervised training was then used to train the RQE. Performance of the RQE was evaluated using test dataset consisting of registration results that were not used in training. The RQE was integrated with our in-house 2D/3D registration system and its performance was evaluated using the same patient dataset. With an optimized sampling step size (i. e., 5 mm) in the feature space, the RQE has the sensitivity and the specificity in the ranges of 0.865-0.964 and 0.797-0.990, respectively, when used to detect registration error with mean voxel displacement (MVD) greater than 1 mm. The trial-to-acceptance ratio of the integrated 2D/3D registration system, for all patients, is equal to 1.48. The final acceptance ratio is 92.4%. The proposed RQE can potentially be used in a 2D/3D rigid image registration system to improve the overall robustness by rejecting unsuccessful registration solutions. The RQE is not patient-specific, so a single RQE can be constructed and used for a particular application (e. g., the registration for images acquired on the same anatomical site). Implementation of the RQE in a 2D/3D registration system is clinically feasible.

AB Objectives To investigate individual, interpersonal, health system, and community factors associated with suicidal ideation (SI) and attempts (SA). Methods Utilizing nationally representative data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (7(th)-12(th) graders in 1994-95 followed >20 years until 2016-18, N=18,375), least absolute shrinkage selector operator (LASSO) regression determined multilevel predictors of SA and SI. Models comprised full and diagnosis subgroups (ADD/ADHD, depression, PTSD, anxiety, learning disabilities [LD]). Results Approximately 2.48% and 8.97% reported SA and SI, respectively. Over 25% had depression, and 20.98% anxiety, 6.42% PTSD, 4.55% ADD/ADHD, and 2.50% LD. LASSO regression identified 20 and 21 factors associated with SA and SI. Individual-level factors associated with SI and SA included educational attainment, substance use, ADD/ADHD, depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Interpersonal-level factors included social support, household size, and parental education, while health system-level factors comprised health care receipt, health insurance, and counseling. The strongest associations were among individual-level factors followed by interpersonal and health system factors. Conclusions The distinct factors associated with SI and SA across diagnostic subgroups highlight the importance of targeted, subgroup-specific suicide prevention interventions. These findings emphasize the value of precise, data-driven approaches for suicide prevention among diverse populations and individuals with disabilities across the life-course.

TI Rethinking Environmental Disclosure
SO CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID INFORMATION; POLLUTION
AB Twenty years ago, legal scholars and regulators alike were convinced that information-forcing regulations heralded a new era in environmental law. Coming off the success of the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), which seemed to decrease toxic chemical pollution solely by forcing industry to disclose if they released certain chemicals, many called information regulation the third wave of environmental law. New information disclosure policies were enacted and old policies reinvigorated, leading to a plethora of informationbased regulations throughout environmental law. Now, twenty years later, the emergence of big data and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to environmental analysis have only further increased the belief in the benefits of information-forcing approaches. In this time, the central premise that information regulation works to change behavior and improve environmental outcomes has been largely unquestioned. Despite the widespread enthusiasm, after decades of implementation it is increasingly clear that information regulation largely fails to achieve its environmental goals. This Article makes two main contributions. By drawing on quantitative and qualitative case studies of information-forcing regulations, it first answers the question of whether this approach to environmental regulation is effective. It evaluates the success of information-forcing policies, finding that these policies often fail both to change behavior towards improving environmental conditions and to achieve other stated goals. This Article then analyzes the mechanisms behind information forcing in conjunction with these case studies to propose characteristics that determine the success, or failure, of information regulation. It finds that contrary to popular belief, persuasive and economic mechanisms not drive environmental behavior change. Instead, information- forcing regulations with legal mechanisms of action show the most promise and efficacy. Moving beyond sweeping promises of efficiency and transparency to understand the specific characteristics that make these programs successful is essential moving forward into an era of big environmental data.

TI Generalizability of Machine Learning Models: Quantitative Evaluation of
   Three Methodological Pitfalls
SO RADIOLOGY-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

DT Article
ID RADIOMICS; TOOL
AB Purpose: To investigate the impact of the following three methodological pitfalls on model generalizability: (a) violation of the independence assumption, (b) model evaluation with an inappropriate performance indicator or baseline for comparison, and (c) batch effect. Materials and Methods: The authors used retrospective CT, histopathologic analysis, and radiography datasets to develop machine learning models with and without the three methodological pitfalls to quantitatively illustrate their effect on model performance and generalizability. F1 score was used to measure performance, and differences in performance between models developed with and without errors were assessed using the Wilcoxon rank sum test when applicable. Results: Violation of the independence assumption by applying oversampling, feature selection, and data augmentation before splitting data into training, validation, and test sets seemingly improved model F1 scores by 71.2% for predicting local recurrence and 5.0% for predicting 3-year overall survival in head and neck cancer and by 46.0% for distinguishing histopathologic patterns in lung cancer. Randomly distributing data points for a patient across datasets superficially improved the F1 score by 21.8%. High model performance metrics did not indicate high-quality lung segmentation. In the presence of a batch effect, a model built for pneumonia detection had an F1 score of 98.7% but correctly classified only 3.86% of samples from a new dataset of healthy patients. Conclusion: Machine learning models developed with these methodological pitfalls, which are undetectable during internal evaluation, produce inaccurate predictions; thus, understanding and avoiding these pitfalls is necessary for developing generalizable models.

AB Through a community-driven competition, the PANDA challenge provides a curated diverse dataset and a catalog of models for prostate cancer pathology, and represents a blueprint for evaluating AI algorithms in digital pathology.
   Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promise for diagnosing prostate cancer in biopsies. However, results have been limited to individual studies, lacking validation in multinational settings. Competitions have been shown to be accelerators for medical imaging innovations, but their impact is hindered by lack of reproducibility and independent validation. With this in mind, we organized the PANDA challenge-the largest histopathology competition to date, joined by 1,290 developers-to catalyze development of reproducible AI algorithms for Gleason grading using 10,616 digitized prostate biopsies. We validated that a diverse set of submitted algorithms reached pathologist-level performance on independent cross-continental cohorts, fully blinded to the algorithm developers. On United States and European external validation sets, the algorithms achieved agreements of 0.862 (quadratically weighted kappa, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.840-0.884) and 0.868 (95% CI, 0.835-0.900) with expert uropathologists. Successful generalization across different patient populations, laboratories and reference standards, achieved by a variety of algorithmic approaches, warrants evaluating AI-based Gleason grading in prospective clinical trials.

   network; nonlinear systems; RISE feedback; robust control
AB The use of a neural network (NN) as a feedforward control element to compensate for nonlinear system uncertainties has been investigated for over a decade. Typical NN-based controllers yield uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) stability results due to residual functional reconstruction inaccuracies and an inability to compensate for some system disturbances. Several researchers have proposed discontinuous feedback controllers (e.g., variable structure or sliding mode controllers) to reject the residual errors and yield asymptotic results. The research in this paper describes how a recently developed continuous robust integral of the sign of the error (RISE) feedback term can be incorporated with a NN-based feedforward term to achieve semi-global asymptotic tracking. To achieve this result, the typical stability analysis for the RISE method is modified to enable the incorporation of the NN-based feedforward terms, and a projection algorithm is developed to guarantee bounded NN weight estimates.

AB This paper develops a framework for privatizing the spectrum of the Laplacian of an undirected graph using differential privacy. We consider two privacy formulations. The first obfuscates the presence of edges in the graph and the second obfuscates the presence of nodes. We compare these two privacy formulations and show that the privacy formulation that considers edges is better suited to most engineering applications. We use the bounded Laplace mechanism to provide (epsilon, delta)-differential privacy to the eigenvalues of a graph Laplacian, and we pay special attention to the algebraic connectivity, which is the Laplacian's the second smallest eigenvalue. Analytical bounds are presented on the accuracy of the mechanisms and on certain graph properties computed with private spectra. A suite of numerical examples confirms the accuracy of private spectra in practice.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB In data analysis, when attempting to solve classification problems, we may encounter a large number of features. However, not all features are relevant for the current classification, and including irrelevant features can occasionally degrade learning performance. As a result, selecting the most relevant features is critical, especially for high-dimensional data sets in classification problems. Feature selection is an effective method for resolving this issue. It attempts to represent the original data by extracting relevant features containing useful information. In this research, our aim is to propose a p-norm least-squares Universum twin bounded support vector machine (LSp-UTBSVM) to perform classification and feature selection at the same time. Indeed, the proposed method, which outperforms the traditional least-squares Universum twin bounded support vector machine, can achieve good classification accuracy in a reasonable amount of time while also providing a sparse solution. The model we propose is an adaptive learning procedure with p-norm (0 < p < 1), where the parameter p can be automatically selected by the data set. The algorithm we use to find the approximate solution of this model involves solving systems of linear equations. Furthermore, we obtain new bounds for the absolute values of non-zero components of a local optimal solution. These bounds allow us to remove the zero components from an arbitrary numerical solution. Setting the parameter p, LSp-UTBSVM improves classification accuracy and selects the relevant features. Numerical experiments on a handwritten digit recognition, University of California Irvine (UCI) benchmark, Normally Distributed Clusters (NDC) and high dimensional data sets confirm the superiority of the proposed method in the accuracy of classification and the selection of relevant features in comparison with some popular methods.

AB Real time, accurate and reliable estimation of maize yield is valuable to policy makers in decision making. The current study was planned for yield estimation of spring maize using remote sensing and crop modeling. In crop modeling, the CERES-Maize model was calibrated and evaluated with the field experiment data and after calibration and evaluation, this model was used to forecast maize yield. A Field survey of 64 farm was also conducted in Faisalabad to collect data on initial field conditions and crop management data. These data were used to forecast maize yield using crop model at farmers' field. While in remote sensing, peak season Landsat 8 images were classified for landcover classification using machine learning algorithm. After classification, time series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) of the surveyed 64 farms were calculated. Principle component analysis were run to correlate the indicators with maize yield. The selected LSTs and NDVIs were used to develop yield forecasting equations using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Calibrated and evaluated results of CERES-Maize showed the mean absolute % error (MAPE) of 0.35-6.71% for all recorded variables. In remote sensing all machine learning algorithms showed the accuracy greater the 90%, however support vector machine (SVM-radial basis) showed the higher accuracy of 97%, that was used for classification of maize area. The accuracy of area estimated through SVM-radial basis was 91%, when validated with crop reporting service. Yield forecasting results of crop model were precise with RMSE of 255 kg ha(-1), while remote sensing showed the RMSE of 397 kg ha(-1). Overall strength of relationship between estimated and actual grain yields were good with R-2 of 0.94 in both techniques. For regional yield forecasting remote sensing could be used due greater advantages of less input dataset and if focus is to assess specific stress, and interaction of plant genetics to soil and environmental conditions than crop model is very useful tool.

AB The joint estimation of multiple graphical models from high-dimensional data has been studied in the statistics and machine learning literature, owing to its importance in diverse fields including molecular biology, neuroscience, and the social sciences. We propose a Bayesian approach that decomposes the model parameters across multiple graphical models into shared components across subsets of models and edges, and idiosyncratic components. This approach leverages a novel multivariate prior distribution, coupled with a jointly convex regression-based pseudo-likelihood that enables fast computation using a robust and efficient Gibbs sampling scheme. We establish strong posterior consistency for model selection under high-dimensional scaling, with the number of variables growing exponentially as a function of the sample size. Lastly, we demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach in borrowing strength across models to identify shared edges using both synthetic and real data.

AB Virtual and mixed-reality (XR) technology has advanced significantly in the last few years and will enable the future of work, education, socialization, and entertainment. Eye-tracking data is required for supporting novel modes of interaction, animating virtual avatars, and implementing rendering or streaming optimizations. While eye tracking enables many beneficial applications in XR, it also introduces a risk to privacy by enabling re-identification of users. We applied privacy definitions of k-anonymity and plausible deniability (PD) to datasets of eye-tracking samples and evaluated them against the state-of-the-art differential privacy (DP) approach. Two VR datasets were processed to reduce identification rates while minimizing the impact on the performance of trained machine-learning models. Our results suggest that both PD and DP mechanisms produced practical privacy-utility trade-offs with respect to re-identification and activity classification accuracy, while k-anonymity performed best at retaining utility for gaze prediction.

AB In this paper, we conduct a statistical and temporal analysis to analyze dynamic factors for the temporal heterogeneity, complexity, similarity, and discrepancy on a novel location aware multivariate time series dataset. The dataset represents the temperature variations across 6 different shipments with 9 sensors in each shipment monitoring and recording sensory data at 15- min intervals across multiple days. Each container had three instrumented pallets where each pallet had a temperature sensor placed near the top, middle and the bottom of the pallet for a total of nine sensors in each shipment. The goal of this paper is to primarily introduce the dataset, make it available to other researchers, provide its descriptive statistics with some time series visualization, and time-series statistical and temporal analysis. Finally, Potential use cases of machine learning and data analytics are discussed for a few application domains.

AB Overly restrictive eligibility criteria for clinical trials may limit the generalizability of the trial results to their target real-world patient populations. We developed a novel machine learning approach using large collections of real-world data (RWD) to better inform clinical trial eligibility criteria design. We extracted patients' clinical events from electronic health records (EHRs), which include demographics, diagnoses, and drugs, and assumed certain compositions of these clinical events within an individual's EHRs can determine the subphenotypes-homogeneous clusters of patients, where patients within each subgroup share similar clinical characteristics. We introduced an outcome-guided probabilistic model to identify those subphenotypes, such that the patients within the same subgroup not only share similar clinical characteristics but also at similar risk levels of encountering severe adverse events (SAEs). We evaluated our algorithm on two previously conducted clinical trials with EHRs from the OneFlorida+ Clinical Research Consortium. Our model can clearly identify the patient subgroups who are more likely to suffer or not suffer from SAEs as subphenotypes in a transparent and interpretable way. Our approach identified a set of clinical topics and derived novel patient representations based on them. Each clinical topic represents a certain clinical event composition pattern learned from the patient EHRs. Tested on both trials, patient subgroup (#SAE=0) and patient subgroup (#SAE>0) can be well-separated by k-means clustering using the inferred topics. The inferred topics characterized as likely to align with the patient subgroup (#SAE>0) revealed meaningful combinations of clinical features and can provide data-driven recommendations for refining the exclusion criteria of clinical trials. The proposed supervised topic modeling approach can infer the clinical topics from the subphenotypes with or without SAEs. The potential rules for describing the patient subgroups with SAEs can be further derived to inform the design of clinical trial eligibility criteria.

DE RNA Folding; Nussinov's algorithm; Cache efficient
ID SECONDARY STRUCTURE
AB Background: An RNA folding/RNA secondary structure prediction algorithm determines the non-nested/pseudoknot-free structure by maximizing the number of complementary base pairs and minimizing the energy. Several implementations of Nussinov's classical RNA folding algorithm have been proposed. Our focus is to obtain run time and energy efficiency by reducing the number of cache misses.
   Results: Three cache-efficient algorithms, ByRow, ByRowSegment and ByBox, for Nussinov's RNA folding are developed. Using a simple LRU cache model, we show that the Classical algorithm of Nussinov has the highest number of cache misses followed by the algorithms Transpose (Li et al.), ByRow, ByRowSegment, and ByBox (in this order). Extensive experiments conducted on four computational platforms-Xeon E5, AMD Athlon 64 X2, Intel I7 and PowerPC A2-using two programming languages-C and Java-show that our cache efficient algorithms are also efficient in terms of run time and energy.
   Conclusion: Our benchmarking shows that, depending on the computational platform and programming language, either ByRow or ByBox give best run time and energy performance. The C version of these algorithms reduce run time by as much as 97.2% and energy consumption by as much as 88.8% relative to Classical and by as much as 56.3% and 57.8% relative to Transpose. The Java versions reduce run time by as much as 98.3% relative to Classical and by as much as 75.2% relative to Transpose. Transpose achieves run time and energy efficiency at the expense of memory as it takes twice the memory required by Classical. The memory required by ByRow, ByRowSegment, and ByBox is the same as that of Classical. As a result, using the same amount of memory, the algorithms proposed by us can solve problems up to 40% larger than those solvable by Transpose.

DE entropy; estimation; minimum error entropy estimation
ID INFORMATION-THEORETIC APPROACH; DYNAMIC-STOCHASTIC SYSTEMS; ALGORITHM
AB The minimum error entropy (MEE) criterion has been receiving increasing attention due to its promising perspectives for applications in signal processing and machine learning. In the context of Bayesian estimation, the MEE criterion is concerned with the estimation of a certain random variable based on another random variable, so that the error's entropy is minimized. Several theoretical results on this topic have been reported. In this work, we present some further results on the MEE estimation. The contributions are twofold: (1) we extend a recent result on the minimum entropy of a mixture of unimodal and symmetric distributions to a more general case, and prove that if the conditional distributions are generalized uniformly dominated (GUD), the dominant alignment will be the MEE estimator; (2) we show by examples that the MEE estimator (not limited to singular cases) may be non-unique even if the error distribution is restricted to zero-mean (unbiased).

AB Cocaine dependence constitutes a significant public health concern. This randomized, double-blind. placebo-controlled trial tested a novel approach to reducing cocaine use among cocaine-dependent individuals with D-cycloserine, a drug known to enhance learning and some learning-based therapies. Urine samples and cocaine craving were assessed across three phases: induction (Weeks 1-2), treatment (Weeks 3-5; urinalysis-based contingency management plus exposure therapy), and posttreatment (Weeks 6-7). During the treatment phase, either 50 mg of D-cycloserine or placebo was administered after delivery of urinalysis feedback with potential monetary reward and before exposure therapy sessions in naturalistic contexts individually associated with cocaine use. D-cycloserine significantly improved learning on an operant laboratory task. Contingency management significantly reduced cocaine use and craving. D-cycloserine did not significantly affect cocaine use or craving in the treatment phase. Craving significantly increased for the D-cycloserine group during the post treatment phase. Therefore, although the study showed that D-cycloserine was capable of improving learning. enhancement of learning-based therapy was not observed. Moreover, no differences in behavioral measures of cocaine demand (cocaine purchasing task) or monetary or sexual delay discounting were observed across phases or between groups in any phase. These results are somewhat consistent with previous findings suggesting that D-cycloserine administration increases cocaine craving, although they differ from other findings showing that D-cycloserine administration reduces alcohol or nicotine cravings. Methodological variables (e.g.. guided vs. unguided exposure therapy sessions, length of extinction exposure) likely play a role in dissimilar findings observed across studies.

AB Staff assignment is the decision-making to determine appropriate workforce with required skills to perform a specific task. Staff assignment is critical to success of construction projects, especially when responding to routine requests such as the change order and building service. However, the effectiveness is low due to manual processing by the management personnel. To improve the productivity of staff assignment, this paper creates a machine learning model that reads service request texts and automatically assigns workforce and priority through the technique of natural language processing (NLP). The dataset used for modeling in this study contains 82,106 building maintenance records for a 3-year period from over 60 buildings on a university campus. The results show a 77% accuracy for predicting workforce and an 88% accuracy for predicting priority, indicating a considerably high performance for multiclass and binary classifications. Different from existing studies, the NLP model highlights the value of stop-words and punctuation in learning service request texts. The NLP model presented in this study provides a solution for staff assignment and offers a piece of the puzzle to the information system automation in the construction industry. This study has an immediate implication for building maintenance; and, in the long term, contributes to human-building interactions in smart buildings by connecting human feedback to building control systems.

AB The complexity of hardware designs has increased over the years due to the rapid advancement of technology coupled with the need to support diverse and complex features. The increasing design complexity directly translates to difficulty in verifying functional behaviors as well as non-functional requirements. Simulation is the most widely used form of validation using both random and constrained-random test patterns. The random nature of test sequences can cover a vast majority of scenarios, however, it can introduce unacceptable overhead to cover all possible functional and non-functional scenarios. Directed tests are promising to cover the remaining corner cases and hard-to-detect scenarios. Manual development of directed tests can be time-consuming and error-prone. A promising avenue is to perform automated generation of directed tests. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of directed test generation techniques for hardware validation. Specifically, we first introduce the complexity of hardware verification to highlight the need for directed test generation. Next, we describe directed test generation using various automated techniques, including formal methods, concolic testing, and machine learning. Finally, we discuss how to effectively utilize the generated test patterns in different validation scenarios, including pre-silicon functional validation, post-silicon debug, as well as validation of non-functional requirements.

AB High impedance faults present unique challenges for power system protection engineers. The first challenge is the detection of the fault, given the low current magnitudes. The second challenge is to locate the fault to allow corrective measures to be taken. Corrective actions are essential as they mitigate safety hazards and equipment damage. The problem of high impedance fault detection and location is not a new one, and despite the safety and reliability implications, relatively few efforts have been made to find a general solution. This work presents a hybrid data driven and analytical-based model for high impedance fault detection in distribution systems. The first step is to estimate a state space model of the power line being monitored. From the state space model, eigenvalues are calculated, and their dynamic behavior is used to develop zones of protection. These zones of protection are generated analytically using machine learning tools. High impedance faults are detected as they drive the eigenvalues outside of their zones. A metric called eigenvalue drift coefficient was formulated in this work to facilitate the generalization of this solution. The performance of this technique is evaluated through case studies based on the IEEE 5-Bus system modeled in Matlab. Test results are encouraging indicating potential for real-life applications.

AB Low-dimensional nanomaterials provide promising material platforms for aggressively scaled transistor technologies. We assess the performance potential of transistors based on an array of Tellurium nanowires (TNWs), by parameterizing a machine-learning (ML) tight-binding model with quantum transport device simulations. It has been shown that a transistor based on a parallel array of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can have excellent on-state performance, but the small bandgap limits the transistor scalability and off-state performance. Our results indicate that compared to the CNT array FETs, the TNW array FETs have significantly suppressed ambipolar transport and improved subthreshold characteristics. The TNW array FET has the potential to achieve a near-ideal subthreshold swing (SS) close to 60 mV/dec, a very large on-off ratio (>10(9)), and low source-drain leakage current at a 10 nm-scale channel length, due to its excellent gate electrostatics with a gate-all-around (GAA) structure, larger band gap and reduced quantum-mechanical tunneling. The TNW array FET also shows excellent scalability with a SS below 100 mV/dec when the channel length is further scaled down to 5 nm. Its larger bandgap and heavier effective mass significantly reduce quantum tunneling. This mechanism contributes to improved subthreshold and lower leakage but also highlights the need to develop low Schottky barrier contacts for TNWs.

AB Predicting the progression of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) has been held back for decades due to the lack of sufficient longitudinal data required for the development of novel machine learning algorithms. This study proposes a novel machine learning algorithm for predicting the progression of Alzheimer's disease using a distributed multimodal, multitask learning method. More specifically, each individual task is defined as a regression model, which predicts cognitive scores at a single time point. Since the prediction tasks for multiple intervals are related to each other in chronological order, multitask regression models have been developed to track the relationship between subsequent tasks. Furthermore, since subjects have various combinations of recording modalities together with other genetic, neuropsychological and demographic risk factors, special attention is given to the fact that each modality may experience a specific sparsity pattern. The model is hence generalized by exploiting multiple individual multitask regression coefficient matrices for each modality. The outcome for each independent modality-specific learner is then integrated with complementary information, known as risk factor parameters, revealing the most prevalent trends of the multimodal data. This new feature space is then used as input to the gradient boosting kernel in search for a more accurate prediction. This proposed model not only captures the complex relationships between the different feature representations, but it also ignores any unrelated information which might skew the regression coefficients. Comparative assessments are made between the performance of the proposed method with several other well-established methods using different multimodal platforms. The results indicate that by capturing the interrelatedness between the different modalities and extracting only relevant information in the data, even in an incomplete longitudinal dataset, will yield minimized prediction errors.

AB Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurogenerative condition characterized by sharp cognitive decline with no confirmed effective treatment or cure. This makes it critically important to identify the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease in its early stages before significant cognitive deterioration has taken hold and even before any brain morphology and neuropathology are noticeable. In this study, five different multimodal deep neural networks (MDNN), with different architectures, in search of an optimal model for predicting the cognitive test scores for the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the modified Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-CoG13) over a span of 60 months (5 years). The multimodal data utilized to train and test the proposed models were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study and includes cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of tau and beta-amyloid, structural measures from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional and metabolic measures from positron emission tomography (PET), and cognitive scores from the neuropsychological tests (Cog). The models developed herein delve into two main issues: (1) application merits of single-task vs. multitask for predicting future cognitive scores and (2) whether time-varying input data are better suited than specific timepoints for optimizing prediction results. This model yields a high of 90.27% (SD = 1.36) prediction accuracy (correlation) at 6 months after the initial visit to a lower 79.91% (SD = 8.84) prediction accuracy at 60 months. The analysis provided is comprehensive as it determines the predictions at all other timepoints and all MDNN models include converters in the CN and MCI groups (CNc, MCIc) and all the unstable groups in the CN and MCI groups (CNun and MCIun) that reverted to CN from MCI and to MCI from AD, so as not to bias the results. The results show that the best performance is achieved by a multimodal combined single-task long short-term memory (LSTM) regressor with an input sequence length of 2 data points (2 visits, 6 months apart) augmented with a pretrained Neural Network Estimator to fill in for the missing values.

AB In order to evaluate the quality of Internet of Things (IoT) environments in smart houses, large datasets containing interactions between people and ubiquitous environments are essential for hardware and software testing. Both testing and simulation require a substantial amount of time and volunteer resources. Consequently, the ability to simulate these ubiquitous environments has recently increased in importance. In order to create an easy-to-use simulator for designing ubiquitous environments, we propose a simulator and autonomous agent generator that simulates human activity in smart houses. The simulator provides a three-dimensional (3D) graphical user interface (GUI) that enables spatial configuration, along with virtual sensors that simulate actual sensors. In addition, the simulator provides an artificial intelligence agent that automatically interacts with virtual smart houses using a motivation-driven behavior planning method. The virtual sensors are designed to detect the states of the smart house and its living agents.

TI Neural network prediction of severe lower intestinal bleeding and the

ID LOWER-GASTROINTESTINAL HEMORRHAGE; VALIDATION; OUTCOMES
AB Background: The prognosis for patients with severe acute lower intestinal bleeding (ALIB) may be assessed by complex artificial neural networks (ANNs) or user-friendly regression-based models. Comparisons between these modalities are limited, and predicting the need for surgical intervention remains elusive. We hypothesized that ANNs would outperform the Strate rule to predict severe bleeding and would also predict the need for surgical intervention.
   Methods: We performed a 4-y retrospective analysis of 147 adult patients who underwent endoscopy, angiography, or surgery for ALIB. Baseline characteristics, Strate risk factors, management parameters, and outcomes were analyzed. The primary outcomes were severe bleeding and surgical intervention. ANNs were created in SPSS. Models were compared by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) with 95% confidence intervals.
   Results: The number of Strate risk factors for each patient correlated significantly with the outcome of severe bleeding (r = 0.29, P < 0.001). However, the Strate model was less accurate than an ANN (AUROC 0.66 [0.57-0.75] versus 0.98 [0.95-1.00], respectively) which incorporated six variables present on admission: hemoglobin, systolic blood pressure, outpatient prescription for Aspirin 325 mg daily, Charlson comorbidity index, base deficit >= 5 mEq/L, and international normalized ratio >= 1.5. A similar ANN including hemoglobin nadir and the occurrence of a 20% decrease in hematocrit was effective in predicting the need for surgery (AUROC 0.95 [0.90-1.00]).
   Conclusions: The Strate prediction rule effectively stratified risk for severe ALIB, but was less accurate than an ANN. A separate ANN accurately predicted the need for surgery by combining risk factors for severe bleeding with parameters quantifying blood loss. Optimal prognostication may be achieved by integrating pragmatic regression-based calculators for quick decisions at the bedside and highly accurate ANNs when time and resources permit.

AB The neural retinas of all vertebrates have certain common cellular and structural features.  I have used immunochemical methods to investigate the biochemical constancy of specific types of retina cells.  Elasmobranchs such as the skate, ray, and shark exhibit retinal characteristics which are shared by all vertebrates as well as characteristics which seem to be limited to the more primitive retinas of fish.  The Muller glial cells of all vertebrates possess high concentrations of the enzyme glutamine synthetase.  Antibodies directed against chick glutamine synthetase specifically label Muller cells in all elasmobranch retinas examined thus far.  Antibodies to carbonic anhydrase also label Muller cells but to varying degrees of intensity depending on species and, surprisingly, the location within the retina(i.e., peripheral vs. central). Antibodies to carbonic anhydrase also label the horizontal neurons of elasmobranch retina.  In some examples, carbonic anhydrase labelling of horizontal cells is intense enough to allow visualization of the overall pattern of horizontal cell networking in wholemount preparations.  A monoclonal antibody to carbonic anhydrase shows horizontal cell densities and distribution which may be predictive of the retinal areas of highest visual acuity.  Horizontal cell compartmentalization of caronic anhydrase is not seen in terrestrial vertebrates such as birds and mammals suggesting a unique and perhaps primitive character for these cells in the elasmobranch retina. Other immunochemical markers have also been explored such as specific carbohydrate moieties found on mammalian neural adhesion molecules.  Again elasmobranch horizontal cells show unique labelling patterns with such antibodies as HNK-1.  Results show the potential utility of immunochemical markers developed for terrestrial vertebrate retina systems in the analyses of the cell biology of elasmobranch retina.  Furthermore, these findings underscore certain fundamental characteristics of the vertebrate retina which have remained constant for vast evolutionary periods.

AB Background and objective: Neural network based image reconstruction methods are becoming increasingly popular. However, limited training data and the lack of theoretical guarantees for generalizability raised concerns, especially in biomedical imaging applications. These challenges are known to lead to an unstable reconstruction process that poses significant problems in biomedical image reconstruction. In this paper, we present a new framework that uses untrained generator networks to tackle this challenge, leveraging the structure of deep networks for regularizing solutions based on a technique known as Deep Image Prior (DIP).
   Methods: To achieve a high reconstruction accuracy, we propose a framework optimizing both the latent vector and the weights of a generator network during the reconstruction process. We also propose the corresponding reconstruction strategies to improve the stability and convergent performance of the proposed framework. Furthermore, instead of calculating forward projection in each iteration, we propose implementing its normal operator as a convolutional kernel under parallel beam geometry, thus greatly accelerating the calculation.
   Results: Our experiments show that the proposed framework has significant improvements over other state-of-the-art conventional, pre-trained, and untrained methods under sparse-view, limited-angle, and low-dose conditions.
   Conclusions: Applying to parallel beam X-ray imaging, our framework shows advantages in speed, accuracy, and stability of the reconstruction process. We also show that the proposed framework is compatible with all differentiable regularizations that are commonly used in biomedical image reconstruction literature. Our framework can also be used as a post-processing technique to further improve the reconstruction generated by any other reconstruction methods. Furthermore, the proposed framework requires no training data and can be adjusted on-demand to adapt to different conditions (e.g. noise level, geometry, and imaged object). (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB The objective of this research was to investigate the efficacy of 10 NDES, including 3 NDES with new formula, to extract procyanidins and anthocyanins from cranberry pomace with the assistance of ultrasounds. The highest amount of procyanidins (32.5 mg/g) was extracted by a tailor designed NDES 2 consisting of choline chloride: betaine hydrochloride: levulinic acid (1:1:2) and 32 mL water/100 mL NDES. This yield was 3.26-fold of that by 75% ethanol. NDES 8 consisting of glucose: lactic acid (1:5) and 20 mL/100 mL water had the highest extraction yield of anthocyanins at 1.58 mg/g, which was 1.79-fold of the yield by 75% ethanol. The response surface methodology model for extraction of procyanidins by NDES 2 under different conditions had R-2 = 0.977, which was comparable to artificial neural networking (R-2 = 0.973). The ANN models for extraction of anthocyanins using NDES 8 under various conditions performed better than RSM model (R-2 = 0.95 for ANN versus 0.88 for RSM). Highest extraction yields predicted by ANN and RSM were close to the experimental yields, suggesting artificial neural networking was an alternative or better approach than RSM for predictive modeling.

AB The use of ensemble learning (EL) has grown due to its ability to enhance precision in predictions compared to typical machine learning (ML) algorithms. EL-based approaches are expected to be more accurate and efficient in simulating green engineering materials like sustainable concretes. In this study, three novel EL methods predict the compressive strength (CS) of concrete containing rice husk ash (CCRHA) using hybridizations of adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), gradient boosting regression trees (GBRT), random forests (RF), and teaching-learning-based optimisation algorithms (TLBO). Data for the CS of CCRHA (1212 instances) were collected from 42 published journal papers. Input variables included the amount of water, cement, fine aggregate, coarse aggregate, rice husk ash, superplasticizer, and curing time. Generally, GBRT-TLBO outperformed other approaches in testing with R2, RMSE, and MAE values of 0.976, 3.299, and 2.419 MPa, respectively. GBRT-TLBO models had superior capabilities in the testing phase with interquartile ranges of absolute error boxes equal to 1.0 MPa. A comparison with literature models showed that GBRT-TLBO was correctly tuned. Sensitivity analysis indicated cement and age as the most significant variables, while RHA was the least significant. Surface plots from parametric studies identified the interaction of input variables with concrete CS.
   Using ensemble learning (EL), the compressive strength (CS) of concrete composed of rice husk ash (CCRHA) is modelled.Three novel hybrid ensemble learning methods including AdaBoost, GBRT, RF, and teaching-learning-based optimisation algorithm (TLBO) are employed.The contents of water, cement, fine aggregate, coarse aggregate, rice husk ash, superplasticizer, and curing age were considered as inputs.Sensitivity analysis and parametric studies were performed to evaluate model feature importance and efficiency. For the same number of data records, the proposed models are superior to those developed via the research literature.

AB This study investigates whether social-versus task-oriented interaction of virtual shopping assistants differentially benefits low versus high Internet competency older consumers with respect to social (perceived interactivity, trust), cognitive (perceived information load), functional (self-efficacy, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness), and behavioral intent (website patronage intent) outcomes in an online shopping task. A total of 121 older adults (61-89 years) participated in a laboratory experiment with a 2 (digital assistant interaction style: (social-vs. task-oriented) x 2 (user Internet competency: low vs. high) x 2 (user exchange modality: text vs. voice) between-subjects design. The results revealed that users Internet competency and the digital assistant's conversational style had significant interaction effects on social, functional, and behavioral intent outcomes. Social-oriented digital assistants lead to superior social outcomes (enhanced perceptions of two-way interactivity and trust in the integrity of the site) for older users with high Internet competency, who need less task-related assistance. On the other hand, low-competency older users showed significantly superior cognitive (lower perceived information load) and functional outcomes (greater perceived ease and self-efficacy of using the site) when the digital assistant employed a task-oriented interaction style. Theoretical and agent design implications are discussed.

ID RECONSTRUCTION; EXTRAPOLATION
AB A magnetic resonance image may contain truncation artifacts if there are not enough high-frequency data when the conventional Fourier transform method is used for reconstruction. In this paper we propose a method for reducing the artifacts using a multilayer neural network. The network consists of one linear output layer and at least one nonlinear hidden layer. In this method the missing high-frequency components are predicted based on known low-frequency components and are used to reduce the truncation artifacts of the image. The method is tested with simulated data with good results.

ID RISK; LANGUAGE; READERS; MODEL
AB A large body of research supports the efficacy of small group reading interventions for students in Grades K through 3. However, there are few studies evaluating the effects of supplemental Tier-2 intervention implemented within a response to intervention (RTI) or multitiered systems of support (MTSS) framework. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of providing Tier-2 supplemental intervention to students in Grades I through 3 identified as experiencing reading difficulties (n = 318) in four elementary schools across four different school districts that were selected to participate in a state MTSS initiative. The supplemental intervention was evaluated using a regression discontinuity design, and results indicated statistically significant overall effects on measures of phonemic awareness and word decoding and no discernable effects on reading fluency and comprehension. Results suggest that supplemental reading intervention implemented within MTSS frameworks can impact key reading outcomes when intervention significantly increases instructional intensity.

AB To help agricultural advisors to propose innovative crop management systems, simulation models can be a complementary tool to field experiments and prototyping. Crop management systems can be model led either by using a vector representing dates and quantities used as input parameters in crop models or by developing specific decision models linked with biophysical models. The general design process of crop management systems by simulation follows a four-step loop (GSEC): (i) generation; (ii) simulation: (iii) evaluation; (iv) comparison and choice. The Generation step can follow different approaches: from blind generation before Simulation to optimization procedures using artificial intelligence algorithms during the loop process. Simulation is mainly an engineering problem. Evaluation process means assigning a vector of indicators to the simulated crop management systems. A three-point evaluation can be carried out oil the Simulated crop management systems: global, agronomic and analytical. Comparison and choice of different simulated crop management systems raise the question of "monetary" versus "non-monetary" comparison and how to aggregate different quantities such as drainage, nitrogen fertilisers, labour, etc. Different examples are given to illustrate the GSEC loop oil the basis of research programs conducted in France. Methodological advances and challenges are then discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID TIME
AB Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a dynamic mapping that can capture time-varying, accumulative effects in a sequence that static, feedforward neural networks (NNs) cannot. Long short-term memory (LSTM) NNs are a type of RNN that have gained recent popularity because the cell structure allows them to retain long-term information more efficiently than traditional RNNs. Existing results develop LSTM-based controllers to compensate for uncertainties in nonlinear systems. However, these results use discrete-time LSTMs with offline-trained weights. In this letter, a Lyapunov-based LSTM controller is developed for general Euler-Lagrange systems. Specifically, an Lb-LSTM is implemented in the control design to adaptively estimate uncertain model dynamics, where the weight estimates of the LSTM cell are updated using Lyapunov-based adaptation laws. This allows the LSTM cell to adapt to system uncertainties without requiring offline training. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis yields uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the tracking errors and LSTM state and weight estimation errors. Simulations indicate the developed Lb-LSTM-based controller yielded significant improvement in tracking and function approximation performance when compared to several DNN examples.

ID CORRENTROPY
AB This paper presents a new loss function for neural network classification, inspired by the recently proposed similarity measure called Correntropy. We show that this function essentially behaves like the conventional square loss for samples that are well within the decision boundary and have small errors, and L-o or counting norm for samples that are outliers or are difficult to classify. Depending on the value of the kernel size parameter, the proposed loss function moves smoothly from convex to non-convex and becomes a close approximation to the misclassification loss (ideal 0-1 loss). We show that the discriminant function obtained by optimizing the proposed loss function in the neighborhood of the ideal 0-1 loss function to train a neural network is immune to overfitting, more robust to outliers, and has consistent and better generalization performance as compared to other commonly used loss functions, even after prolonged training. The results also show that it is a close competitor to the SVM. Since the proposed method is compatible with simple gradient based online learning, it is a practical way of improving the performance of neural network classifiers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Soil temperature is a key meteorological parameter that plays an important role in determining rates of physical, chemical and biological reactions in the soil. Ground temperature can vary substantially under different land cover types and climatic conditions. Proper prediction of soil temperature is thus essential for the accurate simulation of land surface processes. In this study, two intelligent neural models-artificial neural networks (ANNs) and Sperm Swarm Optimization (SSO) were used for estimating of soil temperatures at four depths (5, 10, 20, 50 cm) using seven-year meteorological data acquired from Archbold Biological Station in South Florida. The results of this study in subtropical grazinglands of Florida showed that the integrated artificial neural network and SSO models (MLP-SSO) were more accurate tools than the original structure of artificial neural network methods for soil temperature forecasting. In conclusion, this study recommends the hybrid MLP-SSO model as a suitable tool for soil temperature prediction at different soil depths.

AB Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of dementia. The long progression period in Alzheimer's disease provides a possibility for patients to get early treatment by having routine screenings. However, current clinical diagnostic imaging tools do not meet the specific requirements for screening procedures due to high cost and limited availability. In this work, we took the initiative to evaluate the retina, especially the retinal vasculature, as an alternative for conducting screenings for dementia patients caused by Alzheimer's disease. Highly modular machine learning techniques were employed throughout the whole pipeline. Utilizing data from the UK Biobank, the pipeline achieved an average classification accuracy of 82.44%. Besides the high classification accuracy, we also added a saliency analysis to strengthen this pipeline's interpretability. The saliency analysis indicated that within retinal images, small vessels carry more information for diagnosing Alzheimer's diseases, which aligns with related studies.

AB With millions of people using ride-hailing platforms for daily travel, estimated time of arrival (ETA) has become a significant problem in intelligent transportation systems and attracted considerable attention recently. Deep learning-based ETA methods have achieved promising results using massive spatial-temporal data. However, we find that the prediction accuracy is not satisfactory in practical applications due to the prevalent data sparsity problems. Instead of focusing on the average prediction performance as many other methods, this study aims to alleviate the data sparsity problems in ETA to enhance user experience. In general, the data sparsity problems arise from two aspects. The first is the road network, where many links are only traversed by few floating cars. The second aspect is drivers, where many drivers' trajectories are too scarce (e.g., with only 3 trip records). To alleviate the sparsity in road network, we propose a Road Network Metric Learning framework for ETA (), where an auxiliary metric learning task is used to improve the link-embedding, especially for links with insufficient data. A novel triangle loss is proposed to improve metric learning effectiveness for links. Experiments on massive real-world data show that outperforms competing methods by promoting the cold links with limited data. Furthermore, we propose a novel unified framework to Alleviate Data Sparsity problems in ETA () by extending with an additional auxiliary task for driver ID embedding.

AB Author summary
   Patient triage is a critical decision for clinicians. Patients with suspected arbovirus infection are difficult to diagnose as symptoms can be vague and molecular testing can be expensive or unavailable. Determining whether these patients should be hospitalized or not can be challenging, especially in resource-limited settings. Our study included data from 543 subjects with a diagnosis of suspected dengue, chikungunya, or Zika infection. Using a machine learning approach, we tested the ability of seven algorithms to predict hospitalization status based on the signs, symptoms, and laboratory data that would be available to a clinician at patient intake. Using only signs and symptoms, we were able to predict hospitalization with high accuracy (94%). Including laboratory data also resulted in highly accurate prediction of hospitalization (92%). This tool should be tested in future studies with new subject data. Upon further development, we envision a simple mobile application to aid in the decision-making process for clinicians in areas with limited resources.
   Background
   Dengue, chikungunya, and Zika are arboviruses of major global health concern. Decisions regarding the clinical management of suspected arboviral infection are challenging in resource-limited settings, particularly when deciding on patient hospitalization. The objective of this study was to determine if hospitalization of individuals with suspected arboviral infections could be predicted using subject intake data.
   Methodology/Principal findings
   Two prediction models were developed using data from a surveillance study in Machala, a city in southern coastal Ecuador with a high burden of arboviral infections. Data were obtained from subjects who presented at sentinel medical centers with suspected arboviral infection (November 2013 to September 2017). The first prediction model-called the Severity Index for Suspected Arbovirus (SISA)-used only demographic and symptom data. The second prediction model-called the Severity Index for Suspected Arbovirus with Laboratory (SISAL)-incorporated laboratory data. These models were selected by comparing the prediction ability of seven machine learning algorithms; the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve from the prediction of a test dataset was used to select the final algorithm for each model. After eliminating those with missing data, the SISA dataset had 534 subjects, and the SISAL dataset had 98 subjects. For SISA, the best prediction algorithm was the generalized boosting model, with an AUC of 0.91. For SISAL, the best prediction algorithm was the elastic net with an AUC of 0.94. A sensitivity analysis revealed that SISA and SISAL are not directly comparable to one another.

DE Hardware Trojan (HT) detection; integrated circuit (IC) security and
   trust; K-means clustering; one-class support vector machine (SVM);
   reverse-engineering (RE)-based HT detection
AB Due to design and fabrication outsourcing to foundries, the problem of malicious modifications to integrated circuits (ICs), also known as hardware Trojans (HTs), has attracted attention in academia as well as industry. To reduce the risks associated with Trojans, researchers have proposed different approaches to detect them. Among these approaches, test-time detection approaches have drawn the greatest attention. Many test-time approaches assume the existence of a Trojan-free (TF) chip/model also known as "golden model." Prior works suggest using reverse engineering (RE) to identify such TF ICs for the golden model. However, they did not state how to do this efficiently. In fact, RE is a very costly process which consumes lots of time and intensive manual effort. It is also very error prone. In this paper, we propose an innovative and robust RE scheme to identify the TF ICs. We reformulate the Trojan-detection problem as clustering problem. We then adapt a widely used machine learning method, K-means clustering, to solve our problem. Simulation results using state-of-the-art tools on several publicly available circuits show that the proposed approach can detect HTs with high accuracy rate. A comparison of this approach with our previously proposed approach [1] is also conducted. Both the limitations and application scenarios of the two methods are discussed in detail.

AB Responders need tools to rapidly detect and identify airborne alpha radioactivity during consequence management scenarios. Traditional continuous air monitoring systems used for this purpose compute the net counts in various energy windows to determine the presence of specified isotopes, such as U-235, Pu-239, and Am-241. These calculations rely on having a well-calibrated detector, which is challenging in low-background environments. Here, an alternative approach of using artificial neural networks to classify alpha spectra is presented. Two network architectures, fully connected and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), were trained to classify alpha spectra into four categories: background and background plus the three isotopes above. Sources were injected into measured background at various fractions of the derived response level (DRL) corresponding to early-phase Protective Action Guides. The convolutional network identifies all sources at 1% of the DRL with average probability of detection of 95% and false alarm probability of 1%. Further, the network identifies sources ranging between 0.25% and 1% of the DRL with higher than 80% probability of detection and lower than 7% false alarm probability. Most significantly, the network performance improves in low-count background conditions, increasing its minimum probability of detection to 93% and reducing the false alarm probabilities to lower than 0.25%. These results show that, once trained on datasets representing a range of detection scenarios, artificial neural networks can accurately identify alpha isotopes of interest without the need for detector calibration.

AB Persistent homology captures the evolution of topological features of a model as a parameter changes. The most commonly used summary statistics of persistent homology are the barcode and the persistence diagram. Another summary statistic, the persistence landscape, was recently introduced by Bubenik. It is a functional summary, so it is easy to calculate sample means and variances, and it is straightforward to construct various test statistics. Implementing a permutation test we detect conformational changes between closed and open forms of the maltose-binding protein, a large biomolecule consisting of 370 amino acid residues. Furthermore, persistence landscapes can be applied to machine learning methods. A hyperplane from a support vector machine shows the clear separation between the closed and open proteins conformations. Moreover, because our approach captures dynamical properties of the protein our results may help in identifying residues susceptible to ligand binding; we show that the majority of active site residues and allosteric pathway residues are located in the vicinity of the most persistent loop in the corresponding filtered VietorisRips complex. This finding was not observed in the classical anisotropic network model.

AB Citrus black spot (CBS) is a fungal disease caused by Phyllosticta citricarpa (synonym Guignardia citricarpa). CBS causes fruit lesions and significant yield loss in all citrus (Citrus) species. The most distinguishing CBS symptom is called hard spot, which is a circular lesion with gray tissue at the center surrounded by a black margin. The spectral characteristic of CBS lesions was investigated and compared with the spectral signature of healthy fruit tissue to determine the best distinguishing wave band. Healthy and CBS-affected samples presented similar reflectance below 500 nm and above 900 nm. However, healthy samples reflected more light between 500 and 900 nm, especially within the visible band. Also, spectral reflectance of the same symptomatic lesion was acquired six times over a 2-month period to determine the variation of symptom's spectral signatures over time after being harvested. A two-sample t test was employed to compare each pair of consecutive repetitions. The results showed that the spectral signature of the CBS lesion did not change significantly over 2 months. The wavelengths between 587 and 589 nm were identified as the distinguishing band to develop a monochrome vision-based sensor for CBS diagnosis. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was trained using the spectral reflectance data at the selected bands to identify CBS-affected samples in each repetition. The overall CBS detection accuracies varied between 93.3% and 94.6%.

AB Unoccupied aerial system (UAS; i.e., drone equipped with sensors) field-based high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) platforms are used to collect high quality images of plant nurseries to screen genetic materials (e.g., hybrids and inbreds) throughout plant growth at relatively low cost. In this study, a set of 100 advanced breeding maize (Zea mays L.) hybrids were planted at optimal (OHOT trial) and delayed planting dates (DHOT trial). Twelve UAS surveys were conducted over the trials throughout the growing season. Fifteen vegetative indices (VIs) and the 99th percentile canopy height measurement (CHMs) were extracted from processed UAS imagery (orthomosaics and point clouds) which were used to predict plot-level grain yield, days to anthesis (DTA), and silking (DTS). A novel statistical approach utilizing a nested design was fit to predict temporal best linear unbiased predictors (TBLUP) for the combined temporal UAS data. Our results demonstrated machine learning-based regressions (ridge, lasso, and elastic net) had from 4- to 9-fold increases in the prediction accuracies and from 13- to 73-fold reductions in root mean squared error (RMSE) compared to classical linear regression in prediction of grain yield or flowering time. Ridge regression performed best in predicting grain yield (prediction accuracy = similar to 0.6), while lasso and elastic net regressions performed best in predicting DTA and DTS (prediction accuracy = similar to 0.8) consistently in both trials. We demonstrated that predictor variable importance descended towards the terminal stages of growth, signifying the importance of phenotype collection beyond classical terminal growth stages. This study is among the first to demonstrate an ability to predict yield in elite hybrid maize breeding trials using temporal UAS image-based phenotypes and supports the potential benefit of phenomic selection approaches in estimating breeding values before harvest.

AB In the dynamic field of concrete technology, a discernible shift towards sustainability is evident, prompted by the need to minimize reliance on natural resources and reduce the environmental impact of the concrete industry. This transformation involves exploring alternative materials, specifically recycled waste and by-products like seashells, to create eco-friendly green concrete. Seashell waste, abundant in coastal areas, proves promising as a partial or total substitute for fine and coarse aggregates, while seashell powder acts as a sustainable binder, significantly reducing the carbon footprint of cement in concrete production. This study employs three boosting algorithms (Extreme Gradient Boosting, Histogram Gradient Boosting, and Categorical Boosting) and recent optimization algorithms to develop predictive machine learning (ML) models for seashell-containing concrete's compressive, flexural, and tensile strengths. Two ensemble methods (Weighted Averaging and Dempster-Shafer) enhance model robustness by integrating optimization algorithms, promoting compatibility with diverse datasets. Results show that the Quadratic Interpolation Optimization algorithm notably improves accuracy, particularly in Extreme Gradient Boosting, boosting prediction accuracy by 28%, 40%, and 24% in compressive, flexural, and tensile strength estimation. Beyond technical advancements, the research addresses global concerns, highlighting the environmental benefits of an equal proportion of seashells and cement for optimal strength in practical applications, particularly in compressive and tensile strength.

ID PROTEINS
AB Glycosylation is the most common form of post-translational modification of proteins, critically affecting their structure and function. Using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry for high-resolution site-specific quantification of glycopeptides coupled with high-throughput artificial intelligence-powered data processing, we analyzed differential protein glycoisoform distributions of 597 abundant serum glycopeptides and nonglycosylated peptides in 50 individuals who had been seriously ill with COVID-19 and in 22 individuals who had recovered after an asymptomatic course of COVID-19. As additional comparison reference phenotypes, we included 12 individuals with a history of infection with a common cold coronavirus, 16 patients with bacterial sepsis, and 15 healthy subjects without history of coronavirus exposure. We found statistically significant differences, at FDR < 0.05, for normalized abundances of 374 of the 597 peptides and glycopeptides interrogated between symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. Similar statistically significant differences were seen when comparing symptomatic COVID-19 patients to healthy controls (350 differentially abundant peptides and glycopeptides) and common cold coronavirus seropositive subjects (353 differentially abundant peptides and glycopeptides). Among healthy controls and sepsis patients, 326 peptides and glycopeptides were found to be differentially abundant, of which 277 overlapped with biomarkers that showed differential expression between symptomatic COVID-19 cases and healthy controls. Among symptomatic COVID-19 cases and sepsis patients, 101 glycopeptide and peptide biomarkers were found to be statistically significantly abundant. Using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, we found specific glycoprotein profiles to be strongly predictive of symptomatic COVID-19 infection. LASSO-regularized multivariable logistic regression and K-means clustering yielded accuracies of 100% in an independent test set and of 96% overall, respectively. Our findings are consistent with the interpretation that a majority of glycoprotein modifications observed which are shared among symptomatic COVID-19 and sepsis patients likely represent a generic consequence of a severe systemic immune and inflammatory state. However, there are glycoisoform changes that are specific and particular to severe COVID-19 infection. These may be representative of either COVID-19-specific consequences or susceptibility to or predisposition for a severe course of the disease. Our findings support the potential value of glycoproteomic biomarkers in the biomedical understanding and, potentially, the clinical management of serious acute infectious conditions.

AB Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) encompasses the strategies and methodologies used in constructing AI systems that enable end -users to comprehend and interpret the outputs and predictions made by AI models. The increasing deployment of opaque AI applications in highstakes fields, particularly healthcare, has amplified the need for clarity and explainability. This stems from the potential high -impact consequences of erroneous AI predictions in such critical sectors. The effective integration of AI models in healthcare hinges on the capacity of these models to be both explainable and interpretable. Gaining the trust of healthcare professionals necessitates AI applications to be transparent about their decision -making processes and underlying logic. Our paper conducts a systematic review of the various facets and challenges of XAI within the healthcare realm. It aims to dissect a range of XAI methodologies and their applications in healthcare, categorizing them into six distinct groups: feature -oriented methods, global methods, concept models, surrogate models, local pixel -based methods, and human -centric approaches. Specifically, this study focuses on the significance of XAI in addressing healthcarerelated challenges, underscoring its vital role in safety -critical scenarios. Our objective is to provide an exhaustive exploration of XAI's applications in healthcare, alongside an analysis of relevant experimental outcomes, thereby fostering a holistic understanding of XAI's role and potential in this critical domain.

AB While the design practice in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry continues to be a creative activity, approaching the design problem from a perspective of the decision-making science has remarkable potentials that manifest in the delivery of high-performing sustainable structures. These possible gains can be attributed to the myriad of decision-making tools and technologies that can be implemented to assist design efforts, such as artificial intelligence (AI) that combines computational power and data wisdom. Such combination comes to extreme importance amid the mounting pressure on the AEC industry players to deliver economic, environmentally friendly, and socially considerate structures. Despite the promising potentials, the utilization of AI, particularly reinforced learning (RL), to support multidisciplinary design endeavours in the AEC industry is still in its infancy. Thus, the present research discusses developing and applying a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model, an RL application, to assist the preliminary multidisciplinary design efforts in the AEC industry. The experimental work shows that MDP models can expedite identifying viable design alternatives within the solutions space in multidisciplinary design while maximizing the likelihood of finding the optimal design.

AB An Information Retrieval (IR) system consists of document collection, queries issued by users. and the matching/ranking functions used to rank documents in the predicted order of relevance for a given query. A variety of ranking functions have been used in the literature. But studies show that these functions do not perform consistently well across different contexts. In this paper we propose a two-stage integrated framework for discovering and optimizing ranking functions used in IR. The first stage, discovery process, is accomplished by intelligently leveraging the structural and statistical information available in HTML documents by using Genetic Programming techniques to yield novel ranking functions. in the second stage, the optimization process, document retrieval scores of various well-known ranking functions are combined using Genetic Algorithms. The overall discovery and optimization framework is tested oil the well-known TREC collection of web documents for both the ad-hoc retrieval task and the routing task. Utilizing our framework we observe a significant increase in retrieval performance compared to some of the well-known stand alone ranking functions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Through enviromics, precision breeding leverages innovative geotechnologies to customize crop varieties to specific environments, potentially improving both crop yield and genetic selection gains. In Brazil's four southernmost states, data from 183 distinct geographic field trials (also accounting for 2017-2021) covered information on 164 genotypes: 79 phenotyped maize hybrid genotypes for grain yield and their 85 nonphenotyped parents. Additionally, 1342 envirotypic covariates from weather, soil, sensor-based, and satellite sources were collected to engineer 10 K synthetic enviromic markers via machine learning. Soil, radiation light, and surface temperature variations remarkably affect differential genotype yield, hinting at ecophysiological adjustments including evapotranspiration and photosynthesis. The enviromic ensemble-based random regression model showcases superior predictive performance and efficiency compared to the baseline and kernel models, matching the best genotypes to specific geographic coordinates. Clustering analysis has identified regions that minimize genotype-environment (G x E) interactions. These findings underscore the potential of enviromics in crafting specific parental combinations to breed new, higher-yielding hybrid crops. The adequate use of envirotypic information can enhance the precision and efficiency of maize breeding by providing important inputs about the environmental factors that affect the average crop performance. Generating enviromic markers associated with grain yield can enable a better selection of hybrids for specific environments.

AB Forest canopy cover (FCC) is one of the most important forest inventory parameters and plays a critical role in evaluating forest functions. This study examines the potential of integrating Sentinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) data to map FCC in the heterogeneous Mediterranean oak forests of western Iran in different data densities (one-year datasets vs. three-year datasets). This study used very high-resolution satellite images from Google Earth, gridded points, and field inventory plots to generate a reference dataset. Based on it, four FCC classes were defined, namely non-forest, sparse forest (FCC = 1-30%), medium-density forest (FCC = 31-60%), and dense forest (FCC > 60%). In this study, three machine learning (ML) models, including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART), were used in the Google Earth Engine and their performance was compared for classification. Results showed that the SVM produced the highest accuracy on FCC mapping. The three-year time series increased the ability of all ML models to classify FCC classes, in particular the sparse forest class, which was not distinguished well by the one-year dataset. Class-level accuracy assessment results showed a remarkable increase in F-1 scores for sparse forest classification by integrating S-1 and S-2 (10.4% to 18.2% increased for the CART and SVM ML models, respectively). In conclusion, the synergetic use of S-1 and S-2 spectral temporal metrics improved the classification accuracy compared to that obtained using only S-2. The study relied on open data and freely available tools and can be integrated into national monitoring systems of FCC in Mediterranean oak forests of Iran and neighboring countries with similar forest attributes.

ID DISCLOSURE
AB We study the problem where a decision maker uses a linear classifier over attribute values (e. g., age, income, etc.) to classify agents into classes (e. g., creditworthy or not). Sometimes the attribute values are altered and/or hidden by agents to obtain a favorable but undeserved classification. Our main goal is to develop methods to thwart agents from hiding or distorting attribute values to obtain a favorable but incorrect classification. Intentionally altered attributes to obtain strategic goals have been studied. In this paper we develop methods that handle strategic hiding (i.e., nondisclosure) and then merge them with methods to thwart strategic distortion in the context of classification.

AB This letter presents a novel estimator and predictor framework for target tracking applications that estimates the pose of a mobile target that intermittently leaves the field-of-view (FOV) of a mobile agent's camera. Specifically, the framework uses an attention deep motion model network (DMMN) to estimate the dynamics of the target when the target is in the agent's FOV and uses the DMMN to predict the position, orientation, and velocity of the target when the target is outside the agent's FOV. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is performed to determine the maximum dwell-time condition on target measurement availability, and experimental results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework.

AB Intratumoral heterogeneity arising from tumor evolution poses significant challenges biologically and clinically. Dissecting this complexity may benefit from deep learning (DL) algorithms, which can infer molecular features from ubiquitous hematoxylin and eosin (H & E)-stained tissue sections. Although DL algorithms have been developed to predict some driver mutations from H & E images, the ability of these DL algorithms to resolve intratumoral mutation heterogeneity at subclonal spatial resolution is unexplored. Here, we apply DL to a paradigm of intratumoral heterogeneity, clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the most common type of kidney cancer. Matched IHC and H & E images were leveraged to develop DL models for predicting intratumoral genetic heterogeneity of the three most frequently mutated ccRCC genes, BAP1, PBRM1 , and SETD2. DL models were generated on a large cohort (N = 1,282) and tested on several independent cohorts, including a TCGA cohort (N= 363 patients) and two tissue microarray (TMA) cohorts (N = 118 and 365 patients). These models were also expanded to a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) TMA, affording analysis of homo-topic and heterotopic interactions of tumor and stroma. The status of all three genes could be inferred by DL, with BAP1 showing the highest sensitivity and performance within and across tissue sam -ples (AUC = 0.87-0.89 on holdout). BAP1 results were validated on independent human (AUC = 0.77-0.84) and PDX (AUC = 0.80) cohorts. Finally, BAP1 predictions correlated with clinical outputs such as disease-specific survival. Overall, these data show that DL models can resolve intratumoral heterogeneity in cancer with potential diagnostic, prognostic, and biological implications. Significance: This work demonstrates the potential for deep learning analysis of histopathologic images to serve as a fast, low-cost method to assess genetic intratumoral heterogeneity.

AB Most published studies identify groundwater extraction as the leading cause of land subsidence (LS). However, the causes of LS are not only attributable to groundwater extraction. Other land-use practices can also affect the occurrence of LS. In this study, radar interferometric techniques and machine learning (ML) models were used for the prediction, susceptibility zoning, and prioritization of influential variables in the occurrence of LS in the Bakhtegan basin. The LS rate was characterized by applying an interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). The recursive feature elimination (RFE) method was used to detect and select the dominant combination of indicators to prepare an LS susceptibility map. Three ML models, including random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and classification and regression trees (CART), were used to develop predictive models. All three models had acceptable performance. Among the ML models, the RF model performed the best (i.e., Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, Kling-Gupta efficiency, correlation coefficient, and percent bias metrics of 0.76, 0.78, 0.88, and 0.70 for validating phase, respectively). The analysis conducted on all three ML model outputs showed that high and very high LS susceptibility classes were located on or near irrigated agricultural land. The results indicate that the leading cause of land LS in the study region is not due to groundwater withdrawals. Instead, the distance from dams and the proximity to anticlines, faults, and mines are the most important identifiers of LS susceptibility. Additionally, the highest probability of LS susceptibility was found at distances less than 18 km from synclines, 6 to 13 km from anticlines, 23 km from dams, and distances less than 20 to more than 144 km from mines. The validated methods presented in this study are reproducible, transferrable, and recommended for mapping LS susceptibility in semiarid and arid climate zones with similar environmental conditions.

AB Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks excel at capturing short- and long-term dependencies, making them powerful tools for system identification and state estimation. Their unique design improves memory capabilities by retaining important information and discarding irrelevant data over time. However, due to mathematical challenges involved in developing adaptive control methods for LSTMs, their training is predominantly limited to offline methods. This letter develops a Lyapunov-based (Lb-) LSTM observer for state estimation in nonlinear systems. The Lb-LSTM weights adapt in real-time using Lyapunov-based stability-driven adaptation laws. A nonsmooth Lyapunov-based stability analysis ensures state estimation error convergence and stability of the overall Lb-LSTM architecture. To validate the developed observer design, simulations were performed to estimate the unknown angular velocity states of a two-link robot manipulator. The developed method yielded a 41.13% improvement in the root mean square estimation error when compared to an adaptive RNN observer.

AB With the rapid growth in the demand for location-based services in indoor environments, wireless fingerprint localization has attracted increasing attention because of its high precision and easy implementation. However, an effective method does not exist owing to the problems of data loss, noise interference in the fingerprint database, and being time-consuming during the offline training phase. Therefore, this paper presents a novel indoor wireless fingerprint localization algorithm, termed BLS-Location, based on a broad learning system (BLS) that utilizes channel state information (CSI) to overcome the aforementioned problems. It includes an offline training phase and an online localization phase. In the offline training phase, the Kalman filter and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm are utilized for completing and denoising the data. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reconstruct the CSI data to reduce complexity and train the weights by BLS. In the online localization phase, we employ a novel probabilistic method based on the regression results of BLS to obtain the estimated location. The experimental results show that BLS-Location can significantly reduce the training time with a high accuracy, compared to several machine learning algorithms and four existing methods in two representative indoor environments.

AB DYT1 or DYT-TOR1A dystonia is early-onset generalized dystonia caused by a trinucleotide deletion of GAG in the TOR1A or DYT1 gene leads to the loss of a glutamic acid residue in the resulting torsinA protein. A mouse model with overt dystonia is of unique importance to better understand the DYT1 pathophysiology and evaluate preclinical drug efficacy. DYT1 dystonia is likely a network disorder involving multiple brain regions, particularly the basal ganglia. Tor1a conditional knockout in the striatum or cerebral cortex leads to motor deficits, suggesting the importance of corticostriatal connection in the pathogenesis of dystonia. Indeed, corticostriatal long-term depression impairment has been demonstrated in multiple targeted DYT1 mouse models. Pappas and colleagues developed a conditional knockout line (Dlx-CKO) that inactivated Tor1a in the forebrain and surprisingly displayed overt dystonia. We set out to validate whether conditional knockout affecting both cortex and striatum would lead to overt dystonia and whether machine learning-based video behavioral analysis could be used to facilitate high throughput preclinical drug screening. We generated Dlx-CKO mice and found no overt dystonia or motor deficits at 4 months. At 8 months, retesting revealed motor deficits in rotarod, beam walking, grip strength, and hyperactivity in the open field; however, no overt dystonia was visually discernible or through the machine learning-based video analysis. Consistent with other targeted DYT1 mouse models, we observed agedependent deficits in the beam walking test, which is likely a better motor behavioral test for preclinical drug testing but more labor-intensive when overt dystonia is absent.

AB The purpose of this paper is to describe the design and implementation of an unmanned ground vehicle, called the TailGator at CIMAR (Center for Intelligent Machines and Robotics) of the University of Florida. The TailGator is a gas powered, four-wheeled vehicle that was designed for the AUVS1 Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition and has been tested in the contest for 2 years. The vehicle control model and design of the sensory systems are described. The competition is comprised of two events called the Autonomous Challenge and the Navigation Challenge: For the autonomous challenge, line following, obstacle avoidance, and detection are required. Line following is accomplished with a camera system. Obstacle avoidance and detection are accomplished with a laser scanner. For the navigation challenge, waypoint following and obstacle detection are required. The waypoint navigation is implemented with a global positioning system. The TailGator has provided an educational test bed for not only the contest requirements but also other studies in developing artificial intelligence algorithms such as adaptive control, creative control, automatic calibration, and internet-base control. The significance of this effort is in helping engineering and technology students understand the transition from theory to practice.

AB Coffee Breeding programs have traditionally relied on observing plant characteristics over years, a slow and costly process. Genomic selection (GS) offers a DNA-based alternative for faster selection of superior cultivars. Stacking Ensemble Learning (SEL) combines multiple models for potentially even more accurate selection. This study explores SEL potential in coffee breeding, aiming to improve prediction accuracy for important traits [yield (YL), total number of the fruits (NF), leaf miner infestation (LM), and cercosporiosis incidence (Cer)] in Coffea Arabica. We analyzed data from 195 individuals genotyped for 21,211 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. To comprehensively assess model performance, we employed a cross-validation (CV) scheme. Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (GBLUP), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), Quantile Random Forest (QRF), and Random Forest (RF) served as base learners. For the meta-learner within the SEL framework, various options were explored, including Ridge Regression, RF, GBLUP, and Single Average. The SEL method was able to predict the predictive ability (PA) of important traits in Coffea Arabica. SEL presented higher PA compared with those obtained for all base learner methods. The gains in PA in relation to GBLUP were 87.44% (the ratio between the PA obtained from best Stacking model and the GBLUP), 37.83%, 199.82%, and 14.59% for YL, NF, LM and Cer, respectively. Overall, SEL presents a promising approach for GS. By combining predictions from multiple models, SEL can potentially enhance the PA of GS for complex traits.

ID SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; ROBUST
AB Although zero-shot learning (ZSL) has gained widespread concern due to its excellent capacity of recognizing new object classes without seeing any visual instances, most existing methods assume that all seen-class instances used for training are correctly labeled. In some real application scenarios, when it comes to noisy labels, ZSL will inevitably suffer accuracy collapse. To address the issue, a two-stage denoising framework (TSDF) is proposed for ZSL in this work. First, an ZSLoriented Joint training with co-regularization (JoCoR) is developed, which includes a tailored loss function that helps remove suspected noisy-label instances prior to training a ZSL model. Second, a ramp-style loss function is designed to reduce negative impact brought by the remaining noisy labels. In order to facilitate incorporating the ramp-style loss into deep-architecture based ZSL models, a matched dynamic screening strategy (DSS) is also developed. Unlike the traditional concave-convex procedure (CCCP) framework, DSS handles the nonconvexity of the ramp-style loss without requiring an additional iterative loop, demonstrating notable advantages in efficiency. In addition, DSS could work without a predetermined truncating point in the ramp-style loss. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves exciting results in various noisy-label environments.

TI Automatic Choroid Layer Segmentation from Optical Coherence Tomography
   Images Using Deep Learning
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
ID RETINAL LAYER; THICKNESS; OCT; NETWORKS
AB The choroid layer is a vascular layer in human retina and its main function is to provide oxygen and support to the retina. Various studies have shown that the thickness of the choroid layer is correlated with the diagnosis of several ophthalmic diseases. For example, diabetic macular edema (DME) is a leading cause of vision loss in patients with diabetes. Despite contemporary advances, automatic segmentation of the choroid layer remains a challenging task due to low contrast, inhomogeneous intensity, inconsistent texture and ambiguous boundaries between the choroid and sclera in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) images. The majority of currently implemented methods manually or semi-automatically segment out the region of interest. While many fully automatic methods exist in the context of choroid layer segmentation, more effective and accurate automatic methods are required in order to employ these methods in the clinical sector. This paper proposed and implemented an automatic method for choroid layer segmentation in OCT images using deep learning and a series of morphological operations. The aim of this research was to segment out Bruch's Membrane (BM) and choroid layer to calculate the thickness map. BM was segmented using a series of morphological operations, whereas the choroid layer was segmented using a deep learning approach as more image statistics were required to segment accurately. Several evaluation metrics were used to test and compare the proposed method against other existing methodologies. Experimental results showed that the proposed method greatly reduced the error rate when compared with the other state-of-the-art methods.

TI Impact of model choice in predicting urban forest storm damage when data
   is uncertain
SO LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
LA English
DT Article
DE Machine learning; Hurricane Irma; Data imputation; Wind resistance
ID BIAS CORRECTION; HURRICANES
AB Research that illuminates causes of urban forest storm damage is valuable for planning and management. However, logistical and safety concerns often delay post-storm surveys in urban areas; thus, surveys may include observations with unverified sources of damage. While this uncertainty is often ignored, it can make up a high proportion of the number of damaged trees. The goal of this research was to improve understanding of techniques for modeling storm damage in urban forests. Using urban forest storm damage inventories collected in Florida, post-Hurricane Irma (2017), we tested how different imputation methods, modeling procedures, and damage frequency levels could impact overall model results. We utilized machine learning algorithms Random Forest (RF) and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and generalized linear models (GLM). We found that GLM and RF models gave overall unbiased predictions of damage across all methods and rarity levels, while KNN consistently under-predicted damage. Damage frequency influenced some measures of performance but did not impact variable significance. Imputation methods all identified consistent variables of most significance within each model procedure; however, there was variation among variables ranked moderately important. While both GLM and RF models identified plot tree basal area as highly significant damage predictors, they otherwise disagreed on individual variable importance. These findings suggest that while explanatory models for urban forest storm damage can be achieved by examining linear relationships, more complex relationships such as the ones identified by RF models can have equal explanatory power with different subsets of predictor variables.

AB Objective:HIV molecular transmission network typologies have previously demonstrated associations to transmission risk; however, few studies have evaluated their predictive potential in anticipating future transmission events. To assess this, we tested multiple models on statewide surveillance data from the Florida Department of Health.Design:This was a retrospective, observational cohort study examining the incidence of new HIV molecular linkages within the existing molecular network of persons with HIV (PWH) in Florida.Methods:HIV-1 molecular transmission clusters were reconstructed for PWH diagnosed in Florida from 2006 to 2017 using the HIV-TRAnsmission Cluster Engine (HIV-TRACE). A suite of machine-learning models designed to predict linkage to a new diagnosis were internally and temporally externally validated using a variety of demographic, clinical, and network-derived parameters.Results:Of the 9897 individuals who received a genotype within 12 months of diagnosis during 2012-2017, 2611 (26.4%) were molecularly linked to another case within 1 year at 1.5% genetic distance. The best performing model, trained on two years of data, was high performing (area under the receiving operating curve = 0.96, sensitivity = 0.91, and specificity = 0.90) and included the following variables: age group, exposure group, node degree, betweenness, transitivity, and neighborhood.Conclusions:In the molecular network of HIV transmission in Florida, individuals' network position and connectivity predicted future molecular linkages. Machine-learned models using network typologies performed superior to models using individual data alone. These models can be used to more precisely identify subpopulations for intervention.

AB Advancements in optical communications have increasingly focused on leveraging spatial-structured beams such as orbital angular momentum (OAM) beams for high-capacity data transmission. Conventional electronic convolutional neural networks exhibit constraints in efficiently demultiplexing OAM signals. Here, we introduce a hybrid optical-electronic convolutional neural network that is capable of completing Fourier optics convolution and realizing intensity-recognition-based demultiplexing of multiplexed OAM beams under variable simulated atmospheric turbulent conditions. The core part of our demultiplexing system includes a 4F optics system employing a Fourier optics convolution layer. This optical spatial-filtering-based convolutional neural network is utilized to realize the training and demultiplexing of the 4-bit OAM-coded signals under simulated atmospheric turbulent conditions. The current system shows a demultiplexing accuracy of 72.84% under strong turbulence scenarios with 3.2 times faster training time than all electronic convolutional neural networks.
   Optical beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) are promising candidates for free-space optical communication. The authors devise a hybrid optical-electronic convolutional neural network approach reaching a 4-bit OAM-coded signal demultiplexing accuracy of 72.84% under strong atmospheric turbulence conditions with 3.2 times faster training time than all electronic convolutional neural network.

AB Objective: Although lower respiratory infections (LRI) are among the leading causes of mortality in the US, their association with underlying factors and geographic variation have not been adequately examined.
   Methods: In this study, explanatory variables (n = 46) including climatic, topographic, socio-economic, and demographic factors were compiled at the county level across the continentalUS.Machine learning algorithms - logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM) - were employed to predict the presence/absence of hotspots (P < 0.05) for elevated age-adjusted LRI mortality rates in a geographic information system framework.
   Results: Overall, there was a historical shift in hotspots away from the western US into the southeastern parts of the country and they were highly localized in a few counties. The two decision tree methods (RF and GBDT) outperformed the other algorithms (accuracies: 0.92; F1-scores: 0.85 and 0.84; area under the precision-recall curve: 0.84 and 0.83, respectively). Moreover, the results of the RF and GBDT indicated that higher spring minimum temperature, increased winter precipitation, and higher annual median household income were among the most substantial factors in predicting the hotspots.
   Conclusions: This study helps raise awareness of public health decision-makers to develop and target LRI prevention programs.

AB The solid fumigant 1,3-dichloropropene (1,3-D) formulated with chloropicrin is viewed as a likely alternative for replacing methyl bromide in Florida when the latter is phased out in 2005. Therefore, it behooves us to learn more about using 1,3-D in deep, sand soils. Two trials were conducted on spring squash to determine the most effective rate of 1,3-D for the control of Meloidogyne spp. Rates tested included 0, 56, 84, 112, and 168 liters/ha of 1,3-D applied broadcast with conventional chisels 30 cm deep. The chisel traces were sealed by disking immediately after fumigant application. Cucurbita pepo cv. Sunex 9602 was sown 7 days after fumigation. The population density of plant-parasitic nematodes in soil and root-knot nematode galling severity was determined. The number of fruit and yield were higher in all plots that received 1,3-D than in untreated controls. The number of Meloidogyne spp. second-stage juveniles was lower in all fumigated plots in trial 1 at both 34 and 65 DAP, and in trial 2 at 65 DAP, than in the untreated control. The severity of root galling was decreased with all treatments in both trials, with broadcast rates of 84, 112, and 168 liters/ha providing the best control of root-knot nematodes in spring squash grown in sandy solid. Satisfactory management of root knot on squash grown in early spring months in north Florida can be achieved with low rates of 1,3-D.

AB Neural network (NN) is a representative data-driven method, which is one of prognostics approaches that is to predict future damage/ degradation and the remaining useful life of in-service systems based on the damage data measured at previous usage conditions. Even though NN has a wide range of applications, there are a relatively small number of literature on prognostics compared to the usage in other fields such as diagnostics and pattern recognition. Especially, it is difficult to find studies on statistical aspects of NN for the purpose of prognostics. Therefore, this paper presents the aspects of statistical characteristics of NN that are presumable in practical usages, which arise from measurement data, weight parameters related to the neural network model, and loading conditions. The Bayesian framework and Johnson distribution are employed to handle uncertainties, and crack growth problem is addressed as an example.

TI Vagal sensory neurons mediate the Bezold-Jarisch reflex and induce

DT Article

   DISORDERS; STATES; GAMMA
AB Visceral sensory pathways mediate homeostatic reflexes, the dysfunction of which leads to many neurological disorders1. The Bezold-Jarisch reflex (BJR), first described2,3 in 1867, is a cardioinhibitory reflex that is speculated to be mediated by vagal sensory neurons (VSNs) that also triggers syncope. However, the molecular identity, anatomical organization, physiological characteristics and behavioural influence of cardiac VSNs remain mostly unknown. Here we leveraged single-cell RNA-sequencing data and HYBRiD tissue clearing4 to show that VSNs that express neuropeptide Y receptor Y2 (NPY2R) predominately connect the heart ventricular wall to the area postrema. Optogenetic activation of NPY2R VSNs elicits the classic triad of BJR responses-hypotension, bradycardia and suppressed respiration-and causes an animal to faint. Photostimulation during high-resolution echocardiography and laser Doppler flowmetry with behavioural observation revealed a range of phenotypes reflected in clinical syncope, including reduced cardiac output, cerebral hypoperfusion, pupil dilation and eye-roll. Large-scale Neuropixels brain recordings and machine-learning-based modelling showed that this manipulation causes the suppression of activity across a large distributed neuronal population that is not explained by changes in spontaneous behavioural movements. Additionally, bidirectional manipulation of the periventricular zone had a push-pull effect, with inhibition leading to longer syncope periods and activation inducing arousal. Finally, ablating NPY2R VSNs specifically abolished the BJR. Combined, these results demonstrate a genetically defined cardiac reflex that recapitulates characteristics of human syncope at physiological, behavioural and neural network levels.
   The molecular mechanisms underlying the Bezold-Jarisch reflex and syncope (fainting) involve vagal sensory neurons that express neuropeptide Y receptor Y2, the deletion of which in animal models abolishes the Bezold-Jarisch reflex.

AB The aims of this paper are: to stimulate interest within the civil engineering research community for developing the next generation of applied artificial neural networks; to identify what the next generation of devices needs to achieve, and; to provide direction in terms of how their development may proceed. An analysis of the current situation indicates that progress in the development of this technology has largely stagnated. Suggestions are made for achieving the above goals based on the use of genetic algorithms and related techniques. It is noted that this approach will require the design of some very sophisticated genetic coding mechanisms in order to develop the required higher-order network structures, and may utilize development mechanisms observed in nature such as growth, self-organization, and multi-stage objective functions. The capabilities of such an approach and the way in which they can be achieved are explored in reference to the truck weigh-in-motion problem.

ID TOPOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS
AB Besides topological relationships and approximate relationships, cardinal directions like north and southwest have turned out to be an important class of qualitative spatial relationships. They are of interdisciplinary interest in fields like cognitive science, robotics, artificial intelligence, and qualitative spatial reasoning. In spatial databases and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) they are frequently used as join and selection criteria in spatial queries. However, the available computational models of cardinal directions suffer a number of problems like the use of too coarse approximations of the two spatial operand objects in terms of single representative points or minimum bounding rectangles, the lacking property of converseness of the cardinal directions computed, and the limited applicability to simple instead of complex regions only. This article proposes and formally defines a novel two-phase model, called the Objects Interaction Matrix (OIM) model, that solves these problems, and determines cardinal directions for even complex regions. The model consists of a tiling phase and an interpretation phase. In the tiling phase, a tiling strategy first determines the zones belonging to the nine cardinal directions of each individual region object and then intersects them. The result leads to a bounded grid called objects interaction grid. For each grid cell the information about the region objects that intersect it is stored in an objects interaction matrix. In the subsequent interpretation phase, a well-defined interpretation method is applied to such a matrix and determines the cardinal direction. Spatial example queries illustrate our new cardinal direction concept that is embedded in a spatial extension of SQL and provides user-defined cardinal direction predicates.

AB The citrus industry is an important constituent of Florida's overall agricultural economy. Proper disease control measures must be undertaken in citrus groves to minimize losses. Technological strategies using machine vision and artificial intelligence are being investigated to achieve intelligent farming, including early detection of diseases in groves, selective fungicide application, etc. This research used the color co-occurrence method (CCM) to determine whether texture based hue, saturation, and intensity (HSI) color features in conjunction with statistical classification algorithms could be used to identify diseased and normal citrus leaves under laboratory conditions. Normal and diseased citrus leaf samples with greasy spot, melanose, and scab were evaluated. The leaf sample discriminant analysis using CCM textural features achieved classification accuracies of over 95% for all classes when using hue and saturation texture features. Data models that relied on intensity features suffered a reduction in classification accuracy when categorizing leaf fronts. due to the darker pigmentation of the leaf fronts. This reduction was not experienced on the leaf backs where the lighter pigmentation clearly revealed the disease discoloration. Although, high accuracies were achieved when using an unreduced dataset consisting of all HSI texture features, the overall best performer was determined to be a reduced data model that relied on hue and saturation features. This model was selected due to reduced computational load and the elimination of intensity features, which are not robust in the presence of ambient light variation. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB Hallucinations are an elusive phenomena that has been associated with psychotic behavior, but which has a high prevalence in healthy population. Some models of Auditory Hallucinations (AH) have been proposed in the literature, but so far empirical evidence is scarce. The current study aims to obtain measurement of effective connectivity on rs-fMRI showing discrimination of subjects with a history of AH to give empirical validation of AH models. In this paper, we consider the Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) for the estimation of the effective connection between brain regions on resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Applying DCM to rs-fMRI data is a very recent approach, that allows studies of effective connectivity on rs-fMRI data. Brain regions are selected on the basis of previous results on functional connectivity in agreement with the models proposed in the literature. The selection of the most significant connection structure is carried as a wrapper feature selection process using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. Results on a dataset of Schizophrenia patients with and without a history of AH are provided which are in good agreement with the models in the literature. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Forecasting river flow is important to water resources management and planning. In this study, an artificial neural network (ANN) model was successfully developed to forecast river flow in Apalachicola River. The model used a feed-forward, back-propagation network structure with an optimized conjugated training algorithm. Using long-term observations of rainfall and river flow during 1939-2000, the ANN model was satisfactorily trained and verified. Model predictions of river flow match well with the observations. The correlation coefficients between forecasting and observation for daily, monthly, quarterly and yearly flow forecasting are 0(.)98, 0(.)95, 0(.)91 and 0(.)83, respectively. Results of the forecasted flow rates from the ANN model were compared with those from a traditional autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) forecasting model. Results indicate that the ANN model provides better accuracy in forecasting river flow than does the ARIMA model. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB Substance use disorder (SUD) is a chronic relapsing condition characterized by continued use of drugs despite negative consequences. SUD is thought to involve disordered learning and memory wherein drug-paired cues gain increased salience, and ultimately drive craving and relapse. These types of associations are thought to be encoded within sparsely distributed sets of neurons, called neuronal ensembles, that drive encoded behaviors through synchronous activity of the participant neurons. We have previously found that Fos-expressing neuronal ensembles within the prefrontal cortex are required for well-trained cocaine seeking. However, less is known about how quickly cortical neuronal ensembles form during the initiation of cocaine seeking behavior. Here, we seek to further elucidate the role of Fos-expressing neuronal ensembles within the prelimbic cortex (PL) after the initial acquisition of cocaine self-administration (SA), or, after 10 days of additional SA training (well-trained). We trained Fos-LacZ transgenic rats to lever press for cocaine under an FR1 schedule of reinforcement. Once rats met acquisition criteria for cocaine self-administration, we ablated Fos-expressing neuronal ensembles in the PL using the Daun02 inactivation method, either 1 or 10 days after the rats met the acquisition criteria. Targeted ablation of Fos-expressing neuronal ensembles in the PL attenuated active lever pressing both 1 day and 10 days after rats acquired cocaine self-administration. Together, this suggests that Fos-expressing neuronal ensembles rapidly form in the PL and continue to mediate maintained cocaine seeking behavior.

AB Expressing plant metabolic pathways in microbial platforms is an efficient, cost-effective solution for producing many desired plant compounds. As eukaryotic organisms, yeasts are often the preferred platform. However, expression of plant enzymes in a yeast frequently leads to failure because the enzymes are poorly adapted to the foreign yeast cellular environment. Here, we first summarize the current engineering approaches for optimizing performance of plant enzymes in yeast. A critical limitation of these approaches is that they are labour-intensive and must be customized for each individual enzyme, which significantly hinders the establishment of plant pathways in cellular factories. In response to this challenge, we propose the development of a cost-effective computational pipeline to redesign plant enzymes for better adaptation to the yeast cellular milieu. This proposition is underpinned by compelling evidence that plant and yeast enzymes exhibit distinct sequence features that are generalizable across enzyme families. Consequently, we introduce a data-driven machine learning framework designed to extract 'yeastizing' rules from natural protein sequence variations, which can be broadly applied to all enzymes. Additionally, we discuss the potential to integrate the machine learning model into a full design-build-test cycle.
   Many plant secondary metabolic enzymes need to be re-engineered for optimal performance in yeast platforms due to poor adaptation to the foreign cellular environment. We highlight the challenges in 'yeastizing' plant enzymes and propose a data-driven framework for learning the yeastizing rules from natural protein sequence variations.image

AB Background: Stress is a critical risk factor for various health issues, but an objective, non-intrusive and effective measurement approach for stress has not yet been established. Gait, the pattern of movements in human locomotion, has been proven to be a valid behavioral indicator for recognizing various mental states in a convenient manner. Research Question: This study aims to identify the severity of stress by assessing human gait recorded through an objective, non-intrusive measurement approach. Methods: One hundred and fifty-two participants with an average age of 23 years old (SD = 1.07) were recruited. The Chinese version of the Perceived Stress Scale with 10 items (PSS-10) was used to assess participants' stress levels. The participants were then required to walk naturally while being recorded with a regular camera. A total of 1320 time-domain and 1152 frequency-domain gait features were extracted from the videos. The top 40 contributing features, confirmed by dimensionality reduction, were input into models consisting of four machinelearning regression algorithms (i.e., Gaussian Process Regressor, Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Support Vector regression), to assess stress levels. Results: The models that combined time- and frequency-domain features performed best, with the lowest RMSE (4.972) and highest validation (r = 0.533). The Gaussian Process Regressor and Linear Regression outperformed the others. The greatest contribution to model performance was derived from gait features of the waist, hands, and legs. Significance: The severity of stress can be accurately detected by machine learning models using two-dimensional (2D) video-based gait data. The machine learning models used for assessing perceived stress were reliable. Waist, hand, and leg movements were found to be critical indicator in detecting stress.

AB The application of machine learning approaches to improve groundwater salinity risk mapping is limited despite all potential advantages. Therefore, there is an ongoing need for investigations that present new techniques, like machine learning, validated against conventional methods. These advances are particularly important for arid and semiarid regions, such as the Bakhtegan Basin (southern Iran), where groundwater use may far outweigh recharge, but groundwater management improvements are essential. To address these needs, groundwater salinity hazard, vulnerability, and risk maps were investigated using an integrated application of statistical (i.e., frequency ratio and statistical index models), machine learning (i.e., random forest and classification and regression trees algorithms), and decision-making models (fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP)). Results showed that the risk of groundwater salinity was high in the central areas of the region as well as at the margins of Bakhtegan Lake and irrigated farming lands. Based on the modeling results in the testing phase, it was found that the frequency ratio and random forest models exhibited better performance, with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency metrics of 0.73 and 0.70, respectively, compared to the classification and regression trees and statistical index models, which had Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency metrics of 0.65 and 0.63, respectively. The innovative techniques developed in the current work accurately identified variables such as normalized difference salinity index, distance from mines, and land use associated with the highest weight values (0.59, 0.14, and 0.11, respectively) compared to other variables to identify groundwater salinity areas of vulnerability. The application of the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process method in developing vulnerability maps, integrating them with hazard maps, and developing groundwater salinity risk maps was innovative in this study. The innovative approach is transferrable for groundwater salinity susceptibility, vulnerability, and risk assessments globally in the study area and similar settings.

AB As a consequence of conditioning visual cues with delayed reward, cue-evoked neural activity that predicts the time of expected future reward emerges in the primary visual cortex (V1). We hypothesized that this reward-timing activity is engendered by a reinforcement signal conveying reward acquisition to V1. In lieu of behavioral conditioning, we assessed in vivo whether selective activation of either basal forebrain (BF) or cholinergic innervation is sufficient to condition cued interval-timing activity. Substituting for actual reward, optogenetic activation of BF or cholinergic input within V1 at fixed delays following visual stimulation entrains neural responses that mimic behaviorally conditioned reward-timing activity. Optogenetically conditioned neural responses express cue-evoked temporal intervals that correspond to the conditioning intervals, are bidirectionally modifiable, display experience-dependent refinement, and exhibit a scale invariance to the encoded delay. Our results demonstrate that the activation of BF or cholinergic input within V1 is sufficient to encode cued interval-timing activity and indicate that V1 itself is a substrate for associative learning that may inform the timing of visually cued behaviors.

AB In topological data analysis, persistent homology is used to study the 'shape of data'. Persistent homology computations are completely characterized by a set of intervals called a bar code. It is often said that the long intervals represent the 'topological signal' and the short intervals represent 'noise'. We give evidence to dispute this thesis, showing that the short intervals encode geometric information. Specifically, we prove that persistent homology detects the curvature of disks from which points have been sampled. We describe a general computational framework for solving inverse problems using the average persistence landscape, a continuous mapping from metric spaces with a probability measure to a Hilbert space. In the present application, the average persistence landscapes of points sampled from disks of constant curvature results in a path in this Hilbert space which may be learned using standard tools from statistical and machine learning.

AB In this paper we investigate the use of adaptive extended Luenberger state estimators for general nonlinear and possibly time-varying systems. We identify the connection between the extended Luenberger observer and Grossberg additive model for dynamic neural networks. The association between dynamic neural networks and the Luenberger observer leads to an obvious modification on the proposed observer scheme that would allow handling state estimation for those systems whose dynamic equations are partially known or not known at all. The performance of the adaptive observer is demonstrated on a number of systems including an LTI system, the Van der Pol oscillator the Lorenz attractor and a realistic partial gasoline engine model.

AB This paper investigates whether computer usage profiles comprised of process-, network-, mouse-, and keystroke-related events are unique and consistent over time in a naturalistic setting, discussing challenges and opportunities of using such profiles in applications of continuous authentication. We collected ecologically-valid computer usage profiles from 31 MS Windows 10 computer users over 8 weeks and submitted this data to comprehensive machine learning analysis involving a diverse set of online and offline classifiers. We found that: (i) profiles were mostly consistent over the 8-week data collection period, with most (83.9%) repeating computer usage habits on a daily basis; (ii) computer usage profiling has the potential to uniquely characterize computer users (with a maximum F-score of 99.90%); (iii) network-related events were the most relevant features to accurately recognize profiles (95.69% of the top features distinguishing users were network-related); and (iv) binary models were the most well-suited for profile recognition, with better results achieved in the online setting compared to the offline setting (maximum F-score of 99.90% vs. 95.50%).

TI North Florida dairy farmer perceptions toward the use of seasonal

LA English
DT Article
ID POTENTIAL BENEFITS; AGRICULTURE
AB Evidence of increasing nitrogen levels in the Suwannee River Basin in North Florida demands a collaborative effort to find creative ways to reduce N pollution. This study explores the perspectives, perceptions, and attitudes of dairy farmers regarding adoption of climate forecasts as a potential way to mitigate the problem. These farmers are heavily scrutinized because of their nitrogen emissions. By contrasting scientists' pre-conceived attitudes about the usefulness of ENSO-based forecasts with dairy farmers' perceptions, gathered in a participatory and consensual manner, valuable lessons were learned. A deeper understanding of the day to day realities of dairy farming systems help researchers pinpoint management adaptations that are not only useful, but feasible, in light of improved seasonal climate forecasts. Furthermore, dairy farmers' perceptions regarding the use of seasonal climate information to mitigate the nitrate problem are critical for designing future dairy systems.

AB This paper introduces population digital health (PDH)-the use of digital health information sourced from health internet of things (IoT) and wearable devices for population health modeling-as an emerging research domain that offers an integrated approach for continuous monitoring and profiling of diseases and health conditions at multiple spatial resolutions. PDH combines health data sourced from health IoT devices, machine learning, and ubiquitous computing or networking infrastructure to increase the scale, coverage, equity, and cost-effectiveness of population health. This contrasts with the traditional population health approach, which relies on data from structured clinical records (eg, electronic health records) or health surveys. We present the overall PDH approach and highlight its key research challenges, provide solutions to key research challenges, and demonstrate the potential of PDH through three case studies that address (1) data inadequacy, (2) inaccuracy of the health IoT devices' sensor measurements, and (3) the spatiotemporal sparsity in the available digital health information. Finally, we discuss the conditions, prerequisites, and barriers for adopting PDH drawing on from real-world examples from different geographic regions.

AB The Culex pipiens complex of mosquitoes are significant vectors of several pathogens resulting in infectious human diseases in North America, including but not limited to West Nile encephalitis, Rift Valley Fever, and Lymphatic filariasis. Among this complex are C. pipiens form pipiens and Culex quinquefasciatus. While morphologically similar, the mosquitoes exhibit unique life histories that suit them uniquely to divergent niches, wherein C. pipiens can thrive despite the cold winters of the northern United States and C. quinquefasciatus is able to survive periods of drought typical in the southern states. Here, Random Forests machine-learning algorithms were employed to model and explore which environmental parameters best explain mosquito occurrence in historical trapping data across the continental United States of America, and test correlation with abundance data. The models explained between 71 and 97% of the presence or absence of the two mosquitoes based on historical climatic data. The results of this study will improve vector management programs by explaining which environmental variables will provide the most accurate predictions of mosquito presence at a given site.

AB The development of deep neural network (DNN) has provided transformative impacts on many fields, including computer vision and video recognition. However, the impact is limited by the need for large, labeled datasets to enable effective training. To address this fundamental problem, we propose a novel inter-network system (Dandelion), providing architecture support (Dandelion-architecture) for data augmentation that trains DNNs with rare images generated by the generative adversarial network (GAN) with orthogonal attributes modified (Dandelion-function. The approach can account for the latency requirement and resource limitation of target applications by exploiting data and computation reuses between the two networks; this amortizes the impact of bottleneck brought by GAN and facilitates design of inter-network accelerator. Moreover, we show how to implement two-network design on 3D architecture to further enhance the accelerator. Our results show that with the generated images, DNN yields 13.6% - 37.5% improvement on accuracy, depending on the data scarcity level. Our architecture achieves at least 30% speedup compared with the baseline while 40% of the overhead brought by the incorporation of GAN is reduced in our design compared with ScaleDeep, and 26.3% of performance improvement over TETRIS.

AB Morphological shared weight networks (MSNNs) have been applied to many different problem domains, such as discriminating textures, target and hand written character recognition problems. MSNNs use morphological hit-and-miss transforms (HMT) as the activation functions in the feature extraction layer. However, conventional morphological filters have certain drawbacks. They are not robust and therefore are sensitive to noise. They may not tolerate small changes in gray values and shape. On the other hand, Choquet integral-based morphological operations (CMOs), a natural extension of classical morphological operations, are less sensitive to degradations in an image. The MSNN architecture is extended using CMOs in place of HMTs. These networks are referred to as Choquet morphological shared-weight neural networks (CMSNN). In a related paper, we compared the MSNN and CMSNN by extensive experimentation on the real world problem of land mine detection. In this paper, we discuss the problem of domain learning, which is related to feature importance. We provide examples of successes and failures of generalized mathematical morphology and the Choquet integral. These results are interesting, not only for purposes of robustness. but when viewed in the context of determining more valuable information sources. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

DE Benchmark testing; hardware; optimization; security; tools
AB Benchmarks are the standards by which technologies can be evaluated and fairly compared. In the field of digital circuits, benchmarks were critical for the development of CAD and FPGA tools decades ago. Hardware security is an emerging field of research where new techniques of security and vulnerability of hardware designs are being proposed in higher volume each year. Using decade-old VLSI/CAD-oriented benchmarks for analyzing the techniques has many issues as these benchmarks were not developed for security research. Additionally, the rise of statistical analysis or machine learning (ML) to model vulnerabilities and solve security issues demands a very large set of samples for training purposes. Since the number of available VLSI/CAD benchmarks is limited, such volume can only be obtained through synthetic benchmark generation tools. To accommodate both of these needs, the first hardware security-oriented synthetic circuit benchmark generation framework is developed in this article. With the use of principal component analysis (PCA) and linear optimization tool, the benchmarks generated by the proposed framework are "divergent," that is having maximum variation in structures from each other. By accommodating user inputs for desired features, the framework offers customization for generating richer and more challenging benchmarks for data-driven hardware security. With thorough experimentation, we demonstrate our framework's scalability, the structural and functional variations in the generated benchmarks, and the advantage of structurally variant synthetic benchmarks in hardware security applications.

ID SMOTE
AB Importance Machine learning tools are increasingly deployed for risk prediction and clinical decision support in surgery. Class imbalance adversely impacts predictive performance, especially for low-incidence complications. Objective To evaluate risk-prediction model performance when trained on risk-specific cohorts. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study performed from February 2024 to July 2024 deployed a deep learning model, which generated risk scores for common postoperative complications. A total of 109 445 inpatient operations performed at 2 University of Florida Health hospitals from June 1, 2014, to May 5, 2021 were examined. Exposures The model was trained de novo on separate cohorts for high-risk, medium-risk, and low-risk Common Procedure Terminology codes defined empirically by incidence of 5 postoperative complications: (1) in-hospital mortality; (2) prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay (>= 48 hours); (3) prolonged mechanical ventilation (>= 48 hours); (4) sepsis; and (5) acute kidney injury (AKI). Low-risk and high-risk cutoffs for complications were defined by the lower-third and upper-third prevalence in the dataset, except for mortality, cutoffs for which were set at 1% or less and greater than 3%, respectively. Main Outcomes and Measures Model performance metrics were assessed for each risk-specific cohort alongside the baseline model. Metrics included area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), F1 scores, and accuracy for each model. Results A total of 109 445 inpatient operations were examined among patients treated at 2 University of Florida Health hospitals in Gainesville (77 921 procedures [71.2%]) and Jacksonville (31 524 procedures [28.8%]). Median (IQR) patient age was 58 (43-68) years, and median (IQR) Charlson Comorbidity Index score was 2 (0-4). Among 109 445 operations, 55 646 patients were male (50.8%), and 66 495 patients (60.8%) underwent a nonemergent, inpatient operation. Training on the high-risk cohort had variable impact on AUROC, but significantly improved AUPRC (as assessed by nonoverlapping 95% confidence intervals) for predicting mortality (0.53; 95% CI, 0.43-0.64), AKI (0.61; 95% CI, 0.58-0.65), and prolonged ICU stay (0.91; 95% CI, 0.89-0.92). It also significantly improved F1 score for mortality (0.42; 95% CI, 0.36-0.49), prolonged mechanical ventilation (0.55; 95% CI, 0.52-0.58), sepsis (0.46; 95% CI, 0.43-0.49), and AKI (0.57; 95% CI, 0.54-0.59). After controlling for baseline model performance on high-risk cohorts, AUPRC increased significantly for in-hospital mortality only (0.53; 95% CI, 0.42-0.65 vs 0.29; 95% CI, 0.21-0.40). Conclusion and Relevance In this cross-sectional study, by training separate models using a priori knowledge for procedure-specific risk classes, improved performance in standard evaluation metrics was observed, especially for low-prevalence complications like in-hospital mortality. Used cautiously, this approach may represent an optimal training strategy for surgical risk-prediction models.

AB Muscle fatigue impacts upper extremity function but is often overlooked in biomechanical models. The present work leveraged a transfer learning approach to improve torque predictions during fatiguing upper extremity movements. We developed two artificial neural networks to model sustained elbow flexion: one trained solely on recorded data (i.e., direct learning) and one pre-trained on simulated data and fine-tuned on recorded data (i.e., transfer learning). We simulated muscle activations and joint torques using a musculoskeletal model and a muscle fatigue model (n = 1,701 simulations). We also recorded static subject-specific features (e.g., anthropometric measurements) and dynamic muscle activations and torques during sustained elbow flexion in healthy young adults (n = 25 subjects). Using the simulated dataset, we pre-trained a long short-term memory neural network (LSTM) to regress fatiguing elbow flexion torque from muscle activations. We concatenated this pre-trained LSTM with a feedforward architecture, and fine-tuned the model on recorded muscle activations and static features to predict elbow flexion torques. We trained a similar architecture solely on the recorded data and compared each neural network's predictions on 5 leave-out subjects' data. The transfer learning model outperformed the direct learning model, as indicated by a decrease of 24.9% in their root-mean-square-errors (6.22 Nm and 8.28 Nm, respectively). The transfer learning model and direct learning model outperformed analogous musculoskeletal simulations, which consistently underpredicted elbow flexion torque. Our results suggest that transfer learning from simulated to recorded datasets can decrease reliance on assumptions inherent to biomechanical models and yield predictions robust to real-world conditions.

AB User reviews are now an essential source of information for consumers, exerting strong influence on purchase decisions. Broadly speaking, reviews rated by consumers as more helpful exert a greater influence downstream. The current research examines how the linguistic characteristics of a review affect its helpfulness score. Using a convolutional neural network (CNN), this research analyzes the linguistic subjectivity and objectivity of over 2 million reviews on Amazon. The results show that, ceteris paribus, both linguistic subjectivity and objectivity have a positive impact on review helpfulness. However, contrary to consumers' intuition, when subjectivity and objectivity are combined in the same review, review helpfulness increases less than their respective separate effects would predict, especially for hedonic products. We conceptualize that this results from the increased complexity of messages mixing subjective and objective sentences, which requires more effortful processing. The findings extend the literature on online reviews, word-of-mouth, and text analysis in marketing, and offer practical implications for marketing communication and facilitation of reviews.

AB Purpose The authors have previously shown the feasibility of using an artificial neural network (ANN) to eliminate the volume average effect (VAE) of scanning ionization chambers (ICs). The purpose of this work was to evaluate the method when applied to beams of different energies (6 and 10 MV) and modalities [flattened (FF) vs unflattened (FFF)], measured with ICs of various sizes.
   Methods The three-layer ANN extracted data from transverse photon beam profiles using a sliding window, and output deconvolved value corresponding to the location at the center of the window. Beam profiles of seven fields ranging from 2 x 2 to 10 x 10 cm(2) at four depths (1.5, 5, 10 and 20 cm) were measured with three ICs (CC04, CC13, and FC65-P) and an EDGE diode detector for 6 MV FF and FFF. Similar data for the 10 MV FF beam was also collected with CC13 and EDGE. The EDGE-measured profiles were used as reference data to train and test the ANNs. Separate ANNs were trained by using the data of each beam energy and modality. Combined ANNs were also trained by combining data of different beam energies and/or modalities. The ANN's performance was quantified and compared by evaluating the penumbra width difference (PWD) between the deconvolved and reference profiles.
   Results Excellent agreement between the deconvolved and reference profiles was achieved with both separate and combined ANNs for all studied ICs, beam energies, beam modalities, and geometries. After deconvolution, the average PWD decreased from 1-3 mm to under 0.15 mm with separate ANNs and to under 0.20 mm with combined ANN.
   Conclusions The ANN-based deconvolution method can be effectively applied to beams of different energies and modalities measured with ICs of various sizes. Separate ANNs yielded marginally better results than combined ANNs. An IC-specific, combined ANN can provide clinically acceptable results as long as the training data includes data of each beam energy and modality.

DE Latent Dirichlet allocation; Markov chain Monte Carlo; Mixture model;

AB In latent Dirichlet allocation, the number of topics, T, is a hyperparameter of the model that must be specified before one can fit the model. The need to specify T in advance is restrictive. One way of dealing with this problem is to put a prior on T, but unfortunately the distribution on the latent variables of the model is then a mixture of distributions on spaces of different dimensions, and estimating this mixture distribution by Markov chain Monte Carlo is very difficult. We present a variant of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm that can be used to estimate this mixture distribution, and in particular the posterior distribution of the number of topics. We evaluate our methodology on synthetic data and compare it with procedures that are currently used in the machine learning literature. We also give an illustration on two collections of articles from Wikipedia. Supplemental materials for this article are available online.

ID OLDER-ADULTS; DISEASE; FALLS
AB Gait analysis has traditionally relied on laborious and lab-based methods. Data from wearable sensors, such as Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), can be analyzed with machine learning to perform gait analysis in real-world environments. This database provides data from thirty participants (fifteen males and fifteen females, 23.5 +/- 4.2 years, 169.3 +/- 21.5 cm, 70.9 +/- 13.9 kg) who wore six IMUs while walking on nine outdoor surfaces with self-selected speed (16.4 +/- 4.2 seconds per trial). This is the first publicly available database focused on capturing gait patterns of typical real-world environments, such as grade (up-, down-, and cross-slopes), regularity (paved, uneven stone, grass), and stair negotiation (up and down). As such, the database contains data with only subtle differences between conditions, allowing for the development of robust analysis techniques capable of detecting small, but significant changes in gait mechanics. With analysis code provided, we anticipate that this database will provide a foundation for research that explores machine learning applications for mobile sensing and real-time recognition of subtle gait adaptations.

AB In the data-driven approaches for engineering prognostics, the lack of run-to-fail (RTF) data has been one of the bottlenecks that hinders practical applications in the field. In order to tackle this issue, the dynamic time warping (DTW) method is presented to augment the RTF data obtained from different operating conditions or systems to the current system, which plays the role of virtual RTF data under the current condition. Once the virtual RTF data are available, they are used to train a neural network model to predict the remaining useful life of the current system. When multiple RTF data are available with different behavior under different failure modes, an RMSE-based performance criterion is proposed that can adaptively choose the closest match to the current data and use it as the virtual RTF data during the prognosis process. Numerical examples are given to show that the proposed DTW-based data augmentation can predict the RUL with less uncertainty than the conventional neural network model without data mapping.

TI GENERALIST: A latent space based generative model for protein sequence

SO PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY

DT Article
ID EXPANSION
AB Generative models of protein sequence families are an important tool in the repertoire of protein scientists and engineers alike. However, state-of-the-art generative approaches face inference, accuracy, and overfitting- related obstacles when modeling moderately sized to large proteins and/or protein families with low sequence coverage. Here, we present a simple to learn, tunable, and accurate generative model, GENERALIST: GENERAtive nonLInear tenSor-factorizaTion for protein sequences. GENERALIST accurately captures several high order summary statistics of amino acid covariation. GENERALIST also predicts conservative local optimal sequences which are likely to fold in stable 3D structure. Importantly, unlike current methods, the density of sequences in GENERALIST-modeled sequence ensembles closely resembles the corresponding natural ensembles. Finally, GENERALIST embeds protein sequences in an informative latent space. GENERALIST will be an important tool to study protein sequence variability.
   Protein sequence families show tremendous sequence variation. Yet, it is thought that a large portion of the functional sequence space remains unexplored. Generative models are machine learning methods that allow us to learn what makes proteins functional using sequences of naturally occurring proteins. Here, we present a new type of generative model GENERALIST: GENERAtive nonLInear tenSor-factorizaTion for protein sequences that is accurate, easy to implement, and works with very small datasets. We believe that GENERALIST will be an important tool in the repertoire of protein scientists and engineers alike.

We review evidence that supports the role of continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring in these predictive analytics monitoring tools. In particular, we review how continuous ECG moni-toring reflects the patient and not the clinician, is less likely to be biased, is unaffected by changes in practice patterns, captures signatures of illnesses that are interpretable by clinicians, and is an underappreciated and underutilized source of detailed information for new mathematical methods to reveal.

DE Learning adaptive discriminative correlation filters; Long-term
   tracking; Re-detection
AB Long-term visual tracking undergoes more challenges and is closer to realistic applications than short-term tracking. However, the performances of most existing methods have been limited in the long-term tracking tasks. In this work, we present a reliable yet simple long-term tracking method, which extends the state-of-the-art learning adaptive discriminative correlation filters (LADCF) tracking algorithm with a re-detection component based on the support vector machine (SVM) model. The LADCF tracking algorithm localizes the target in each frame, and the re-detector is able to efficiently re-detect the target in the whole image when the tracking fails. We further introduce a robust confidence degree evaluation criterion that combines the maximum response criterion and the average peak-to-correlation energy (APCE) to judge the confidence level of the predicted target. When the confidence degree is generally high, the SVM is updated accordingly. If the confidence drops sharply, the SVM re-detects the target. We perform extensive experiments on the OTB-2015 and UAV123 datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in long-term tracking.

ID HEALTH; CLASSIFICATION; RECORDS
AB Personal and family history of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (PSH and FSH, respectively) are significant risk factors associated with suicides. Research is limited in automatic identification of such data from clinical notes in Electronic Health Records. This study developed deep learning (DL) tools utilizing transformer models (Bio_ClinicalBERT and GatorTron) to detect PSH and FSH in clinical notes derived from three academic medical centers, and compared their performance with a rule-based natural language processing tool. For detecting PSH, the rule-based approach obtained an F1-score of 0.75 +/- 0.07, while the Bio_ClinicalBERT and GatorTron DL tools scored 0.83 +/- 0.09 and 0.84 +/- 0.07, respectively. For detecting FSH, the rule-based approach achieved an F1-score of 0.69 +/- 0.11, compared to 0.89 +/- 0.10 for Bio_ClinicalBERT and 0.92 +/- 0.07 for GatorTron. Across sites, the DL tools identified more than 80% of patients at elevated risk for suicide who remain undiagnosed and untreated.

AB Recent advances in the biophysics of computation and neurocomputing models have brought to the foreground the importance of dendritic structures in a single neuron cell. Dendritic structures are now viewed as the primary autonomous computational units capable of realizing logical operations. By changing the classic simplified model of a single neuron with a more realistic one that incorporates the dendritic processes, a novel paradigm in artificial neural networks is being established. In this work, we introduce and develop a mathematical model of dendrite computation in a morphological neuron based on lattice algebra. The computational capabilities of this enriched neuron model are demonstrated by means of several illustrative examples and by proving that any single layer morphological perceptron endowed with dendrites and their corresponding input and output synaptic processes is able to approximate any compact region in higher dimensional Euclidean space to within any desired degree of, accuracy. Based on this result, we describe a training algorithm for single layer morphological perceptions and apply it to some well-known nonlinear problems in order to exhibit its performance.

AB Powered by artificial intelligence (AI), chatbots are increasingly capable of simulating human-like conversations. But, is this desirable for strategic communications? Will chatbots be more persuasive if they are more humanlike, not only in their appearance but also in their interaction and delivery of advertising content? We explored these questions with a 2 (chatbot profile: human-like vs. machine-like) x 2 (message interactivity: high vs. low) x 2 (ad type: narrative vs. factual) experiment (N = 414). Data reveal that high message interactivity fosters positive attitudes toward the chatbot and the ad by mitigating violated expectancy. Narrative ads promote chatbot advertising through perceived transportation. A three-way interaction revealed that when a chatbot is machine-like in appearance, higher interactivity and adoption of a narrative style of delivery serve to increase ad persuasiveness by heightening social presence. Theoretical and practical implications for chatbot advertising are discussed.

AB The use of multistep upscaling approaches in which field data are combined with data from multiple remote sensors that operate at different spatial scales (e.g., UAV LiDAR, GEDI, and Landsat) is becoming increasingly popular. In these approaches, a series of models are fitted linking the information from these different sensors, often resulting in improved predictions over large areas. Quantifying the uncertainty associated with individual models can be challenging as these models may not generate uncertainty estimates (e.g., machine learning models such as random forest), a problem that is further exacerbated if the results from multiple models are combined within a multistep upscaling methodology. In this article, we describe a nonparametric conformal approach to quantify uncertainty. This approach is straight-forward to apply, is computationally inexpensive (differently from bootstrapping), and generates improved predictive intervals. Importantly, this methodology can be used regardless of the number of models adopted in the upscaling approach and the nature of the intermediate models, as long as the final model can generate predictive intervals. We illustrate the improved empirical coverage of the conformalized predictive intervals using simulated data for a two-step upscaling scenario involving field, UAV LiDAR, and Landsat data. This simulation exercise shows how increasing uncertainty in the first stage model (which relates biomass field data to UAV LiDAR data) leads to an increase in the severity of uncertainty underestimation by na & iuml;ve predictive intervals. On the other hand, conformalized predictive intervals do not exhibit this shortcoming. Finally, we illustrate uncertainty quantification for a multistep upscaling methodology using data from a large-scale carbon project in the Brazilian Amazon. Our validation exercise using these empirical data confirms the improved performance of the conformalized predictive intervals. We expect that the conformal approach described here will be key for uncertainty quantification as multistep upscaling approaches become increasingly more common.

AB Background: Studies had shown that mortality due to ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is higher in women compared with men. The purpose of this study is to develop and validate prediction models for all-cause in-hospital mortality in women admitted with STEMI using logistic regression and random forest, and to compare the performance and validity of the different models.
   Methods: Data from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) data years 2011-2013 were used to identify women admitted with STEMI. The main outcome was all-cause in-hospital mortality. Patients were divided into development and validation cohorts, and trained models were internally validated using 20% of the 2012 data, and externally validated using 2011 and 2013 NIS data.
   Results: Three main models were developed and compared; multivariate logistic regression, full and reduced random forest models. In the multivariate logistic regression, 11 variables were included in the final model based on backward elimination. The full random forest model contained 32 variables, and the reduced model contained 17 variables selected based on individual variable importance. In the internal validation cohort, the C-index was 0.84, 0.81, and 0.80 for the multivariate logistic regression, full, and reduced random forest models, respectively. The models showed good stability in the external validation cohorts with a C-index for the logistic regression, full, and reduced random forest models of 0.84, 0.85, and 0.81 for year 2011, and 0.82, 0.81, and 0.81 for year 2013, respectively.
   Conclusions: Random forest was comparable to logistic regression in predicting in-hospital mortality in women with STEMI, and can be a useful and accurate tool in clinical practice. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Value Iteration (VI) is a powerful, though time consuming, approach to solve Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Existing algorithms for VI incur a large number of cache misses. Motivated by the observation that, on modern computers, the cost of a cache miss is two to three orders of magnitude more than that of an arithmetic operation, we explore the possibility of improving the performance of VI by reducing the number of cache misses, possibly at the expense of increasing the number of arithmetic operations. Cache efficiency is obtained by performing VI on partitions of the MDP state space that fit in the lowest level cache of the computational platform on which the code is to run. Further performance improvement, motivated by the use of MDP partitions, is obtained using a clustering scheme to construct the partitions and an annealing schedule to converge to the target accuracy. We demonstrate experimentally that incorporating partitioning, clustering, and annealing into state-of-the-art VI software result in speedups of up to a factor of 8.1 on our computational platforms.

TI Classifying early infant feeding status from clinical notes using

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

ID WOMEN; DURATION
AB The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning models to predict infant feeding status from clinical notes in the Epic electronic health records system. The primary outcome was the classification of infant feeding status from clinical notes using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. Annotation of notes was completed using TeamTat to uniquely classify clinical notes according to infant feeding status. We trained 6 machine learning models to classify infant feeding status: logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost gradient descent, k-nearest neighbors, and support-vector classifier. Model comparison was evaluated based on overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Our modeling corpus included an even number of clinical notes that was a balanced sample across each class. We manually reviewed 999 notes that represented 746 mother-infant dyads with a mean gestational age of 38.9 weeks and a mean maternal age of 26.6 years. The most frequent feeding status classification present for this study was exclusive breastfeeding [n=183 (18.3%)], followed by exclusive formula bottle feeding [n=146 (14.6%)], and exclusive feeding of expressed mother's milk [n=102 (10.2%)], with mixed feeding being the least frequent [n=23 (2.3%)]. Our final analysis evaluated the classification of clinical notes as breast, formula/bottle, and missing. The machine learning models were trained on these three classes after performing balancing and down sampling. The XGBoost model outperformed all others by achieving an accuracy of 90.1%, a macro-averaged precision of 90.3%, a macro-averaged recall of 90.1%, and a macro-averaged F1 score of 90.1%. Our results demonstrate that natural language processing can be applied to clinical notes stored in the electronic health records to classify infant feeding status. Early identification of breastfeeding status using NLP on unstructured electronic health records data can be used to inform precision public health interventions focused on improving lactation support for postpartum patients.

ID STREET VIEW; CLASSIFICATION
AB Those who work in the design, development, and management of cities are often limited by the scarcity of data. Particularly in the Global South, urban databases may be insufficient, out of date, or simply not available. However, digital technology is making it possible to fill gaps and build substantial datasets using "urban clues," or attributes, gathered in high-resolution imagery by sky- and street-based cameras. Aided by machine learning, it is possible to detect specific building characteristics (purpose, condition, size, material, and construction)-yielding an array of geolocated details about the built environment. The resulting composite view can be made available, as we have done, in an open-source portal for use in urban management. The insights gained in this way may help address common urban management challenges, such as locating homes vulnerable to hazards such as flooding or earthquakes, identifying urban sprawl and informal housing, prioritizing infrastructure investments, and guiding public program support. This approach has been applied in Colombia, Guatemala, Indonesia, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, St Lucia, and St Maarten.

AB Groundwater irrigation can dramatically affect agricultural production and productivity. Despite its potential as an agricultural development tool, little credible evidence exists for the impacts of groundwater development on smallholder agriculture. We add to the evidence on the benefits of irrigation investments for small producers by evaluating the Rural Business Development (RBD) program of the Millennium Challenge Corporation in Nicaragua for small plantain producers. The RBD program offered matching funds covering up to 30% of the cost of two years of inputs, extension services, and diesel-powered micro-sprinkler irrigation for individual farms. In order to estimate the average impact of the RBD program on its beneficiaries, we combine model selection via the LASSO with doubly robust treatment effect estimation as applied to two years of panel data for 146 producers. We find that the program had substantial impacts on plantain revenue and production, while achieving nearly complete irrigation coverage of plantain land among beneficiaries. We find no discernible impact on household expenditure.

AB Objective: To develop a natural language processing (NLP) package to extract social determinants of health (SDoH) from clinical narratives, examine the bias among race and gender groups, test the generalizability of extracting SDoH for different disease groups, and examine population-level extraction ratio.
   Methods: We developed SDoH corpora using clinical notes identified at the University of Florida (UF) Health. We systematically compared 7 transformer-based large language models (LLMs) and developed an open-source package - SODA (i.e., SOcial DeterminAnts) to facilitate SDoH extraction from clinical narratives. We examined the performance and potential bias of SODA for different race and gender groups, tested the generalizability of SODA using two disease domains including cancer and opioid use, and explored strategies for improvement. We applied SODA to extract 19 categories of SDoH from the breast (n = 7,971), lung (n =11,804), and colorectal cancer (n = 6,240) cohorts to assess patient-level extraction ratio and examine the differences among race and gender groups.
   Results: We developed an SDoH corpus using 629 clinical notes of cancer patients with annotations of 13,193 SDoH concepts/attributes from 19 categories of SDoH, and another cross-disease validation corpus using 200 notes from opioid use patients with 4,342 SDoH concepts/attributes. We compared 7 transformer models and the GatorTron model achieved the best mean average strict/lenient F1 scores of 0.9122 and 0.9367 for SDoH concept extraction and 0.9584 and 0.9593 for linking attributes to SDoH concepts. There is a small performance gap (similar to 4%) between Males and Females, but a large performance gap (>16 %) among race groups. The performance dropped when we applied the cancer SDoH model to the opioid cohort; fine-tuning using a smaller opioid SDoH corpus improved the performance. The extraction ratio varied in the three cancer cohorts, in which 10 SDoH could be extracted from over 70 % of cancer patients, but 9 SDoH could be extracted from less than 70 % of cancer patients. Individuals from the White and Black groups have a higher extraction ratio than other minority race groups.
   Conclusions: Our SODA package achieved good performance in extracting 19 categories of SDoH from clinical narratives. The SODA package with pre-trained transformer models is available at https://github.com/uf-hob i-informatics-lab/SODA_Docker.

AB BackgroundMetagenomic data of whole genome sequences (WGS) from samples across several cities around the globe may unravel city specific signatures of microbes. Illumina MiSeq sequencing data was provided from 12 cities in 7 different countries as part of the 2018 CAMDA MetaSUB Forensic Challenge, including also samples from three mystery sets. We used appropriate machine learning techniques on this massive dataset to effectively identify the geographical provenance of mystery samples. Additionally, we pursued compositional data analysis to develop accurate inferential techniques for such microbiome data. It is expected that this current data, which is of higher quality and higher sequence depth compared to the CAMDA 2017 MetaSUB challenge data, along with improved analytical techniques would yield many more interesting, robust and useful results that can be beneficial for forensic analysis.ResultsA preliminary quality screening of the data revealed a much better dataset in terms of Phred quality score (hereafter Phred score), and larger paired-end MiSeq reads, and a more balanced experimental design, though still not equal number of samples across cities. PCA (Principal Component Analysis) analysis showed interesting clusters of samples and a large amount of the variability in the data was explained by the first three components (similar to 70%). The classification analysis proved to be consistent across both the testing mystery sets with a similar percentage of the samples correctly predicted (up to 90%). The analysis of the relative abundance of bacterial species showed that some species are specific to some regions and can play important roles for predictions. These results were also corroborated by the variable importance given to the species during the internal cross validation (CV) run with Random Forest (RF).ConclusionsThe unsupervised analysis (PCA and two-way heatmaps) of the log2-cpm normalized data and relative abundance differential analysis seemed to suggest that the bacterial signature of common species was distinctive across the cities; which was also supported by the variable importance results. The prediction of the city for mystery sets 1 and 3 showed convincing results with high classification accuracy/consistency. The focus of this work on the current MetaSUB data and the analytical tools utilized here can be of great help in forensic, metagenomics, and other sciences to predict city of provenance of metagenomic samples, as well as in other related fields. Additionally, the pairwise analysis of relative abundance showed that the approach provided consistent and comparable species when compared with the classification importance variables.ReviewersThis article was reviewed by Manuela Oliveira, Dimitar Vassilev, and Patrick Lee.

ID CAUTIONARY NOTE; PREDICTION; QUALITY
AB The estimation of the grapes' maturity in the field using non-destructive techniques is of high interest for the high-valued vinified grapes, particularly towards the development of fully automated agrobots that perform selective harvesting operations. Whereas infrared spectroscopy has been employed using point spectrometers in the laboratory and in the field, imaging spectrometers have mainly been tested in controlled laboratory conditions due to issues with varying illumination. In this paper, the application of the autoencoder framework is proposed, which is employed to transform the raw recorded spectra, regardless of illumination conditions, into standardized reflectance spectra; thus addressing the inherent difficulties which hamper the direct application of hyperspectral imaging in the field. To validate the methodology, the sugar content (degrees Brix) of four grape varieties, namely Chardonnay, Malagouzia, Sauvignon-Blanc, and Syrah, is estimated. Two different autoencoder architectures are examined: deep fully-connected (DAE) and deep convolutional autoencoders (DCAE), while the estimation of sugar content takes place using as input both from the encoded (latent) space and from the autoencoders' output, i.e., the transformed standardized spectra. The use of multiple spectral pre treatments is further examined to enhance the accuracy of prediction. Despite that DAE and DCAE showcase comparable similarity metrics, DCAE statistically outperforms DAE when using both the encoded space and the autoencoders' output, attesting to the suitability of the convolutional autoencoder framework. On the other hand, there is no statistical significant difference when employing multiple input pre-treatments. The accuracy of estimation (mean RMSE 1.83 degrees Brix, R2 0.70, RPIQ 2.43) is comparable to other studies that directly work with standardized reflectance spectra in laboratory conditions.

AB Promising drug development efforts may frequently fail due to unintended adverse reactions. Several methods have been developed to analyze such data, aiming to improve pharmacovigilance and drug safety. In this work, we provide a brief review of key directions to quantitatively analyzing adverse events and explore the potential of augmenting these methods using additional molecular data descriptors. We argue that molecular expansion of adverse event data may provide a path to improving the insights gained through more traditional pharmacovigilance approaches. Examples include the ability to assess statistical relevance with respect to underlying biomolecular mechanisms, the ability to generate plausible causative hypotheses and/or confirmation where possible, the ability to computationally study potential clinical trial designs and/or results, as well as the further provision of advanced features incorporated in innovative methods, such as machine learning. In summary, molecular data expansion provides an elegant way to extend mechanistic modeling, systems pharmacology, and patient-centered approaches for the assessment of drug safety. We anticipate that such advances in real-world data informatics and outcome analytics will help to better inform public health, via the improved ability to prospectively understand and predict various types of drug-induced molecular perturbations and adverse events.

AB Traffic shockwaves demonstrate the formation and spreading of traffic fluctuation on roads. Existing methods mainly detect the shockwaves and their propagation by estimating traffic density and flow, which presents weaknesses in applications when traffic data is only partially or locally collected. This paper proposed a four-step data-driven approach that integrates machine learning with the traffic features to detect shockwaves and estimate their propagation speeds only using partial vehicle trajectory data. Specifically, we first denoise the speed data derived from trajectory data by the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to mitigate the effect of spontaneous random speed fluctuation. Next, we identify trajectory curves' turning points where a vehicle runs into a shockwave and its speed presents a high standard deviation within a short interval. Furthermore, the Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise algorithm (DBSCAN) combined with traffic flow features is adopted to split the turning points into different clusters, each corresponding to a shockwave with constant speed. Last, the one-norm distance regression method is used to estimate the propagation speed of detected shockwaves. The proposed framework was applied to the field data collected from the I-80 and US-101 freeway by the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) program. The results show that this four-step data-driven method could efficiently detect the shockwaves and their propagation speeds without estimating the traffic densities and flows nearby. It performs well for both homogenous and nonhomogeneous road segments with trajectory data collected from total or partial traffic flow.

AB Neural stimulation can be used as a tool to elicit natural sensations or behaviors by modulating neural activity. This can be potentially used to mitigate the damage of brain lesions or neural disorders. However, in order to obtain the optimal stimulation sequences, it is necessary to develop neural control methods, for example by constructing an inverse model of the target system. For real brains, this can be very challenging, and often unfeasible, as it requires repeatedly stimulating the neural system to obtain enough probing data, and depends on an unwarranted assumption of stationarity. By contrast, detailed brain simulations may provide an alternative testbed for understanding the interactions between ongoing neural activity and external stimulation. Unlike real brains, the artificial system can be probed extensively and precisely, and detailed output information is readily available. Here we employed a spiking network model of sensorimotor cortex trained to drive a realistic virtual musculoskeletal arm to reach a target. The network was then perturbed, in order to simulate a lesion, by either silencing neurons or removing synaptic connections. All lesions led to significant behvaioral impairments during the reaching task. The remaining cells were then systematically probed with a set of single and multiple-cell stimulations, and results were used to build an inverse model of the neural system. The inverse model was constructed using a kernel adaptive filtering method, and was used to predict the neural stimulation pattern required to recover the pre-lesion neural activity. Applying the derived neurostimulation to the lesioned network improved the reaching behavior performance. This work proposes a novel neurocontrol method, and provides theoretical groundwork on the use biomimetic brain models to develop and evaluate neurocontrollers that restore the function of damaged brain regions and the corresponding motor behaviors.

ID NEPHROGENIC SYSTEMIC FIBROSIS; GADOLINIUM
AB Background: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an essential part of assessing the extension of resection after craniotomy, allowing for accurate assessment of the brain. However, the application of MRI within 72 h after surgery is limited, owing to its high cost, long time duration, and patients' limited mobility. Besides, MRI excludes people with contraindications, in which sceneries computerized tomography (CT) is the only available choice. To overcome these limitations, we investigated the use of a deep learning model for synthesizing postoperative MRI images. Methods: We employed Cross-domain Correspondence Learning for Exemplar-based Image Translation Network (CoCosNet), an exemplar-based image translation model to synthesize T1 contrast-enhanced (T1ce) MRI images by combining post-operative T1ce and post-operative CT images. 233 cases were retrospectively collected at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center and underwent complete MRI and CT scans. Results: After 200 epochs and a batch size of 10, CoCosNet achieved comparable results compared to other existing models, with objective indicators structural similarity index = 0.75, peak signal to noise ratio = 21.68, and mean absolute error = 0.007. Furthermore, assessments of the extension of resection between the true and synthesized T1ce images achieve great consistency. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of the CoCosNet model in synthesizing post-operative MRI images from pre-operative MRI and post-operative CT scans. Quantitative analysis indicates that the synthesized images have comparable quality to real MRI images and can accurately discriminate the extent of resection. This approach has a promising future by providing a reliable alternative to traditional post-operative MRI.

TI Developing and validating a machine-learning algorithm to predict opioid

ID RISK
AB Background Little is known about whether machine-learning algorithms developed to predict opioid overdose using earlier years and from a single state will perform as well when applied to other populations. We aimed to develop a machine-learning algorithm to predict 3-month risk of opioid overdose using Pennsylvania Medicaid data and externally validated it in two data sources (ie, later years of Pennsylvania Medicaid data and data from a different state).
   Methods This prognostic modelling study developed and validated a machine-learning algorithm to predict overdose in Medicaid beneficiaries with one or more opioid prescription in Pennsylvania and Arizona, USA. To predict risk of hospital or emergency department visits for overdose in the subsequent 3 months, we measured 284 potential predictors from pharmaceutical and health-care encounter claims data in 3-month periods, starting 3 months before the first opioid prescription and continuing until loss to follow-up or study end. We developed and internally validated a gradient-boosting machine algorithm to predict overdose using 2013-16 Pennsylvania Medicaid data (n=639 693). We externally validated the model using (1) 2017-18 Pennsylvania Medicaid data (n=318585) and (2) 2015-17 Arizona Medicaid data (n=391959). We reported several prediction performance metrics (eg, C-statistic, positive predictive value). Beneficiaries were stratified into risk-score subgroups to support clinical use.
   Findings A total of 8641 (1.35%) 2013-16 Pennsylvania Medicaid beneficiaries, 2705 (0.85%) 2017-18 Pennsylvania Medicaid beneficiaries, and 2410 (0.61%) 2015-17 Arizona beneficiaries had one or more overdose during the study period. C-statistics for the algorithm predicting 3-month overdoses developed from the 2013-16 Pennsylvania training dataset and validated on the 2013-16 Pennsylvania internal validation dataset, 2017-18 Pennsylvania external validation dataset, and 2015-17 Arizona external validation dataset were 0.841 (95% CI 0.835-0.847), 0.828 (0 822-0. 834), and 0.817 (0. 807-0 826), respectively. In external validation datasets, 71361(22.4%) of 318 585 2017-18 Pennsylvania beneficiaries were in high-risk subgroups (positive predictive value of 0.38-4.08%; capturing 73% of overdoses in the subsequent 3 months) and 40 041 (10%) of 391959 2015-17 Arizona beneficiaries were in high-risk subgroups (positive predictive value of 0.19-1.97%; capturing 55% of overdoses). Lower risk subgroups in both validation data sets had few individuals (<= 0.2%) with an overdose.
   Interpretation A machine-learning algorithm predicting opioid overdose derived from Pennsylvania Medicaid data performed well in external validation with more recent Pennsylvania data and with Arizona Medicaid data.

AB Computation in. a neuron of a traditional neural network is accomplished by summing the products of neural values and connection weights of all the neurons in the network connected to it. The new state of the neuron is then obtained by an activation function which sets the state to either zero or one, depending on the computed value. We provide an alternative way of computation in an artificial neuron based on lattice algebra and dendritic computation. The neurons of the proposed model bear a close resemblance to the morphology of biological neurons and mimic some of their behavior. The computational and pattern recognition capabilities of this model are explored by means of illustrative examples and detailed discussion.

AB As powerful computational tools and 'big data' transform the biological sciences, bioinformatics training is becoming necessary to prepare the next generation of life scientists. Furthermore, because the tools and resources employed in bioinformatics are constantly evolving, bioinformatics learning materials must be continuously improved. In addition, these learning materials need to move beyond today's typical step-by-step guides to promote deeper conceptual understanding by students. One of the goals of the Network for Integrating Bioinformatics into Life Sciences Education (NIBSLE) is to create, curate, disseminate, and assess appropriate open-access bioinformatics learning resources. Here we describe the evolution, integration, and assessment of a learning resource that explores essential concepts of biological sequence similarity. Pre/post student assessment data from diverse life science courses show significant learning gains. These results indicate that the learning resource is a beneficial educational product for the integration of bioinformatics across curricula.

AB In practical manufacturing systems, the job processing time usually varies with the performance change of manufacturing resources, among which the learning and deteriorating effects are typical characteristics. Due to the interests from both academic exploration and industrial innovation, the research on scheduling problems with these effects is abundant and diverse. However, some studied problems need to be strengthened in combination with realistic production scenarios. This paper provides a concise guide to scheduling problems with these effects, giving a comprehensive review and critical hints for future research. A novel classification scheme is designed based on four levels of different domains, i.e. effects, processing ways, processing time functions, and manufacturing environments. Based on this scheme, the scheduling problems are first distinguished into three categories: learning effects, deteriorating effects, and combined effects. In each category, models are then refined along three lines: general processing way, batch scheduling, and group scheduling. Combined with the attributes of actual processing time functions and manufacturing environments, the evolvement of related scheduling models and a critical analysis on the proposed algorithms are well analysed. Afterwards, the research gaps are revealed and the research directions are indicated from the perspectives of practical applications, time functions, and designed algorithms.

ID CHILDRENS ONCOLOGY GROUP; CLASSIFICATION-SYSTEM
AB PURPOSE Metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scans are a radionucleotide imaging modality that undergo Curie scoring to semiquantitatively assess neuroblastoma burden, which can be used as a marker of therapy response. We hypothesized that a convolutional neural network (CNN) could be developed that uses diagnostic MIBG scans to predict response to induction chemotherapy.
   METHODS We analyzed MIBG scans housed in the International Neuroblastoma Risk Group Data Commons from patients enrolled in the Children's Oncology Group high-risk neuroblastoma study ANBL12P1. The primary outcome was response to upfront chemotherapy, defined as a Curie score <= 2 after four cycles of induction chemotherapy. We derived and validated a CNN using two-dimensional whole-body MIBG scans from diagnosis and evaluated model performance using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). We also developed a clinical classification model to predict response on the basis of age, stage, and MYCN amplification.
   RESULTS Among 103 patients with high-risk neuroblastoma included in the final cohort, 67 (65%) were responders. Performance in predicting response to upfront chemotherapy was equivalent using the CNN and the clinical model. Class-activation heatmaps verified that the CNN used areas of disease within the MIBG scans to make predictions. Furthermore, integrating predictions using a geometric mean approach improved detection of responders to upfront chemotherapy (geometric mean AUC 0.73 v CNN AUC 0.63, P <.05; v clinical model AUC 0.65, P <.05).
   CONCLUSION We demonstrate feasibility in using machine learning of diagnostic MIBG scans to predict response to induction chemotherapy for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma. We highlight improvements when clinical risk factors are also integrated, laying the foundation for using a multimodal approach to guiding treatment decisions for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.

AB Electric vehicles (EVs) are considered an environmentally friendly option compared to conventional vehicles. As the most critical module in EVs, batteries are complex electrochemical components with nonlinear behavior. On-board battery system performance is also affected by complicated operating environments. Real-time EV battery in-service status prediction is tricky but vital to enable fault diagnosis and prevent dangerous occurrences. Data-driven models with advantages in time-series analysis can be used to capture the degradation pattern from data about certain performance indicators and predict the battery states. The transformer model can capture long-range dependencies efficiently using a multi-head attention block mechanism. This paper presents the implementation of a standard transformer and an encoder-only transformer neural network to predict EV battery state of health (SOH). Based on the analysis of the lithium-ion battery from the NASA Prognostics Center of Excellence website's publicly accessible dataset, 28 features related to the charge and discharge measurement data are extracted. The features are screened using Pearson correlation coefficients. The results show that the filtered features can improve the model's accuracy and computational efficiency. The proposed standard transformer shows good performance in the SOH prediction.

ID DIVERGENCE; ALGORITHM; SYSTEMS
AB Recurrent neural network (RNN) has emerged as a promising tool in modeling nonlinear dynamical systems, but the training convergence is still of concern. This paper aims to develop an effective extended Kalman filter-based RNN training approach with a controllable training convergence. The training convergence problem during extended Kalman filter-based RNN training has been proposed and studied by adapting two artificial training noise parameters: the covariance of measurement noise (R) and the covariance of process noise (Q) of Kalman filter. The R and Q adaption laws have been developed using the Lyapunov method and the maximum likelihood method, respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed adaption laws has been tested using a nonlinear dynamical benchmark system and further applied in cutting tool wear modeling. The results show that the R adaption law can effectively avoid the divergence problem and ensure the training convergence, whereas the Q adaption law helps improve the training convergence speed.

AB To sequester particulate matter (PM) and chemical loads, stormwater basins are a common infrastructure component of transportation land use systems in a planning/design or a retrofit phase. Basin design relies on residence time (RT), capacity-inflow ratio (CIR), and continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) concepts to provide presumptive guidance for load reduction. For example, 14-day (or 21-day) RT is presumed to provide load reduction for total suspended solids (TSS) (e.g., commonly 80%), and for total phosphorus (TP) (e.g., commonly 60%). Despite such guidance, most existing basins are impaired-not meeting presumptive guidance, whether for TSS, nutrients, or chemicals (e.g., metals). RT guidance results in high initial basin design costs (land and construction). For impaired basin retrofit, RT guidance generates a significantly higher cost (area/volume increase), if such a retrofit is even feasible considering proximate infrastructure constraints. This study presents a computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-machine learning (ML) augmented web application, DeepXtorm, for cost-benefit optimization of basin design and retrofit. DeepXtorm is examined against basin costs from as-built data, RT, CIR, and CSTR (deployed in the Storm Water Management Model [SWMM]) over a range of load reduction levels of TSS (60%-90%) and TP (40%-60%). For a given load reduction requirement, DeepXtorm demonstrates up to an order of magnitude (or more) lower basin cost compared with RT, CIR, and CSTR models, and greater than an order of magnitude compared with as-built cost data. DeepXtorm represents a more robust and cost-effective tool for stormwater basin design and retrofit.

AB Electric vehicles (EVs) have emerged as an environmentally friendly alternative to conventional fuel vehicles. Lithium-ion batteries are the major energy source for EVs, but they degrade under dynamic operating conditions. Accurate estimation of battery state of health is important for sustainability as it quantifies battery condition, influences reuse possibilities, and helps alleviate capacity degradation, which finally impacts battery lifespan and energy efficiency. In this paper, a self-attention graph neural network combined with long short-term memory (LSTM) is introduced by focusing on using temporal and spatial dependencies in battery data. The LSTM layer utilizes a sliding window to extract temporal dependencies in the battery health factors. Two different approaches to the graph construction layer are subsequently developed: health factor-based and window-based graphs. Each approach emphasizes the interconnections between individual health factors and exploits temporal features in a deeper way, respectively. The self-attention mechanism is used to compute the adjacent weight matrix, which measures the strength of interactions between nodes in the graph. The impact of the two graph structures on the model performance is discussed. The model accuracy and computational cost of the proposed model are compared with the individual LSTM and gated recurrent unit (GRU) models.

AB BackgroundNowadays, trendy research in biomedical sciences juxtaposes the term precision' to medicine and public health with companion words like big data, data science, and deep learning. Technological advancements permit the collection and merging of large heterogeneous datasets from different sources, from genome sequences to social media posts or from electronic health records to wearables. Additionally, complex algorithms supported by high-performance computing allow one to transform these large datasets into knowledge. Despite such progress, many barriers still exist against achieving precision medicine and precision public health interventions for the benefit of the individual and the population.Main bodyThe present work focuses on analyzing both the technical and societal hurdles related to the development of prediction models of health risks, diagnoses and outcomes from integrated biomedical databases. Methodological challenges that need to be addressed include improving semantics of study designs: medical record data are inherently biased, and even the most advanced deep learning's denoising autoencoders cannot overcome the bias if not handled a priori by design. Societal challenges to face include evaluation of ethically actionable risk factors at the individual and population level; for instance, usage of gender, race, or ethnicity as risk modifiers, not as biological variables, could be replaced by modifiable environmental proxies such as lifestyle and dietary habits, household income, or access to educational resources.ConclusionsData science for precision medicine and public health warrants an informatics-oriented formalization of the study design and interoperability throughout all levels of the knowledge inference process, from the research semantics, to model development, and ultimately to implementation.

AB A new global optimization strategy for training adaptive systems such as neural networks and adaptive filters [finite or infinite impulse response (FIR or IIR)] is proposed in this paper. Instead of adding random noise to the weights as proposed in the past, additive random noise is injected directly into the desired signal. Experimental results show that this procedure also speeds up greatly the backpropagation algorithm. The method is very easy to implement in practice, preserving the backpropagation algorithm and requiring a single random generator with a monotonically decreasing step size per output channel. Hence, this is an ideal strategy to speed up supervised learning, and avoid local minima entrapment when the noise variance is appropriately scheduled.

AB This study compared five different methods for analyzing accelerometer-measured physical activity (PA) in older adults and assessed the relationship between changes in PA and changes in physical function and depressive symptoms for each method. Older adult females (N = 144, M-age = 83.3 +/- 6.4yrs) wore hip accelerometers for six days and completed measures of physical function and depressive symptoms at baseline and six months. Accelerometry data were processed by five methods to estimate PA: 1041 vertical axis cut-point, 15-second vector magnitude (VM) cut-point, 1-second VM algorithm (Activity Index (AI)), machine learned walking algorithm, and individualized cut-point derived from a 400-meter walk. Generalized estimating equations compared PA minutes across methods and showed significant differences between some methods but not others; methods estimated 6-month changes in PA ranging from 4 minutes to over 20 minutes. Linear mixed models for each method tested associations between changes in PA and health. All methods, except the individualized cut-point, had a significant relationship between change in PA and improved physical function and depressive symptoms. This study is among the first to compare accelerometry processing methods and their relationship to health. It is important to recognize the differences in PA estimates and relationship to health outcomes based on data processing method.

AB In vitro neural networks of cortical neurons interfaced to a computer via multichannel microelectrocle arrays (MEA) provide a unique paradigm to create a hybrid neural computer. Unfortunately, only rudimentary information about these in vitro network's computational properties or the extent of their abilities are known. To study those properties, a liquid state machine (LSM) approach was employed in which the liquid (typically an artificial neural network) was replaced with a living cortical network and the input and readout functions were replaced by the MEA-computer interface. A key requirement of the LSM architecture is that inputs into the liquid state must result in separable outputs based on the liquid's response (separation property). In this paper, high and low frequency multi-site stimulation patterns were applied to the living cortical networks. Two template-based classifiers, one based on Euclidean distance and a second based on a cross-correlation were then applied to measure the separation of the input-output relationship. The result was over a 95% (99.8% when nonstationarity is compensated) input reconstruction accuracy for the high and low frequency patterns, confirming the existence of the separation property in these biological networks.

AB This contribution presents a new method of analyzing the dynamics of a biological relevant neural network with different time scales based on the theory of flow invariance. We are able to show that the resulting stability conditions are less restrictive and more general than with K-monotone theory or singular perturbation theory. The theoretical results are further substantiated by simulation results conducted for analysis and design of these neural networks. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

SO AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY

DT Article
DE recidivism; artificial intelligence; criminal justice; racial bias;
   disparate treatment
ID AFFIRMATIVE-ACTION
AB Recent studies have shown that recidivism scoring algorithms like COMPAS have significant racial bias: Black defendants are roughly twice as likely as white defendants to be mis-takenly classified as medium-or high -risk. This has led some to call for abolishing COMPAS. But many others have argued that algorithms should instead be given access to a defendant's race, which, perhaps counterintuitively, is likely to improve outcomes. This approach can involve either estab-lishing race-sensitive risk thresholds, or distinct racial `tracks'. Is there a moral difference between these two approaches? We first consider Deborah Hellman's view that the use of distinct racial tracks (but not distinct thresholds) does not constitute disparate treatment since the effects on individuals are indirect and does not rely on a racial generalization. We argue that this is mistaken: the use of different racial tracks seems both to have direct effects on and to rely on a racial generalization. We then offer an alternative understanding of the distinction between these two approaches-namely, that the use of different cut points is to the counterfactual comparative disadvantage, ex ante, of all white defendants, while the use of different racial tracks can in principle be to the advantage of all groups, though some defendants in both groups will fare worse. Does this mean that the use of cut points is impermissible? Ultimately, we argue, while there are reasons to be skeptical of the use of distinct cut points, it is an open question whether these reasons suffice to make a difference to their moral permissibility.

AB Purpose - The paper's aims is to present research that evaluates a technology that assists in organizing and retrieving knowledge stored in a variety of forms (books, papers, models, decision support systems, databases) through a real world application.
   Design/methodology/approach - Ontology has been used to manage the Water Conservation Digital Library in Florida, USA, which holds a dynamic collection of various types of digital resources in the domain of urban water conservation. The ontology based back-end powers a fully operational web interface, available at: http://library.conservefloridawater.org
   Findings - The system has demonstrated numerous benefits of the ontology application, including easier and more precise finding of resources, information sharing and reuse, and has proved to effectively facilitate information management.
   Research limitations/implications - A large and dynamic number of concepts makes it difficult to keep the ontology consistent and to accurately manually catalog resources. To address these issues, ongoing research focuses on the area of information extraction with the aid of natural language processing techniques.
   Originality/value - The paper presents a real-world-verified application of ontology to a digital library. It may be of potential interest for anyone who needs to effectively manage a collection of digital resources.

ID SELECTION
AB As our ability to sense increases, we are experiencing a transition from data-poor problems, in which the central issue is a lack of relevant data, to data-rich problems, in which the central issue is to identify a few relevant features in a sea of observations. Motivated by applications in gravitational-wave astrophysics, we study a problem in which the goal is to predict the presence of transient noise artifacts in a gravitationalwave detector from a rich collection of measurements from the detector and its environment. We argue that feature learning-in which relevant features are optimized from data-is critical to achieving high accuracy. We introduce models that reduce the error rate by over 60% compared to the previous state of the art, which used fixed, hand-crafted features. Feature learning is useful not only because it can improve performance on prediction tasks; the results provide valuable information about patterns associated with phenomena of interest that would otherwise be impossible to discover. In our motivating application, features found to be associated with transient noise provide diagnostic information about its origin and suggest mitigation strategies. Learning in such a high-dimensional setting is challenging. Through experiments with a variety of architectures, we identify two key factors in high-performing models: sparsity, for selecting relevant variables within the high-dimensional observations, and depth, which confers flexibility for handling complex interactions and robustness with respect to temporal variations. We illustrate their significance through a systematic series of experiments on real gravitational-wave detector data. Our results provide experimental corroboration of common assumptions in the machine-learning community and have direct applicability to improving our ability to sense gravitational waves, as well as to a wide variety of problem settings with similarly high-dimensional, noisy, or partly irrelevant data.

AB Peptide-based drugs offer high specificity, potency, and selectivity. However, their inherent flexibility and differences in conformational preferences between their free and bound states create unique challenges that have hindered progress in effective drug discovery pipelines. The emergence of AlphaFold (AF) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents new opportunities for enhancing peptide-based drug discovery. We explore recent advancements that facilitate a successful peptide drug discovery pipeline, considering peptides' attractive therapeutic properties and strategies to enhance their stability and bioavailability. AF enables efficient and accurate prediction of peptide-protein structures, addressing a critical requirement in computational drug discovery pipelines. In the post-AF era, we are witnessing rapid progress with the potential to revolutionize peptide-based drug discovery such as the ability to rank peptide binders or classify them as binders/non-binders and the ability to design novel peptide sequences. However, AI-based methods are struggling due to the lack of well-curated datasets, for example to accommodate modified amino acids or unconventional cyclization. Thus, physics-based methods, such as docking or molecular dynamics simulations, continue to hold a complementary role in peptide drug discovery pipelines. Moreover, MD-based tools offer valuable insights into binding mechanisms, as well as the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of complexes. As we navigate this evolving landscape, a synergistic integration of AI and physics-based methods holds the promise of reshaping the landscape of peptide-based drug discovery.This article is categorized under:Structure and Mechanism > Computational Biochemistry and BiophysicsMolecular and Statistical Mechanics > Molecular InteractionsSoftware > Molecular Modeling

AB ObjectivesTo identify mechanisms underpinning the complex relationships between influential factors and suicide risk with psychological autopsy data and machine learning method. DesignA case-control study with suicide deaths selected using two-stage stratified cluster sampling method; and 1:1 age-and-gender matched live controls in the same geographic area. SettingDisproportionately high risk of suicide among rural elderly in China. ParticipantsA total of 242 subjects died from suicide and 242 matched live controls, 60 years of age and older. MeasurementsSuicide death was determined based on the ICD-10 codes. Influential factors were measured using validated instruments and commonly accepted variables. ResultsOf the total sample, 270 (55.8%) were male with mean age = 74.2 (SD = 8.2) years old. Four CART models were used to select influential factors using the criteria: areas under the curve (AUC) >= 0.8, sensitivity >= 0.8, and specificity >= 0.8. Each model included a lead predictor plus 8-10 hierarchically nested factors. Depression was the first to be selected in Model 1 as the lead predictor; After depression was excluded, quality of life (QOL) was selected in Model 2; After depression and QOL were excluded, social support was selected in Model 3. Finally, after all 3 lead factors were excluded, marital status was selected in Model 4. In addition, CART demonstrated the significance of several influential factors that would not be associated with suicide if the data were analyzed using the conventional logistic regression. ConclusionAssociations between the key factors and suicide death for Chinese rural elderly are not linear and parallel but hierarchically nested that could not be effectively detected using conventional statistical methods. Findings of this study provide new and compelling evidence supporting tailored suicide prevention interventions at the familial, clinical and community levels.

AB In this paper, we discuss some equivalences between two recently introduced statistical learning schemes, namely Mercer kernel methods and information theoretic methods. We show that Parzen window-based estimators for some information theoretic cost functions are also cost functions in a corresponding Mercer kernel space. The Mercer kernel is directly related to the Parzen window. Furthermore, we analyze a classification rule based on an information theoretic criterion, and show that this corresponds to a linear classifier in the kernel space. By introducing a weighted Parzen window density estimator, we also formulate the support vector machine in this information theoretic perspective.

ID SITUATION AWARENESS
AB Operation and Maintenance (O&M) missions are often time-sensitive and accuracy-dependent, requiring rapid and precise information processing in noisy, chaotic environments where oral communication can lead to cognitive overload and impaired decision-making. Augmented Reality (AR) and Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential for enhancing situational awareness and lowering cognitive load by integrating digital visualizations with the physical world and improving dialogue management. However, synthesizing these technologies into a real-time system that effectively aids operators remains a challenge. This study explores the integration of AR and GPT-4, an advanced LLM, in time-sensitive O&M tasks, aiming to enhance situational awareness and manage cognitive load during oral communications. A customized AR system, incorporating the Microsoft HoloLens2 for cognitive monitoring and GPT-4 for decision making assistance, was tested in a human subject experiment with 30 participants. The 2x2 factorial experiment evaluated the effects of AR and LLM assistance on task performance and cognitive load. Results demonstrated significant improvements in task accuracy and reductions in cognitive load, highlighting the effectiveness of AR and LLM integration in supporting O&M missions. These findings emphasize the need for further research to optimize operational strategies in mission critical environments.

ID SUPPORT VECTOR
AB Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have been extensively used because of their lower nonrecurring engineering and design costs, instant availability and reduced visibility of failure, high performance, and power benefits. Reports indicate that previously used or recycled FPGAs are infiltrating the electronics' supply chain and making the security and reliability of the critical systems and networks vulnerable. Current recycled integrated circuit (IC) detection procedures include parametric, functional, and burn-in tests that require golden or reference data. Besides, they are time consuming, require expensive equipment, and do not focus on FPGAs. In this article, we propose two recycled FPGA detection methods based on supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms. We develop a sophisticated ring oscillator (RO) design to exploit the degradation of lookup tables (LUTs) and use them in the proposed methods. In the supervised method, a one-class classifier is trained with RO frequencies, kurtosis, and skewness data obtained from unused FPGAs, which differentiates unused and aged FPGAs. The unsupervised method uses k-means clustering and Silhouette value analysis to detect suspect recycled components with very little (if any) golden information. In addition, we introduce a voltage scaling-assisted RO frequency measurement technique that improves the classification. The proposed methods are examined for Spartan-3A and Spartan-6 FPGAs, and the result shows that both methods are effective in detecting recycled FPGAs, which experience accelerated aging for at least 12 h equivalent to 70 days in real-time age.

LA English
DT Article
DE Hardware security; machine learning
AB Growth of the Internet-of-things has led to complex system-on-chips (SoCs) being used in the edge devices in IoT applications. The increased complexity is demanding designers to consider several critical factors, such as dynamic requirement changes, long application life, mass production, and tight time-to-market deadlines. These requirements lead to more complex security concerns. SoC manufacturers outsource some of the intellectual property cores integrated on the SoC to untrusted third-party vendors. The untrusted intellectual properties can contain malicious implants, which can launch attacks using the resources provided by the on-chip interconnection network, commonly known as the network-on-chip (NoC). Existing efforts on securing NoC have considered lightweight encryption, authentication, and other attack detection mechanisms such as denial-of-service and buffer overflows. Unfortunately, these approaches focus on designing statically optimized security solutions. As a result, they are not suitable for many IoT systems with long application life and dynamic requirement changes. There is a critical need to design reconfigurable security architectures that can be dynamically tuned based on changing requirements. In this article, we propose a tier-based reconfigurable security architecture that can adapt to different use-case scenarios. We explore how to design an efficient reconfigurable architecture that can support three popular NoC security mechanisms (encryption, authentication, and denial-of-service attack detection and localization) and implement suitable dynamic reconfiguration techniques. We evaluate our proposed framework by running standard benchmarks enabling different tiers of security and provide a comprehensive analysis of how different levels of security can affect application performance, energy efficiency, and area overhead.

AB Normalized crop canopy temperature, termed crop water stress index (CWSI), was proposed over 40 years ago as an irrigation management tool but has experienced limited adoption in production agriculture. Development of generalized crop-specific upper and lower reference temperatures is critical for implementation of CWSI-based irrigation scheduling. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate data-driven models for predicting the reference canopy temperatures needed to compute CWSI for sugarbeet and wine grape. Reference canopy temperatures for sugarbeet and wine grape were predicted using machine learning and regression models developed from measured canopy temperatures of sugarbeet, grown in Idaho and Wyoming, and wine grape, grown in Idaho and Oregon, over five years under full and severe deficit irrigation. Lower reference temperatures (TLL) were estimated using neural network models with Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiencies exceeding 0.88 and root mean square error less than 1.1 degrees C. The relationship between TLL minus ambient air temperature and vapor pressure deficit was represented with a linear model that maximized the regression coefficient rather than minimized the sum of squared error. The linear models were used to estimate upper reference temperatures that were nearly double the values reported in previous studies. A daily CWSI, calculated as the average of 15 min CWSI values between 13:00 and 16:00 MDT for sugarbeet and between 13:00 and 15:00 local time for wine grape, were well correlated with irrigation events and amounts. There was a significant (p < 0.001) linear relationship between the daily CWSI and midday leaf water potential of Malbec and Syrah wine grapes, with an R-2 of 0.53. The data-driven models developed in this study to estimate reference temperatures enable automated calculation of the CWSI for effective assessment of crop water stress. However, measurements taken under conditions of wet canopy or low solar radiation should be disregarded as they can result in irrational values of the CWSI.

AB Actigraphy has attracted much attention for assessing physical activity in the past decade. Many algorithms have been developed to automate the analysis process, but none has targeted a general model to discover related features for detecting or predicting mobility function, or more specifically, mobility impairment and major mobility disability (MMD). Men (N = 357) and women (N = 778) aged 70-89 years wore a tri-axial accelerometer (Actigraph GT3X) on the right hip during free-living conditions for 8.4 +/- 3.0 d. One-second epoch data were summarized into 67 features. Several machine learning techniques were used to select features from the free-living condition to predict mobility impairment, defined as 400 m walking speed <0.80 m s(-1). Selected features were also included in a model to predict the first occurrence of MMD-defined as the loss in the ability to walk 400 m. Each method yielded a similar estimate of 400 m walking speed with a root mean square error of similar to 0.07 m s(-1) and an R-squared values ranging from 0.37-0.41. Sensitivity and specificity of identifying slow walkers was approximately 70% and 80% for all methods, respectively. The top five features, which were related to movement pace and amount (activity counts and steps), length in activity engagement (bout length), accumulation patterns of activity, and movement variability significantly improved the prediction of MMD beyond that found with common covariates (age, diseases, anthropometry, etc). This study identified a subset of actigraphy features collected in free-living conditions that are moderately accurate in identifying persons with clinically-assessed mobility impaired and significantly improve the prediction of MMD. These findings suggest that the combination of features as opposed to a specific feature is important to consider when choosing features and/or combinations of features for prediction of mobility phenotypes in older adults.

AB T cell receptors (TCR) play a vital role in the immune system's ability to recognize and respond to foreign antigens, relying on the highly polymorphic rearrangement of TCR genes. The recognition of autologous peptides by adaptive immunity may lead to the development and progression of autoimmune diseases. Understanding the specific TCR involved in this process can provide insights into the autoimmune process. RNA-seq (RNA sequencing) is a valuable tool for studying TCR repertoires by providing a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of the RNA transcripts. With the development of RNA technology, transcriptomic data must provide valuable information to model and predict TCR and antigen interaction and, more importantly, identify or predict neoantigens. This review provides an overview of the application and development of bulk RNA-seq and single-cell (SC) RNA-seq to examine the TCR repertoires. Furthermore, discussed here are bioinformatic tools that can be applied to study the structural biology of peptide/TCR/MHC (major histocompatibility complex) and predict antigenic epitopes using advanced artificial intelligence tools.

Electrode implantation surgery, referred to as deep brain stimulation (DBS), is preferred to ablative procedures by many experts owing to its reversibility, programmability, and the ability to be safely performed bilaterally. Several randomized clinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of DBS surgery for control of PD symptoms. Many brain targets, including the subthalamic nucleus and the globus pallidus internus, have emerged as potentially effective, with each target being closely associated with important pros and cons. Selection of appropriate PD candidates through a methodical interdisciplinary screening is considered a prerequisite for a successful surgical outcome. Despite recent growth in DBS knowledge, there is currently no consensus on the ideal surgical technique, the best surgical approach, and the most appropriate surgical target. DBS is now targeted towards treating specific PD-related symptoms in a given individual, and not simply addressing the disease with one pre-defined approach. In this review we will discuss the historical aspects of surgical treatments, the selection of an appropriate DBS candidate, the current surgical techniques, and recently introduced DBS-related technologies. We will address important pre-and postoperative issues related to DBS. We will also discuss the lessons learned from the randomized clinical studies for DBS and the shifting paradigm to tailor to a more patient-centered and symptom-specific approach.

AB Substantial efforts have been made for local administration of small molecules or biologics in treating hearing loss diseases caused by either trauma, genetic mutations, or drug ototoxicity. Recently, extracellular vesicles (EVs) naturally secreted from cells have drawn increasing attention on attenuating hearing impairment from both preclinical studies and clinical studies. Highly emerging field utilizing diverse bioengineering technologies for developing EVs as the bioderived therapeutic materials, along with artificial intelligence (AI) -based targeting toolkits, shed the light on the unique properties of EVs specific to inner ear delivery. This review will illuminate such exciting research field from fundamentals of hearing protective functions of EVs to biotechnology advancement and potential clinical translation of functionalized EVs. Specifically, the advancements in assessing targeting ligands using AI algorithms are systematically discussed. The overall translational potential of EVs is reviewed in the context of auditory sensing system for developing next generation gene therapy.

AB Technology has advanced to where it is possible to design and grow-with predefined geometry and surprisingly good fidelity-living networks of neurons in culture dishes. Here we overview the elements of design, emphasizing the lithographic techniques that alter the cell culture surface which in turn influences the attachment and growth of the neural networks. Advanced capability in this area makes it possible to design networks of desired complexity. Other issues addressed include the influence of glial cells and media on activity and the potential for extending the designs into three dimensions. Investigators are advancing the art and science of analyzing and controlling through stimulation the function of the neural networks, including the ability to take advantage of their geometric form in order to influence functional properties.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Steady increases in healthcare costs and obesity have inspired recent studies into cost-effective, assistive systems capable of monitoring dietary habits. Few researchers, though, have investigated the use of video as a means of monitoring dietary activities. Video possesses several inherent qualities, such as passive acquisition, that merits its analysis as an input modality for such an application. To this end, we propose a method to automatically detect chewing events in surveillance video of a subject. Firstly, an Active Appearance Model (AAM) is used to track a subject's face across the video sequence. It is observed that the variations in the AAM parameters across chewing events demonstrate a distinct periodicity. We utilize this property to discriminate between chewing and non-chewing facial actions such as talking. A feature representation is constructed by applying spectral analysis to a temporal window of model parameter values. The estimated power spectra subsequently undergo non-linear dimensionality reduction. The low-dimensional embedding of the power spectra are employed to train a binary Support Vector Machine classifier to detect chewing events. To emulate the gradual onset and offset of chewing, smoothness is imposed over the class predictions of neighboring video frames in order to deter abrupt changes in the class labels. Experiments are conducted on a dataset consisting of 37 subjects performing each of five actions, namely, open- and closed-mouth chewing, clutter faces, talking, and still face. Experimental results yielded a cross-validated percentage agreement of 93.0%, indicating that the proposed system provides an efficient approach to automated chewing detection.

TI CIS-UNet: Multi-class segmentation of the aorta in computed tomography

DT Article
DE Aorta segmentation; Computed tomography; Context infused swin-UNet;
   Shifted window self-attention
AB Advancements in medical imaging and endovascular grafting have facilitated minimally invasive treatments for aortic diseases. Accurate 3D segmentation of the aorta and its branches is crucial for interventions, as inaccurate segmentation can lead to erroneous surgical planning and endograft construction. Previous methods simplified aortic segmentation as a binary image segmentation problem, overlooking the necessity of distinguishing between individual aortic branches. In this paper, we introduce Context-Infused Swin-UNet (CISUNet), a deep learning model designed for multi-class segmentation of the aorta and thirteen aortic branches. Combining the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Swin transformers, CIS-UNet adopts a hierarchical encoder-decoder structure comprising a CNN encoder, asymmetric decoder, skip connections, and a novel Context-aware Shifted Window Self-Attention (CSW-SA) module as the bottleneck block. Notably, CSW-SA introduces a unique adaptation of the patch merging layer, distinct from its traditional use in the Swin transformers. CSW-SA efficiently condenses the feature map, providing a global spatial context, and enhances performance when applied at the bottleneck layer, offering superior computational efficiency and segmentation accuracy compared to the Swin transformers. We evaluated our model on computed tomography (CT) scans from 59 patients through a 4-fold cross-validation. CIS-UNet outperformed the state-of-the-art Swin UNetR segmentation model by achieving a superior mean Dice coefficient of 0.732 compared to 0.717 and a mean surface distance of 2.40 mm compared to 2.75 mm. CIS-UNet's superior 3D aortic segmentation offers improved accuracy and optimization for planning endovascular treatments. Our dataset and code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/mirthAI/CIS-UNet.

TI A translational perspective towards clinical AI fairness
SO NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
ID ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; BIAS; ALGORITHM; HEALTH
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated the ability to extract insights from data, but the fairness of such data-driven insights remains a concern in high-stakes fields. Despite extensive developments, issues of AI fairness in clinical contexts have not been adequately addressed. A fair model is normally expected to perform equally across subgroups defined by sensitive variables (e.g., age, gender/sex, race/ethnicity, socio-economic status, etc.). Various fairness measurements have been developed to detect differences between subgroups as evidence of bias, and bias mitigation methods are designed to reduce the differences detected. This perspective of fairness, however, is misaligned with some key considerations in clinical contexts. The set of sensitive variables used in healthcare applications must be carefully examined for relevance and justified by clear clinical motivations. In addition, clinical AI fairness should closely investigate the ethical implications of fairness measurements (e.g., potential conflicts between group- and individual-level fairness) to select suitable and objective metrics. Generally defining AI fairness as "equality" is not necessarily reasonable in clinical settings, as differences may have clinical justifications and do not indicate biases. Instead, "equity" would be an appropriate objective of clinical AI fairness. Moreover, clinical feedback is essential to developing fair and well-performing AI models, and efforts should be made to actively involve clinicians in the process. The adaptation of AI fairness towards healthcare is not self-evident due to misalignments between technical developments and clinical considerations. Multidisciplinary collaboration between AI researchers, clinicians, and ethicists is necessary to bridge the gap and translate AI fairness into real-life benefits.

AB Morphological perceptrons use a lattice algebra approach to learn and classify a set of patterns. Dendritic structure combined with lattice algebra operations have properties that are completely different than those of traditional perceptron models. In the present paper, we focus our attention in single layer morphological perceptrons that classify correctly the parity of all bit strings of length n, as a one-class pattern recognition problem. The n-bit parity problem is the n-dimensional extension of the classic XOR problem in the Euclidean plane and is commonly used as a difficult benchmark to test the performance of training algorithms in artificial neural networks. We present results for values of n up to 10, obtained with a training algorithm based on elimination.

AB A novel functional estimator for Renyi's alpha-entropy and its multivariate extension was recently proposed in terms of the normalized eigenspectrum of a Hermitian matrix of the projected data in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). However, the utility and possible applications of these new estimators are rather new and mostly unknown to practitioners. In this brief, we first show that this estimator enables straightforward measurement of information flow in realistic convolutional neural networks (CNNs) without any approximation. Then, we introduce the partial information decomposition (PID) framework and develop three quantities to analyze the synergy and redundancy in convolutional layer representations. Our results validate two fundamental data processing inequalities and reveal more inner properties concerning CNN training.

AB The use of trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) for agricultural processing, handling, and process control, such as pattern recognition, classification and weight prediction, offers potential for multi-dimensional function fittings and enhanced accuracy in machine-vision based procedures. In this study, optimization of ANNs for machine vision based applications for better prediction accuracy has been conducted using soybean weighing as an example. Neural network systems consisting of a varying number of neurons trained under dissimilar algorithms were compared in determining the weights of soybeans based on the correlation of weight to features extracted from one- and two-direction images. Results show that imaging from the side of a soybean produces superior data to that of top-down images, and that with a properly trained neural network, weight predictions could be accurate up to a relative error of less than three percent. Furthermore, the continuous dependence of weight to features of the soybean suggested use of a training batch consisting of uniformly distributed weights.

AB We consider the periodic review dynamic pricing and inventory control problemwith fixed ordering cost. Demand is randomand price dependent, and unsatisfied demand is backlogged. With complete demand information, the celebrated (s, S, p) policy is proved to be optimal, where s and S are the reorder point and order-up-to level for ordering strategy, and p, a function of on-hand inventory level, characterizes the pricing strategy. In this paper, we consider incomplete demand information and develop online learning algorithms whose average profit approaches that of the optimal (s, S, p) with a tight (O) over tilde (root T) regret rate. A number of salient features differentiate our work from the existing online learning researches in the operations management (OM) literature. First, computing the optimal (s, S, p) policy requires solving a dynamic programming (DP) over multiple periods involving unknown quantities, which is different from the majority of learning problems in OMthat only require solving single-period optimization questions. It is hence challenging to establish stability results through DP recursions, which we accomplish by proving uniform convergence of the profit-to-go function. The necessity of analyzing action-dependent state transition over multiple periods resembles the reinforcement learning question, considerably more difficult than existing bandit learning algorithms. Second, the pricing function p is of infinite dimension, and approaching it is much more challenging than approaching a finite number of parameters as seen in existing researches. The demand-price relationship is estimated based on upper confidence bound, but the confidence interval cannot be explicitly calculated due to the complexity of the DP recursion. Finally, because of the multiperiod nature of (s, S, p) policies the actual distribution of the randomness in demand plays an important role in determining the optimal pricing strategy p, which is unknown to the learner a priori. In this paper, the demand randomness is approximated by an empirical distribution constructed using dependent samples, and a novelWassersteinmetric-based argument is employed to prove convergence of the empirical distribution.

AB The paper describes and compares alternative approaches to implementing construction simulation models within a multiprocessor computing environment. Both parallel-algorithmic and neural network based methods of simulating construction processes are considered, and compared with the conventional serial-algorithmic approach. The lines along which a simulation algorithm can be divided into tasks for parallel execution on a multiprocessor are first discussed, and the merits of each approach an identified. This is followed by a brief discourse on neural networks, their application to construction simulation. and the way in which such an implementation can be implemented within a multiprocessing environment. The merits and demerits of all approaches are discussed with particular reference to a model of an excavation system. A case study comparing the speed at which each implementation can process a simulation shows the neural approach to operate approximately two orders of magnitude faster than the alternatives. The paper concludes with an indication of future research to be conducted in this field. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Sensory manipulation as a countermeasure to robot teleoperation delays:

ID PERCEPTUAL-MOTOR DYSFUNCTION; COGNITIVE LOAD; TIME-DELAY; DESIGN; CUES
AB In the realm of robotics and automation, robot teleoperation, which facilitates human-machine interaction in distant or hazardous settings, has surged in significance. A persistent issue in this domain is the delays between command issuance and action execution, causing negative repercussions on operator situational awareness, performance, and cognitive load. These delays, particularly in long-distance operations, are difficult to mitigate even with the most advanced computing advancements. Current solutions mainly revolve around machine-based adjustments to combat these delays. However, a notable lacuna remains in harnessing human perceptions for an enhanced subjective teleoperation experience. This paper introduces a novel approach of sensory manipulation for induced human adaptation in delayed teleoperation. Drawing from motor learning and rehabilitation principles, it is posited that strategic sensory manipulation, via altered sensory stimuli, can mitigate the subjective feeling of these delays. The focus is not on introducing new skills or adapting to novel conditions; rather, it leverages prior motor coordination experience in the context of delays. The objective is to reduce the need for extensive training or sophisticated automation designs. A human-centered experiment involving 41 participants was conducted to examine the effects of modified haptic cues in teleoperations with delays. These cues were generated from high-fidelity physics engines using parameters from robot-end sensors or physics engine simulations. The results underscored several benefits, notably the considerable reduction in task time and enhanced user perceptions about visual delays. Real-time haptic feedback, or the anchoring method, emerged as a significant contributor to these benefits, showcasing reduced cognitive load, bolstered self-confidence, and minimized frustration. Beyond the prevalent methods of automation design and training, this research underscores induced human adaptation as a pivotal avenue in robot teleoperation. It seeks to enhance teleoperation efficacy through rapid human adaptation, offering insights beyond just optimizing robotic systems for delay compensations.

AB Closed-loop control of skeletal muscle is complicated by the nonlinear muscle force to length and velocity relationships and the inherent unstructured and time-varying uncertainties in available models. Some pure feedback methods have been developed with some success, but the most promising and popular control methods for neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) are neural network (NN)-based methods. Efforts in this paper focus on the use of a NN feedforward controller that is augmented with a continuous robust feedback term to yield an asymptotic result (in lieu of typical uniformly ultimately bounded stability). Specifically, an NN-based controller and Lyapunov-based stability analysis are provided to enable semi-global asymptotic tracking of a desired limb time-varying trajectory (i.e., non-isometric contractions). The developed controller is applied as an amplitude modulated voltage to external electrodes attached to the distal-medial and proximal-lateral portion of the quadriceps femoris muscle group in non-impaired volunteers. The added value of incorporating a NN feedforward term is illustrated through experiments that compare the developed controller with and without the NN feedforward component.

AB Using prosthetic devices requires a substantial cognitive workload. This study investigated classification models for assessing cognitive workload in electromyography (EMG)-based prosthetic devices with various types of input features including eye-tracking measures, task performance, and cognitive performance model (CPM) outcomes. Features selection algorithm, hyperparameter tuning with grid search, and k-fold cross-validation were applied to select the most important features and find the optimal models. Classification accuracy, the area under the receiver operation characteristic curve (AUC), precision, recall, and F1 scores were calculated to compare the models' performance. The findings suggested that task performance measures, pupillometry data, and CPM outcomes, combined with the naive bayes (NB) and random forest (RF) algorithms, are most promising for classifying cognitive workload. The proposed algorithms can help manufacturers/clinicians predict the cognitive workload of future EMG-based prosthetic devices in early design phases.Practitioner summary: This study investigated the use of machine learning algorithms for classifying the cognitive workload of prosthetic devices. The findings suggested that the models could predict workload with high accuracy and low computational cost and could be used in assessing the usability of prosthetic devices in the early phases of the design process.

AB During COVID-19, misinformation on social media has affected people's adoption of appropriate prevention behaviors. Although an array of approaches have been proposed to suppress misinformation, few have investigated the role of disseminating factual information during crises. None has examined its effect on suppressing misinformation quantitatively using longitudinal social media data. Therefore, this study investigates the temporal correlations between factual information and misinformation, and intends to answer whether previously predominant factual information can suppress misinformation. It focuses on two prevention measures, that is, wearing masks and social distancing, using tweets collected from April 3 to June 30, 2020, in the United States. We trained support vector machine classifiers to retrieve relevant tweets and classify tweets containing factual information and misinformation for each topic concerning the prevention measures' effects. Based on cross-correlation analyses of factual and misinformation time series for both topics, we find that the previously predominant factual information leads the decrease of misinformation (i.e., suppression) with a time lag. The research findings provide empirical understandings of dynamic relations between misinformation and factual information in complex online environments and suggest practical strategies for future misinformation management during crises and emergencies.

TI From sonority hierarchy to posterior probability as a measure of
   lenition: The case of Spanish stops
SO JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
LA English
DT Article
AB A deep learning Phonet model was evaluated as a method to measure lenition. Unlike quantitative acoustic methods, recurrent networks were trained to recognize the posterior probabilities of sonorant and continuant phonological features in a corpus of Argentinian Spanish. When applied to intervocalic and post-nasal voiced and voiceless stops, the approach yielded lenition patterns similar to those previously reported. Further, additional patterns also emerged. The results suggest the validity of the approach as an alternative or addition to quantitative acoustic measures of lenition.

AB We propose a new SVD algorithm based on the split-and merge strategy, which possesses an embarrassingly parallel structure and thus can be efficiently implemented on a distributed or multicore machine. The new algorithm can also be implemented in serial for online eigen-analysis. The new algorithm is particularly suitable for big data problems: Its embarrassingly parallel structure renders it usable for feature screening, while this has been beyond the ability of the existing parallel SVD algorithms.

ID SCHEME
AB In this letter, we propose a two-stage traffic load prediction scheme for network slices (NSs) in high-speed railway (HSR) wireless networks, where in the first stage, the K-means algorithm is leveraged to cluster traffic flows, and in the second stage, the long-short term memory (LSTM) algorithm is applied to predict the traffic load. Based on the obtained traffic features (including traffic volume and user velocity) and the network radio resource characteristics (including coverage performance and capacity), we design a service-tailored resource reservation mechanism. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme can significantly improve the traffic load prediction accuracy to ensure the NS resource reservation performance.

AB Over the years, 33 incidents of offshore blowout during drilling have caused significant damage to life and property. This research suggests that field engineers could prevent offshore blowout using timely detection of the impending danger, a.k.a. a kick, using big data analysis tools. In this study, the objective is to develop an algorithm that can detect a kick and display the result without any human intervention. The research purpose is to achieve immediate response time in the detection of kicks to deploy control measures. The contribution of the study is an inexpensive and generalizable automated mud-logging system for the analysis and detection of kicks in underwater drilling projects. The research innovatively implemented the genetic wavelet neural network method to monitor and predict kicks in real time. The developed kick-detection system is able to capture and represent complex input and output relationships of the primary and secondary indicators of the kick to detect any anomalies and display warning messages. Field engineers then use these messages to confirm the possible occurrence of a kick and inform the driller to perform the appropriate control. This algorithm has the potential to be a lifesaving solution for engineers and managers working on offshore projects pile drilling for bridges or waterworks.

AB Advanced endoscopy has evolved from diagnostic ERCP to an ever-increasing array of therapeutic procedures including EUS with FNA, ablative therapies, deep enteroscopy, luminal stenting, endoscopic suturing and endoscopic mucosal resection among others. As these procedures have become increasingly more complex, the risk of potential complications has also risen. Training in advanced endoscopy involves more than obtaining a minimum number of therapeutic procedures. The means of assessing a trainee's competence level and ability to practice independently continues to be a matter of debate. The use of quality indicators to measure performance levels may be beneficial as more advanced techniques and procedures become available. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The focus of this presentation is on the development of a neuroanatomical model underlying laryngeal function. It is suggested that the model can be used as an aid to the understanding of the structures that support phonatory output as well as a basis for physiological research on the nature of voice production. Although the postulates are anatomically grounded, the approach utilized also shows that there is ongoing feedback during phonation and, hence, that both the motor and sensory (neural)  networks are coordinated during any phonatory activity. Additionally, the discussion serves to review the neuroanatomical interface between respiration and voice.

AB BackgroundThere has been an increasing interest in understanding the usefulness of wrist-based accelerometer data for physical activity (PA) assessment due to the ease of use and higher user compliance than other body placements. PA assessment studies have relied on machine learning methods which take accelerometer data in forms of variables, or feature vectors.MethodsIn this work, we introduce automated shape feature derivation methods to transform epochs of accelerometer data into feature vectors. As the first step, recurring patterns in the collected data are identified and placed in a codebook. Similarities between epochs of accelerometer data and codebook's patterns are the basis of feature calculations. In this paper, we demonstrate supervised and unsupervised approaches to learn codebooks. We evaluated these methods and compared them with the standard statistical measures for PA assessment. The experiments were performed on 146 participants who wore an ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer on the right wrist and performed 33 activities of daily living.ResultsOur evaluations show that the shape feature derivation methods were able to perform comparably with the standard wrist model (F1-score: 0.89) for identifying sedentary PAs (F1-scores of 0.86 and 0.85 for supervised and unsupervised methods, respectively). This was also observed for identifying locomotion activities (F1-scores: 0.87, 0.83, and 0.81 for the standard wrist, supervised, unsupervised models, respectively). All the wrist models were able to estimate energy expenditure required for PAs with low error (rMSE: 0.90, 0.93, and 0.90 for the standard wrist, supervised, and unsupervised models, respectively).ConclusionThe automated shape feature derivation methods offer insights into the performed activities by providing a summary of repeating patterns in the accelerometer data. Furthermore, they could be used as efficient alternatives (or additions) for manually engineered features, especially important for cases where the latter fail to provide sufficient information to machine learning methods for PA assessment.

AB Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a heavily used Bayesian hierarchical model used in machine learning for modeling high-dimensional sparse count data, for example, text documents. As a Bayesian model, it incorporates a prior on a set of latent variables. The prior is indexed by some hyperparameters, which have a big impact on inference regarding the model. The ideal estimate of the hyperparameters is the empirical Bayes estimate which is, by definition, the maximizer of the marginal likelihood of the data with all the latent variables integrated out. This estimate cannot be obtained analytically. In practice, the hyperparameters are chosen either in an ad-hoc manner, or through some variants of the EM algorithm for which the theoretical basis is weak. We propose an MCMC-based fully Bayesian method for obtaining the empirical Bayes estimate of the hyperparameter. We compare our method with other existing approaches both on synthetic and real data. The comparative experiments demonstrate that the LDA model with hyperparameters specified by our method outperforms models with the hyperparameters estimated by other methods. for this article are available online.

AB Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain is a useful tool in both the clinic and research settings, aiding in the diagnosis and treatments of neurological disease and expanding our knowledge of the brain. However, there are many challenges inherent in managing and analyzing MRI data, due in large part to the heterogeneity of data acquisition. To address this, we have developed MRIO, the Magnetic Resonance Imaging Acquisition and Analysis Ontology. MRIO provides well-reasoned classes and logical axioms for the acquisition of several MRI acquisition types and well-known, peer-reviewed analysis software, facilitating the use of MRI data. These classes provide a common language for the neuroimaging research process and help standardize the organization and analysis of MRI data for reproducible datasets. We also provide queries for automated assignment of analyses for given MRI types. MRIO aids researchers in managing neuroimaging studies by helping organize and annotate MRI data and integrating with existing standards such as Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine and the Brain Imaging Data Structure, enhancing reproducibility and interoperability. MRIO was constructed according to Open Biomedical Ontologies Foundry principles and has contributed several classes to the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations to help bridge neuroimaging data to other domains. MRIO addresses the need for a "common language" for MRI that can help manage the neuroimaging research, by enabling researchers to identify appropriate analyses for sets of scans and facilitating data organization and reporting.

AB Introduction: Understanding and managing clinician workload is important for clinician (nurses, physicians and advanced practice providers) occupational health as well as patient safety. Efforts have been made to develop strategies for managing clinician workload by improving patient assignment. The goal of the current study is to use electronic health record (EHR) data to predict the amount of work that individual patients contribute to clinician workload (patient-related workload).
   Methods: One month of EHR data was retrieved from an emergency department (ED). A list of workload indicators and five potential workload proxies were extracted from the data. Linear regression and four machine learning classification algorithms were utilized to model the relationship between the indicators and the proxies. Results: Linear regression proved that the indicators explained a substantial amount of variance of the proxies (four out of five proxies were modeled with R2 > 0.80). Classification algorithms also showed success in classifying a patient as having high or low task demand based on data from early in the ED visit (e.g. 80 % accurate binary classification with data from the first hour).
   Conclusion: The main contribution of this study is demonstrating the potential of using EHR data to predict patient-related workload automatically in the ED. The predicted workload can potentially help in managing clinician workload by supporting decisions around the assignment of new patients to providers. Future work should focus on identifying the relationship between workload proxies and actual workload, as well as improving prediction performance of regression and multi-class classification.

AB The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission delivers time-series photometry for millions of stars across the sky, offering a probe into stellar astrophysics, including rotation, on a population scale. However, light-curve systematics related to the satellite's 13.7 day orbit have prevented stellar rotation searches for periods longer than 13 days, putting the majority of stars beyond reach. Machine-learning methods have the ability to identify systematics and recover robust signals, enabling us to recover rotation periods up to 35 days for GK dwarfs and 80 days for M dwarfs. We present a catalog of 7245 rotation periods for cool dwarfs in the Southern Continuous Viewing Zone, estimated using convolutional neural networks. We find evidence for structure in the period distribution consistent with prior Kepler and K2 results, including a gap in 10-20 day cool-star periods thought to arise from a change in stellar spin-down or activity. Using a combination of spectroscopic and gyrochronologic constraints, we fit stellar evolution models to estimate masses and ages for stars with rotation periods. We find strong correlations between the detectability of rotation in TESS and the effective temperature, age, and metallicity of the stars. Finally, we investigate the relationships between rotation and newly obtained spot filling fractions estimated from Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment spectra. Field starspot filling fractions are elevated in the same temperature and period regime where open clusters' magnetic braking stalls, lending support to an internal shear mechanism that can produce both phenomena.

AB Understanding structure-activity landscapes is essential in drug discovery. Similarly, it has been shown that the presence of activity cliffs in compound data sets can have a substantial impact not only on the design progress but also can influence the predictive ability of machine learning models. With the continued expansion of the chemical space and the currently available large and ultra-large libraries, it is imperative to implement efficient tools to analyze the activity landscape of compound data sets rapidly. The goal of this study is to show the applicability of the n-ary indices to quantify the structure-activity landscapes of large compound data sets using different types of structural representation rapidly and efficiently. We also discuss how a recently introduced medoid algorithm provides the foundation to finding optimum correlations between similarity measures and structure-activity rankings. The applicability of the n-ary indices and the medoid algorithm is shown by analyzing the activity landscape of 10 compound data sets with pharmaceutical relevance using three fingerprints of different designs, 16 extended similarity indices, and 11 coincidence thresholds.

AB A continuous controller is developed for a robot that moves in free space, undergoes a collision with a viscoelastic environment, and then regulates the new coupled dynamic system to a desired setpoint. Since the model for the viscoelastic surface contains uncertainties that do not satisfy the linear-in-the-parameters assumption, the model is approximated by a neural network feedforward term, which is combined with a continuous feedback term to guarantee uniformly ultimately bounded regulation of the system despite parametric uncertainties in the robot and the viscoelastic environment. Experimental results of a two-link robot interacting with a human tissue phantom demonstrate the performance of the proposed controller.

AB Motivation Anti-poverty programmes can work as a comprehensive data source of poor households' economic behaviour and performance, a resource that is particularly scarce in environments without formal credit scores or households that have minimal involvement in economic activities. Purpose This study examines the potential role of information generated by an anti-poverty programme on self-selection by borrowers (i.e., applying for a loan), screening applicants by lenders (i.e., loan approval), and borrower performance in the microcredit market. Methods and approach We apply the logistic regression, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), and Random Forest (RF) methods to predict self-selection, screening, and post-loan outcomes. Findings We show that the rate of accurate prediction is about 70% for self-selection and screening. We find that the prediction accuracy rate is 68% for productive use and 91% for repayment difficulty. Objective indicators (e.g., income, assets, age of the household head, savings) stand as the most influential predictors of self-selection, screening, and post-loan outcomes. Policy implications Development programmes can improve availability of data needed to predict creditworthiness, suggesting that there could be potential to expand credit access among poor borrowers through partnerships between development agencies and financial institutions.

AB We present a new suite of over 1500 cosmological N-body simulations with varied warm dark matter (WDM) models ranging from 2.5 to 30 keV. We use these simulations to train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to infer WDM particle masses from images of DM field data. Our fiducial setup can make accurate predictions of the WDM particle mass up to 7.5 keV with an uncertainty of +/- 0.5 keV at a 95 per cent confidence level from (25 h(-1)Mpc)(2) maps. We vary the image resolution, simulation resolution, redshift, and cosmology of our fiducial setup to better understand how our model is making predictions. Using these variations, we find that our models are most dependent on simulation resolution, minimally dependent on image resolution, not systematically dependent on redshift, and robust to varied cosmologies. We also find that an important feature to distinguish between WDM models is present with a linear size between 100 and 200 h(-1) kpc. We compare our fiducial model to one trained on the power spectrum alone and find that our field-level model can make two times more precise predictions and can make accurate predictions to two times as massive WDM particle masses when used on the same data. Overall, we find that the field-level data can be used to accurately differentiate between WDM models and contain more information than is captured by the power spectrum. This technique can be extended to more complex DM models and opens up new opportunities to explore alternative DM models in a cosmological environment.

TI Protein-ligand binding affinity prediction with edge awareness and
   supervised attention
SO ISCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
ID STRUCTURE-BASED DESIGN; DATABASE; DOCKING; MODEL
AB Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity is crucial in structure-based drug design but remains some challenges even with recent advances in deep learning: (1) Existing methods neglect the edge information in protein and ligand structure data; (2) current attention mechanisms struggle to capture true binding interactions in the small dataset. Herein, we proposed SEGSA_DTA, a SuperEdge Graph convolution-based and Supervised Attention-based Drug-Target Affinity prediction method, where the super edge graph convolution can comprehensively utilize node and edge information and the multi-supervised attention module can efficiently learn the attention distribution consistent with real protein-ligand interactions. Results on the multiple datasets show that SEGSA_DTA outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. We also applied SEGSA_DTA in repurposing FDA-approved drugs to identify potential coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) treatments. Besides, by using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), we found that SEGSA_DTA is interpretable and further provides a new quantitative analytical solution for structure-based lead optimization.

AB Background: It is not clear how specific gait measures reflect disease severity across the disease spectrum in Parkinson's disease (PD).
   Objective: To identify the gait and mobility measures that are most sensitive and reflective of PD motor stages and determine the optimal sensor location in each disease stage.
   Methods: Cross-sectional wearable-sensor records were collected in 332 patients with PD (Hoehn and Yahr scale I-III) and 100 age-matched healthy controls. Sensors were adhered to the participant's lower back, bilateral ankles, and wrists. Study participants walked in a similar to 15-meter corridor for 1 minute under two walking conditions: (1) preferred, usual walking speed and (2) walking while engaging in a cognitive task (dual-task). A subgroup (n = 303, 67% PD) also performed the Timed Up and Go test. Multiple machine-learning feature selection and classification algorithms were applied to discriminate between controls and PD and between the different PD severity stages.
   Results: High discriminatory values were found between motor disease stages with mean sensitivity in the range 72%-83%, specificity 69%-80%, and area under the curve (AUC) 0.76-0.90. Measures from upper-limb sensors best discriminated controls from early PD, turning measures obtained from the trunk sensor were prominent in mid-stage PD, and stride timing and regularity were discriminative in more advanced stages.
   Conclusions: Applying machine-learning to multiple, wearable-derived features reveals that different measures of gait and mobility are associated with and discriminate distinct stages of PD. These disparate feature sets can augment the objective monitoring of disease progression and may be useful for cohort selection and power analyses in clinical trials of PD.

DE river segmentation; contrastive learning; multi-source data
ID SURFACE-WATER
AB River system is critical for the future sustainability of our planet but is always under the pressure of food, water and energy demands. Recent advances in machine learning bring a great potential for automatic river mapping using satellite imagery. Surface river mapping can provide accurate and timely water extent information that is highly valuable for solid policy and management decisions. However, accurate large-scale river mapping remains challenging given limited labels, spatial heterogeneity and noise in satellite imagery (e.g., clouds and aerosols). In this paper, we propose a new multi-source data-driven method for large-scale river mapping by combining multi-spectral imagery and synthetic aperture radar data. In particular, we build a multi-source data segmentation model, which uses contrastive learning to extract the common information between multiple data sources while also preserving distinct knowledge from each data source. Moreover, we create the first large-scale multi-source river imagery dataset based on Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite data, along with 1013 handmade accurate river segmentation mask (which will be released to the public). In this dataset, our method has been shown to produce superior performance (F1-score is 91.53%) over multiple state-of-the-art segmentation algorithms. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed contrastive learning model in mapping river extent when we have limited and noisy data.

AB As an empirical effort to explore the public relations potential of AI-enabled technologies such as chatbots, this study examined how chatbot social conversation-a communication strategy that encompasses both social presence and conversational human voice and is conceptualized in consideration of chatbots' mediated communication environment-can contribute to organization-public relational outcomes (i.e., OPRs). To understand how this process works, we incorporate the personification approach to organizations, and also investigate the impact of chatbot social conversation in shaping public perceptions of corporate character (i.e., agreeableness, enterprise, competence, and ruthlessness). A survey of 778 Facebook users in the United States was conducted, where participants were randomly assigned to have a guided conversation with an AI-enabled social chatbot utilized by real companies on Facebook. Results confirm that chatbot social conversation can serve as a strong antecedent of the corporate character of the organization that deployed it and OPRs. Perceived corporate character also directly influences the quality of OPRs, demonstrating the potential of using AI-enabled social chatbots for public relations purposes.

AB The paper describes and evaluates three methods of modelling earthquake accelerograms using artificial neural networks and linear predictors. These are a radial-Gaussian neural networking system, a linear predictor, and a hybrid of these two. Two methods of using these models to predict ground acceleration are adopted. The first is based on a direct prediction of ground acceleration at some point in time in the future from a series of ground accelerations that occurred earlier in the earthquake event. The second is a recursive approach whereby a model predicts a sequence of future ground accelerations by feeding back its predictions to its inputs. The performances of the models are tested using the 1985 Mexico earthquake and aftershock. The linear predictor and hybrid models perform best at direct prediction while none of the models perform particularly well at recursive prediction. The paper concludes with an outline of some areas for future work.

AB In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) advancements have greatly influenced the agricultural industry, particularly with the emergence of large foundation models. One such model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) developed by Meta AI Research, has revolutionized object segmentation tasks. While SAM has demonstrated success in various agricultural applications, its potential in the poultry industry, specifically regarding cage-free hens, remains largely unexplored. This study aims to evaluate SAM's zero-shot segmentation performance for chicken segmentation tasks, including part-based segmentation and the utilization of infrared thermal images. Additionally, it investigates SAM's ability to predict weight and track chickens. The results highlight SAM's superior performance compared to SegFormer and SETR for both whole and part-based chicken segmentation. SAM demonstrated remarkable performance improvements, achieving a mean intersection of union (mIoU) of 94.8% when using the total points prompts. Furthermore, SAM-based chicken segmentation provides valuable insights into weight prediction, as well as behavior and movement patterns of broiler birds. These findings contribute to the understanding of SAM's potential in poultry science, paving the way for future advancements in chicken segmentation and tracking using large foundation model.

ID DESIGN
AB Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have become an attractive choice for diverse applications due to their reconfigurability and unique security features. However, designs mapped to FPGAs are prone to malicious modifications or tampering of critical functions. Besides, targeted modifications have demonstrably compromised FPGA implementations of various cryptographic primitives. Existing security measures based on encryption and authentication can be bypassed using their side-channel vulnerabilities to execute bitstream tampering attacks. Furthermore, numerous resource-constrained applications are now equipped with low-end FPGAs, which may not support power-hungry cryptographic solutions. In this article, we propose a novel obfuscation-based approach to achieve strong resistance against both random and targeted pre-configuration tampering of critical functions in an FPGA design. Our solution first identifies the unique structural and functional features that separate the critical function from the rest of the design using a machine learning guided framework. The selected features are eliminated by applying appropriate obfuscation techniques, many of which take advantage of "FPGA dark silicon"-unused lookup table resources-to mask the critical functions. Furthermore, following the same obfuscation principle, a redundancy-based technique is proposed to thwart targeted, rule-based, and random tampering. We have developed a complete methodology and custom software toolflow that integrates with commercial tools. By applying the masking technique on a design containing AES, we show the effectiveness of the proposed framework in hiding the critical S-Box function. We implement the redundancy integrated solution in various cryptographic designs to analyze the overhead. To protect 16.2% critical component of a design, the proposed approach incurs an average area overhead of only 2.4% over similar redundancy-based approaches, while achieving strong security.

AB For a segmentation and dynamic programming-based handwritten word recognition system, outlier rejection at the character level can improve word recognition performance because it reduces the chances that erroneous combinations of segments result in high word confidence values. We Studied the multilayer perceptron (MLP) and a variant of radial basis function network (RBF) with the goal to use them as character level classifiers that have enhanced outlier rejection ability. The variant of the RBF uses principal component analysis (PCA) on the clusters defined by the nodes in the hidden layer. It was also trained with and without a regularization term that was aimed at minimizing the variances of the nodes in the hidden layer. Our experiments on handwritten word recognition showed: ( I) In the case of MLPs, using more hidden nodes than that required for classification and including Outliers in the training data can improve outlier rejection performance, (2) in the case of PCA-RBFs, training with the regularization term and no outlier can achieve performance very close to training with outliers. These results are both interesting. Result ( I) is of interest because it is well known that minimizing the number of parameters, and therefore keeping the number of hidden units low, should increase the generalization capability. On the other hand, using more hidden units increases the chances of creating closed decision regions, as predicted by the theory in Gori and Scarselli (IEEE Trans. PAMI 20 (11) (1998) 1121). Result is a strong g statement in support of the use of regularization terms for the training of RBF-type neural networks in problems such as handwriting recognition for which outlier rejection is important. Additional tests on combining MLPs and PCA-RBF networks showed the potential to improve word recognition performance by exploiting the complementarity of these two kinds of neural networks.

AB T. forsythia is a subgingival periodontal bacterium constituting the subgingival pathogenic polymicrobial milieu during periodontitis (PD). miRNAs play a pivotal role in maintaining periodontal tissue homeostasis at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and epigenetic levels. The aim of this study was to characterize the global microRNAs (miRNA, miR) expression kinetics in 8- and 16-week-old T. forsythia-infected C57BL/6J mouse mandibles and to identify the miRNA bacterial biomarkers of disease process at specific time points. We examined the differential expression (DE) of miRNAs in mouse mandibles (n = 10) using high-throughput NanoString nCounter (R) miRNA expression panels, which provided significant advantages over specific candidate miRNA or pathway analyses. All the T. forsythia-infected mice at two specific time points showed bacterial colonization (100%) in the gingival surface, along with a significant increase in alveolar bone resorption (ABR) (p < 0.0001). We performed a NanoString analysis of specific miRNA signatures, miRNA target pathways, and gene network analysis. A total of 115 miRNAs were DE in the mandible tissue during 8 and 16 weeks The T. forsythia infection, compared with sham infection, and the majority (99) of DE miRNAs were downregulated. nCounter miRNA expression kinetics identified 67 downregulated miRNAs (e.g., miR-375, miR-200c, miR-200b, miR-34b-5p, miR-141) during an 8-week infection, whereas 16 upregulated miRNAs (e.g., miR-1902, miR-let-7c, miR-146a) and 32 downregulated miRNAs (e.g., miR-2135, miR-720, miR-376c) were identified during a 16-week infection. Two miRNAs, miR-375 and miR-200c, were highly downregulated with >twofold change during an 8-week infection. Six miRNAs in the 8-week infection (miR-200b, miR-141, miR-205, miR-423-3p, miR-141-3p, miR-34a-5p) and two miRNAs in the 16-week infection (miR-27a-3p, miR-15a-5p) that were downregulated have also been reported in the gingival tissue and saliva of periodontitis patients. This preclinical in vivo study identified T. forsythia-specific miRNAs (miR-let-7c, miR-210, miR-146a, miR-423-5p, miR-24, miR-218, miR-26b, miR-23a-3p) and these miRs have also been reported in the gingival tissues and saliva of periodontitis patients. Further, several DE miRNAs that are significantly upregulated (e.g., miR-101b, miR-218, miR-127, miR-24) are also associated with many systemic diseases such as atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, diabetes, obesity, and several cancers. In addition to DE analysis, we utilized the XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient boost) and Random Forest machine learning (ML) algorithms to assess the impact that the number of miRNA copies has on predicting whether a mouse is infected. XGBoost found that miR-339-5p was most predictive for mice infection at 16 weeks. miR-592-5p was most predictive for mice infection at 8 weeks and also when the 8-week and 16-week results were grouped together. Random Forest predicted miR-592 as most predictive at 8 weeks as well as the combined 8-week and 16-week results, but miR-423-5p was most predictive at 16 weeks. In conclusion, the expression levels of miR-375 and miR-200c family differed significantly during disease process, and these miRNAs establishes a link between T. forsythia and development of periodontitis genesis, offering new insights regarding the pathobiology of this bacterium.

AB Banana Fusarium wilt (BFW) is a devastating disease with no effective cure methods. Timely and effective detection of the disease and evaluation of its spreading trend will help farmers in making right decisions on plantation management. The main purpose of this study was to find the spectral features of the BFW-infected canopy and build the optimal BFW classification models for different stages of infection. A RedEdge-MX camera mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was used to collect multispectral images of a banana plantation infected with BFW in July and August 2020. Three types of spectral features were used as the inputs of classification models, including three-visible-band images, five-multispectral-band images, and vegetation indices (VIs). Four supervised methods including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Back Propagation Neural Networks (BPNN) and Logistic Regression (LR), and two unsupervised methods including Hotspot Analysis (HA) and Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique Algorithm (ISODATA) were adopted to detect the BFW-infected canopies. Comparing to the healthy canopies, the BFW-infected canopies had higher reflectance in the visible region, but lower reflectance in the NIR region. The classification results showed that most of the supervised and unsupervised methods reached excellent accuracies. Among all the supervised methods, RF based on the five-multispectral-band was considered as the optimal model, with higher overall accuracy (OA) of 97.28% and faster running time of 22 min. For the unsupervised methods, HA reached high and balanced OAs of more than 95% based on the selected VIs derived from the red and NIR band, especially for WDRVI, NDVI, and TDVI. By comprehensively evaluating the classification results of different metrics, the unsupervised method HA was recommended for BFW recognition, especially in the late stage of infection; the supervised method RF was recommended in the early stage of infection to reach a slightly higher accuracy. The results found in this study could give advice for banana plantation management and provide approaches for plant disease detection.

AB Public opinion is a valuable source for evaluating the performance of transportation services, which can guide management and policy adjustment. In contrast to traditional surveying methods, which are often inefficient and high-cost, social media has become a popular channel to collect public opinion due to its large data volume and accessibility characteristics. However, existing research lack efficient methods to extract and interpret Twitter data for transportation services evaluation. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive framework that enables high-efficient extraction and analysis of public opinions on transportation services from Twitter. The transportation system of Miami-Dade County is chosen as the case study to describe the framework development and validation process. First, Twitter data in a defined area over a certain period are collected and preprocessed to clean erroneous and redundant information. Then, the Twitter data that relate to personal opinions on transportation services (POTS) are filtered hieratically using text classification models trained by manually labeled dataset. Next, timeline analysis using Post Intensity (PI) and Average Sentiment Value (ASV) is implemented on the selected Twitter data to explore the public perceptions towards the transportation-related events. Topic modeling and tokenization techniques are also adopted to extract relevant semantic content needed for data analysis. Significantly, the developed framework can improve the efficiency of Twitter data extraction and analysis. Many manual steps are involved in the development process of the framework while can be avoided when generalized to other applications. The framework can be used as a tool for stakeholders to enable a holistic understanding of public opinions on transportation services and increase the degree of public participation in transportation management.

AB Patients in critical care settings often require continuous and multifaceted monitoring. However, current clinical monitoring practices fail to capture important functional and behavioral indices such as mobility or agitation. Recent advances in non-invasive sensing technology, high throughput computing, and deep learning techniques are expected to transform the existing patient monitoring paradigm by enabling and streamlining granular and continuous monitoring of these crucial critical care measures. In this review, we highlight current approaches to pervasive sensing in critical care and identify limitations, future challenges, and opportunities in this emerging field.

AB Behavioral recovery in animal models of human CNS syndromes suggests that transplanted stem cell derivatives can augment damaged neural networks but the mechanisms behind potentiated recovery remain elusive. Here we use microelectrode array (MEA) technology to document neural activity and network integration as rat primary neurons and rat hippocampal neural progenitor cells (NPCs) differentiate and mature. The natural transition from neuroblast to functional excitatory neuron consists of intermediate phases of differentiation characterized by coupled activity. High-frequency network-wide bursting or "superbursting" is a hallmark of early plasticity that is ultimately refined into mature stable neural network activity. Microelectrode array (MEA)-plated neurons transition through this stage of coupled superbursting before establishing mature neuronal phenotypes in vitro. When plated alone, adult rat hippocampal NPC-derived neurons fail to establish the synchronized bursting activity that neurons in primary and embryonic stem cell-derived cultures readily form. However, adult rat hippocampal NPCs evoke re-emergent superbursting in electrophysiologically mature rat primary neural cultures. Developmental superbursting is thought to accompany transient states of heightened plasticity both in culture preparations and across brain regions. Future work exploring whether NPCs can re-stimulate developmental states in injury models would be an interesting test of their regenerative potential. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The Internet-of-Thing (IoT) era inspires a surge of networked embedded devices in the real world. However, cyber-attacks such as malware intrusions pose severe concerns about the security of the entire IoT space by hijacking the devices, altering the application's execution, and/or causing a denial of services. Traditional operating-system-level and built-in hardware detection solutions either induce drastic performance degradation or incur high overhead to the system, failing to provide protection in a timely and affordable fashion. On the other hand, external side-channel-based security monitoring becomes an attractive scheme for addressing the dilemma because the observable physical properties of a running electronic device, such as power consumption and electromagnetic (EM) emanations, can deliver a good amount of information for the underlying operations. In this article, we present TrustGuard, a standalone security monitoring framework integrating both power side-channel capturing and machine learning (ML)-based malware detection capabilities on the same field-programmable gate array (FPGA) fabric. We eliminate the need for dedicated sampling equipment like an oscilloscope with an on-chip configurable sensor FPGA analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and enable agile prototyping of ML accelerator for attack detection through the high-level synthesis (HLS) technique. We deploy the outcome hardware sensor and security monitor on the Xilinx ZCU104 platform to target the prevalent BeagleBone Black (BBB) board by profiling the behaviors of uncompromised benchmark applications and discovering the anomalies introduced by the attack vectors, including malware infections, code injection, and code reuse. The experimental results demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of TrustGuard by achieving more than 90% malware detection accuracy.

AB Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing has been established as one of the most promising tools for large-scale forest monitoring and mapping. Continuous advances in computational techniques, such as machine learning algorithms, have been increasingly improving our capability to model forest attributes accurately and at high spatial and temporal resolution. While there have been previous studies exploring the use of LiDAR and machine learning algorithms for forest inventory modeling, as yet, no studies have demonstrated the combined impact of sample size and different modeling techniques for predicting and mapping stem total volume in industrial Eucalyptus spp. tree plantations. This study aimed to compare the combined effects of parametric and nonparametric modeling methods for estimating volume in Eucalyptus spp. tree plantation using airborne LiDAR data while varying the reference data (sample size). The modeling techniques were compared in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), bias, and R-2 with 500 simulations. The best performance was verified for the ordinary least-squares (OLS) method, which was able to provide comparable results to the traditional forest inventory approaches using only 40% (n = 63; similar to 0.04 plots/ha) of the total field plots, followed by the random forest (RF) algorithm with identical sample size values. This study provides solutions for increasing the industry efficiency in monitoring and managing forest plantation stem volume for the paper and pulp supply chain.

ID RISK ANALYSIS
AB Historically, actual construction costs have tended to exceed initial cost estimates and budgets. Often this discrepancy is significant enough to cause problems such as depletions of budgets, disputes, and reductions in work quality. Cost contingency is an important element included in the base cost estimate to protect construction participants including owners, contractors, and architects from the risks associated with underestimating project cost estimates and overrunning cost budgets. Typically, project participants have simply calculated contingency as a fixed percentage of project cost in spite of the importance of contingency. The uniform application of this deterministic method to calculate contingency on the basis of project costs only is not appropriate for all construction projects. This paper identifies factors that influence contingency and proposes a new method for predicting the owner's financial contingency on transportation construction projects using an artificial neural network (ANN)-based method. Asphalt resurfacing works among transportation projects sponsored by the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) completed from 2004-2006 are used for this study. The results show the viability of the ANN approach in the prediction of contingency. Accurate predictions of contingencies using this approach can help project administrators better manage contingency requirements on financing projects, allowing a more optimal usage of available project funds.

AB We present a system of PDEs for image restoration, which consists of an anisotropic diffusion equation driven by a diffusion tensor, whose structure depends on the gradient of the image obtained from a coupled time-delay regularization equation, and governs the direction and the speed of the diffusion. The diffusion resulting from this model is isotropic inside a homogeneous region, anisotropic along its boundary, and is able to connect broken edges and enhance coherent structures. Experimental results are given to show its effectiveness in tracking edges and recovering images with high levels of noise. Moreover, the proposed model can be interpreted as a time continuous Hopfield neural network. This connection further illustrates how the proposed model enhances coherent structures. The existence, uniqueness, and stability for the solutions of the PDEs are proved. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

ID REMAINING USEFUL LIFE
AB In industrial system health management, prognostics play a crucial role in ensuring safety and enhancing system availability. While the data-driven approach is the most common for this purpose, they often face challenges due to insufficient training data. This study delves into the prognostic capabilities of four methods under the conditions of limited training datasets. The methods evaluated include two neural network-based approaches, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and two similarity-based methods, Trajectory Similarity-Based Prediction (TSBP) and Data Augmentation Prognostics (DAPROG), with the last being a novel contribution from the authors. The performance of these algorithms is compared using the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (CMAPSS) datasets, which are made by simulation of turbofan engine performance degradation. To simulate real-world scenarios of data deficiency, a small fraction of the training datasets from the original dataset is chosen at random for the training, and a comprehensive assessment is conducted for each method in terms of remaining useful life prediction. The results of our study indicate that, while the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model generally outperforms others in terms of overall accuracy, Data Augmentation Prognostics (DAPROG) shows comparable performance in the small training dataset, being particularly effective within the range of 10% to 30%. Data Augmentation Prognostics (DAPROG) also exhibits lower variance in its predictions, suggesting a more consistent performance. This is worth highlighting, given the typical challenges associated with artificial neural network methods, such as inherent randomness, non-intuitive decision-making processes, and the complexities involved in developing optimal models.

AB Lossy compression introduces artifacts, and many conventional in-loop filters have been adopted in the AV1 standard to reduce these artifacts. Researchers have explored deep learning-based filters to remove artifacts in the compression loop. However, the high computational complexity of CNN-based filters remains a challenge. In this paper, a Texture-and Motion-Aware Perception (TMAP) in-loop filter is proposed to addresses this issue by selectively applying CNNs to texture-rich and high-motion regions, while utilizing non-learning methods to detect these regions. The proposed method introduces a new CNN structure, the Dense-Dual-Field Network (DDFN), which leverages a larger receptive field to enhance the quality of reconstructed frames by incorporating more contextual information. Furthermore, to improve perceptual quality, a novel loss function integrating wavelet-based perceptual information is presented. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed models over other lightweight CNN models, and the effectiveness of the perceptual loss function is validated using the VMAF metric.

AB Principal component analysis (PCA) and Kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) are fundamental methods in machine learning for dimensionality reduction. The former is a technique for finding this approximation in finite dimensions and the latter is often in an infinite dimensional reproducing Kernel Hilbert-space (RKHS). In this paper, we present a geometric framework for computing the principal linear subspaces in both (finite and infinite) situations as well as for the robust PCA case, that amounts to computing the intrinsic average on the space of all subspaces: the Grassmann manifold. Points on this manifold are defined as the subspaces spanned by K-tuples of observations. The intrinsic Grassmann average of these subspaces are shown to coincide with the principal components of the observations when they are drawn from a Gaussian distribution. We show similar results in the RKHS case and provide an efficient algorithm for computing the projection onto the this average subspace. The result is a method akin to KPCA which is substantially faster. Further, we present a novel online version of the KPCA using our geometric framework. Competitive performance of all our algorithms are demonstrated on a variety of real and synthetic data sets.

AB The extent to which visuocortical processing is altered when observers learn to categorize novel visual stimuli via labeling is not well understood. The present investigation used steady state visual evoked potential (ssVEP) frequency tagging to test the hypothesis that learning to categorize novel objects via labeling prompts a competitive advantage over concurrently presented stimuli. In the learning (label-training) phase, participants (n = 24) categorized objects according to two different species labels and faces according to gender. A control group (n = 26) viewed the same stimuli without label learning. Before and after learning, faces and objects were superimposed and viewed concurrently while periodically turned on and off at unique temporal rates (5/s or 6/s). The spectral power of the ssVEP at each frequency was projected to an L2 (minimum) norm estimated source space, and competition between faces and objects was compared using permutation-controlled mass univariate a tests. Results showed that, only in the training group, learning to label novel objects led to a competitive advantage over faces across a network of occipito-temporal and fronto-parietal cortical regions. These changes were more pronounced in participants showing more improvement across the label learning phase. Together, the findings support the notion that learning to label novel object categories affects neural competition though recurrent neural interactions in regions commonly associated with visual perception and selective attention.

AB Objective: To identify potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for clinical management and clinical trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Methods: We analysed proteomics data of ALS patient-induced pluripotent stem cell derived motor neurons available through the AnswerALS consortium. After stratifying patients using clinical ALSFRS-R and ALS-CBS scales, we identified differentially expressed proteins indicative of ALS disease severity and progression rate as candidate ALS-related and prognostic biomarkers. Pathway analysis for identified proteins was performed using STITCH. Protein sets were correlated with the effects of drugs using the Connectivity Map tool to identify compounds likely to affect similar pathways. RNAi screening was performed in a Drosophila TDP-43 ALS model to validate pathological relevance. A statistical classification machine learning model was constructed using ridge regression that uses proteomics data to differentiate ALS patients from controls. Results: We identified 76, 21, 71 and 1 candidate ALS-related biomarkers and 22, 41, 27 and 64 candidate prognostic biomarkers from patients stratified by ALSFRS-R baseline, ALSFRS-R progression slope, ALS-CBS baseline and ALS-CBS progression slope, respectively. Nineteen proteins enhanced or suppressed pathogenic eye phenotypes in the ALS fly model. Nutraceuticals, dopamine pathway modulators, statins, anti-inflammatories and antimicrobials were predicted starting points for drug repurposing using the connectivity map tool. Ten diagnostic biomarker proteins were predicted by machine learning to identify ALS patients with high accuracy and sensitivity. Interpretation: This study showcases the powerful approach of iPSC-motor neuron proteomics combined with machine learning and biological confirmation in the prediction of novel mechanisms and diagnostic and predictive biomarkers in ALS.

AB Deep neural networks (DNNs) are utilized in numerous image processing, object detection, and video analysis tasks and need to be implemented using hardware accelerators to achieve practical speed. Logic locking is one of the most popular methods for preventing chip counterfeiting. Nevertheless, existing logic-locking schemes need to sacrifice the number of input patterns leading to wrong output under incorrect keys to resist the powerful satisfiability (SAT)-attack. Furthermore, the DNN model inference is fault tolerant. Hence, using a wrong key for those SAT-resistant logic-locking schemes may not affect the accuracy of DNNs. This makes the previous SAT-resistant logic-locking scheme ineffective on protecting DNN accelerators. Besides, to prevent DNN models from being illegally used, the models need to be obfuscated by the designers before they are provided to end-users. Previous obfuscation methods either require a long time to retrain the model or leak information about the model. This article proposes a joint protection scheme for DNN hardware accelerators and models. The DNN accelerator is modified using a hardware key (Hkey) and a model key (Mkey). Different from previous logic locking, the Hkey, which is used to protect the accelerator, does not affect the output when it is wrong. As a result, the SAT attack can be effectively resisted. On the other hand, a wrong Hkey leads to substantial increase in memory accesses, inference time, and energy consumption and makes the accelerator unusable. A correct Mkey can recover the DNN model that is obfuscated by the proposed method. Compared to previous model obfuscation schemes, our proposed method avoids model retraining and does not leak model information.

ID PREDICTION
AB Normalization of gait data is performed to reduce the effects of intersubject variations due to physical characteristics. This study reports a multiple regression normalization approach for spatiotemporal gait data that takes into account intersubject variations in self-selected walking speed and physical properties including age, height, body mass, and sex. Spatiotemporal gait data including stride length, cadence, stance time, double support time, and stride time were obtained from healthy subjects including 782 children, 71 adults, 29 elderly subjects, and 28 elderly Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Data were normalized using standard dimensionless equations, a detrending method, and a multiple regression approach. After normalization using dimensionless equations and the detrending method, weak to moderate correlations between walking speed, physical properties, and spatiotemporal gait features were observed (0.01 < vertical bar r vertical bar < 0.88), whereas normalization using the multiple regression method reduced these correlations to weak values (vertical bar r vertical bar <0.29). Data normalization using dimensionless equations and detrending resulted in significant differences in stride length and double support time of PD patients; however the multiple regression approach revealed significant differences in these features as well as in cadence, stance time, and stride time. The proposed multiple regression normalization may be useful in machine learning, gait classification, and clinical evaluation of pathological gait patterns.

AB Acquiring new knowledge without interfering with old knowledge is a key issue in designing an incremental-learning system. The success of such a system hinges on an embedded incrementable information structure with improved performance over time, This paper describes an incremental-learning network for pattern recognition that uses a rule-based connectionist technique to represent general domain and case-specific knowledge, uses bounded weight modification to update its connection weights, and also performs structural learning. Specific strategies are developed for preventing overtraining and for incrementally growing and pruning the network, The soundness of this approach is demonstrated by empirical studies in two independent domains.

AB A novel approach to rule refinement based upon connectionism is presented. This approach is capable of performing rule deletion, rule addition, changing rule quality, and modification of rule strengths. The fundamental algorithm referred to as the Consistent-Shift algorithm. Its basis for identifying incorrect connections is that incorrect connections will often undergo larger inconsistent weight shift than correct ones during training with correct samples. By properly adjusting the detection threshold, incorrect connections would be uncovered, which can then be deleted or modified. Deletion of incorrect connections and addition of correct connections then translate into various forms of rule refinement just mentioned.

AB Impedimetric biosensors for measuring small molecules based on weak/transient interactions between bioreceptors and target analytes are a challenge for detection electronics, particularly in field studies or in the analysis of complex matrices. Protein-ligand binding sensors have enormous potential for biosensing, but achieving accuracy in complex solutions is a major challenge. There is a need for simple post hoc analytical tools that are not computationally expensive, yet provide near real time feedback on data derived from impedance spectra. Here, we show the use of a simple, open source support vector machine learning algorithm for analyzing impedimetric data in lieu of using equivalent circuit analysis. We demonstrate two different protein-based biosensors to show that the tool can be used for various applications. We conclude with a mobile phone-based demonstration focused on the measurement of acetone, an important biomarker related to the onset of diabetic ketoacidosis. In all conditions tested, the open source classifier was capable of performing as well as, or better, than the equivalent circuit analysis for characterizing weak/transient interactions between a model ligand (acetone) and a small chemosensory protein derived from the tsetse fly. In addition, the tool has a low computational requirement, facilitating use for mobile acquisition systems such as mobile phones. The protocol is deployed through Jupyter notebook (an open source computing environment available for mobile phone, tablet or computer use) and the code was written in Python. For each of the applications, we provide step-by-step instructions in English, Spanish, Mandarin and Portuguese to facilitate widespread use. All codes were based on scikit-learn, an open source software machine learning library in the Python language, and were processed in Jupyter notebook, an open-source web application for Python. The tool can easily be integrated with the mobile biosensor equipment for rapid detection, facilitating use by a broad range of impedimetric biosensor users. This post hoc analysis tool can serve as a launchpad for the convergence of nanobiosensors in planetary health monitoring applications based on mobile phone hardware.

ID QSAR TREATMENT; PREDICTION; INHIBITORS; MODELS; QSPR
AB An investigation of the neural network convergence and prediction based on three optimization algorithms, namely, Levenberg-Marquardt, conjugate gradient, and delta rule, is described. Several simulated neural networks built using the above three algorithms indicated that the Levenberg-Marquardt optimizer implemented as a back-propagation neural network converged faster than the other two algorithms and provides in most of the cases better prediction. These conclusions are based on eight physicochemical data sets, each with a significant number of compounds comparable to that usually used in the QSAR/QSPR modeling. The superiority of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is revealed in terms of functional dependence of the change of the neural network weights with respect to the gradient of the error propagation as well as distribution of the weight values. The prediction of the models is assessed by the error of the validation sets not used in the training process.

AB Objective. Computational models are powerful tools that can enable the optimization of deep brain stimulation (DBS). To enhance the clinical practicality of these models, their computational expense and required technical expertise must be minimized. An important aspect of DBS models is the prediction of neural activation in response to electrical stimulation. Existing rapid predictors of activation simplify implementation and reduce prediction runtime, but at the expense of accuracy. We sought to address this issue by leveraging the speed and generalization abilities of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to create a novel predictor of neural fiber activation in response to DBS. Approach. We developed six variations of an ANN-based predictor to predict the response of individual, myelinated axons to extracellular electrical stimulation. ANNs were trained using datasets generated from a finite-element model of an implanted DBS system together with multi-compartment cable models of axons. We evaluated the ANN-based predictors using three white matter pathways derived from group-averaged connectome data within a patient-specific tissue conductivity field, comparing both predicted stimulus activation thresholds and pathway recruitment across a clinically relevant range of stimulus amplitudes and pulse widths. Main results. The top-performing ANN could predict the thresholds of axons with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.037 V, and pathway recruitment with an MAE of 0.079%, across all parameters. The ANNs reduced the time required to predict the thresholds of 288 axons by four to five orders of magnitude when compared to multi-compartment cable models. Significance. We demonstrated that ANNs can be fast, accurate, and robust predictors of neural activation in response to DBS.

TI GPU COMPUTATION OF THE EULER CHARACTERISTIC CURVE FOR IMAGING DATA
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL GEOMETRY
LA English
DT Article
AB Persistent homology is perhaps the most popular and useful tool offered by topological data analysis - with point-cloud data being the most common setup. Its older cousin, the Euler characteristic curve (ECC) is less expressive - and far easier to compute. It is particularly suitable for analyzing imaging data, and is commonly used in fields ranging from astrophysics to biomedical image analysis. These fields are embracing GPU computations to handle increasingly large datasets.We therefore propose an optimized GPU implementation of ECC computation for 2D and 3D grayscale images. The goal of this paper is twofold. First, we offer a practical tool, illustrating its performance with thorough experimentation - but also explain its inherent shortcomings. Second, this simple algorithm serves as a perfect backdrop for highlighting basic GPU programming techniques that make our implementation so efficient - and some common pitfalls we avoided. This is intended as a step towards a wider usage of GPU programming in computational geometry and topology software. We find this is particularly important as geometric and topological tools are used in conjunction with modern, GPU-accelerated machine learning frameworks.

AB Multivariate neural data provide the basis for assessing interactions in brain networks. Among myriad connectivity measures, Granger causality (GC) has proven to be statistically intuitive, easy to implement, and generate meaningful results. Although its application to functional MRI (fMRI) data is increasing, several factors have been identified that appear to hinder its neural interpretability: (a) latency differences in hemodynamic response function (HRF) across different brain regions, (b) low-sampling rates, and (c) noise. Recognizing that in basic and clinical neuroscience, it is often the change of a dependent variable (e.g., GC) between experimental conditions and between normal and pathology that is of interest, we address the question of whether there exist systematic relationships between GC at the fMRI level and that at the neural level. Simulated neural signals were convolved with a canonical HRF, down-sampled, and noise-added to generate simulated fMRI data. As the coupling parameters in the model were varied, fMRI GC and neural GC were calculated, and their relationship examined. Three main results were found: (1) GC following HRF convolution is a monotonically increasing function of neural GC; (2) this monotonicity can be reliably detected as a positive correlation when realistic fMRI temporal resolution and noise level were used; and (3) although the detectability of monotonicity declined due to the presence of HRF latency differences, substantial recovery of detectability occurred after correcting for latency differences. These results suggest that Granger causality is a viable technique for analyzing fMRI data when the questions are appropriately formulated.

AB The main challenge for adaptive regulation of linear-quadratic systems is the tradeoff between identification and control. An adaptive policy needs to address both the estimation of unknown dynamics parameters (exploration), as well as the regulation of the underlying system (exploitation). To this end, optimism-based methods that bias the identification in favor of optimistic approximations of the true parameter are employed in the literature. A number of asymptotic results have been established, but their finite-time counterparts are few, with important restrictions. This article establishes results for the worst-case regret of optimism-based adaptive policies. The presented high probability upper bounds are optimal up to logarithmic factors. The nonasymptotic analysis of this article requires the following very mild assumptions: stabilizability of the system's dynamics, and limiting the degree of heaviness of the noise distribution. To establish such bounds, certain novel techniques are developed to comprehensively address the probabilistic behavior of dependent random matrices with heavy-tailed distributions.

AB This article presents a fused approach to counterfeit integrated circuit (IC) detection by synergistically combining the resonant cavity system (ResCav) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. ResCav excels in discerning structural alterations, proven by its ability to mimic and surpass X-ray imaging results, making it ideal for identifying recycled, cloned, repackaged, and tampered ICs. On the other hand, FTIR's precision in detecting subtle material variations positions it as a prime candidate for uncovering remarked ICs. The integrated ResCav and FTIR system forms a robust dual-modality approach, broadening the scope of detection and reducing false positives. This research not only fortifies defenses against current deceptive practices but also contributes to anticipating and thwarting future illicit endeavors in the dynamic landscape of electronic component security. The adoption of dual-modalities holds significant implications for enhancing security measures, ensuring sustained integrity, and reliability in electronic systems.

DE Limited memory BFGS (L-BFGS); stochastic optimization; secant equation
ID APPROXIMATION
AB In this paper, a new limited memory BFGS is proposed for solving stochastic optimization problems. Since the cost of storing and manipulating H-k is prohibitive in the large scale setting, the LBFGS algorithms use the strategy of keeping the most recent correction pairs. Besides, in the stochastic regime, due to some noisy information in both gradient vector and Hessian approximation, the second-order model is not an accurate estimation of the function. To overcome this problem, our L-BFGS employs memory in an optimal manner by storing the correction pairs that have the least violation in the secant equation. Under some standard assumptions, the convergence property of the new algorithm is established for strongly convex functions. Numerical results on the problems arising in machine learning show that the new method is competitive and effective in practice.

AB Physiatry is a medical specialty focused on improving functional outcomes in patients with a variety of medical conditions that affect the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves, muscles, bones, joints, ligaments, and tendons. Social determinants of health (SDH) play a key role in determining therapeutic process and patient functional outcomes. Big data and precision medicine have been used in other fields and to some extent in physiatry to predict patient outcomes, however many challenges remain. The interplay between SDH and physiatry outcomes is highly variable depending on different phases of care, and more favorable patient profiles in acute care may be less favorable in the outpatient setting. Furthermore, SDH influence which treatments or interventional procedures are accessible to the patient and thus determine outcomes. This opinion paper describes utility of existing datasets in combination with novel data such as movement, gait patterning and patient perceived outcomes could be analyzed with artificial intelligence methods to determine the best treatment plan for individual patients in order to achieve maximal functional capacity.

AB The pedosphere is the largest terrestrial reservoir of organic carbon, yet soil-carbon variability and its representation in Earth system models is a large source of uncertainty for carbon-cycle science and climate projections. Much of this uncertainty is attributed to local and regional-scale variability, and predicting this variation can be challenging if variable selection is based solely on a priori assumptions due to the scale-dependent nature of environmental determinants. Data mining can optimize predictive modeling by allowing machine-learning algorithms to learn from and discover complex patterns in large datasets that may have otherwise gone unnoticed, thus increasing the potential for knowledge discovery. In this analysis, we identify important, regional-scale determinants for top- and subsoil-carbon stabilization in production forestland across the southeastern US. Specifically, we apply recursive feature elimination to a large suite of socio-environmental data to strategically select a parsimonious, yet highly predictive covariate set. This is achieved by recursively considering smaller and smaller covariate sets-or features-by first training the estimator on the full set to obtain feature importance. The least important features are pruned, and the procedure is recursively repeated until a desired number of covariates is identified. We show that although carbon ranges from 0.3 to 8.2 kg m(-2) in the topsoil (0 to 20 cm), and from 0.4 to 17.6 kg m(-2) in the subsoil (20 to 100 cm), this variability is predictably distributed with precipitation, soil moisture, nitrogen and sand content, gamma ray emissions, mean annual minimum temperature, and elevation. From our spatial predictions, we estimate that 2.6 Pg of soil carbon is currently stabilized in the upper 100 cm of production forestland, which covers 34.7 million ha in the southeastern US.

AB We introduce the Hierarchically Interacting Particle Neural Network (HIP-NN) to model molecular properties from datasets of quantum calculations. Inspired by a many-body expansion, HIP-NN decomposes properties, such as energy, as a sum over hierarchical terms. These terms are generated from a neural network-a composition of many nonlinear transformations-acting on a representation of the molecule. HIP-NN achieves the state-of-the-art perfo(r)mance on a dataset of 131k ground state organic molecules and predicts energies with 0.26 kcal/mol mean absolute error. With minimal tuning, our model is also competitive on a dataset of molecular dynamics trajectories. In addition to enabling accurate energy predictions, the hierarchical structure of HIP-NN helps to identify regions of model uncertainty. Published by AIP Publishing.

TI Equivariant neural networks for robust CP observables
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D

DT Article
AB We introduce the usage of equivariant neural networks in the search for violations of the charge-parity (CP) symmetry in particle interactions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. We design neural networks that take as inputs kinematic information of recorded events and that transform equivariantly under a symmetry group related to the CP transformation. We show that this algorithm allows one to define observables reflecting the properties of the CP symmetry, showcasing its performance in several reference processes in top quark and electroweak physics. Imposing equivariance as an inductive bias in the algorithm improves the numerical convergence properties with respect to other methods that do not rely on equivariance and allows one to construct optimal observables that significantly improve the state-of-the-art methodology in the searches considered.

AB Rapid diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is crucial for optimal patient management. Accurate diagnosis and time of onset of an acute event can influence treatment plans, such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). PCI is most beneficial within 3 hours of AMI onset. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are promising biomarkers, with potential of early AMI diagnosis, since they are released before cell death and subsequent release of larger molecules [e.g., cardiac troponins (cTn)], and have greater sensitivity and stability in plasma versus cTn regardless of timing of AMI onset. However, miRNA-based AMI diagnosis can result in false positives due to miRNA content overlap between AMI and stable coronary artery disease (CAD). Accordingly, we explored the possibility of using a miRNA profile, rather than a single miRNA, to distinguish between CAD and AMI, as well as different stages following AMI onset. First we screened a library of 800 miRNA using plasma samples from 4 patient cohorts; no known CAD, CAD, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and STEMI followed by PCI, using Nanostring miRNA profiling technology. From this screening, based on machine learning SCAD and Lasso algorithms, we identified 9 biomarkers (miR-200b, miR-543, miR-331, miR-3605, miR-301a, miR-18a, miR-423, miR-142, and miR-132) that were differentially expressed in CAD, STEMI and STEMI-PCI and explored them to identify a miRNA profile for rapid and accurate AMI diagnosis. These 9 miRNAs were selected as the most frequently identified targets by SCAD and Lasso, as indicated in the "drum-plot" model in the machine learning approach. We used age-matched patient samples to validate selected 9 miRNA biomarkers using a multiplexed ion-exchange membrane-based miRNA sensor platform, which measures specific miRNAs, and cTn as a control, simultaneously as a point-of-care device. Findings from this study will inform timely and accurate diagnosis of AMI and its stages, which are essential for effective management and optimal patient outcomes.
   Rapid diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is crucial for optimal patient management.

AB Health system data incompletely capture the social risk factors for drug overdose. This study aimed to improve the accuracy of a machine-learning algorithm to predict opioid overdose risk by integrating human services and criminal justice data with health claims data to capture the social determinants of overdose risk. This prognostic study included Medicaid beneficiaries (n = 237,259) in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania enrolled between 2015 and 2018, randomly divided into training, testing, and validation samples. We measured 290 potential predictors (239 derived from Medicaid claims data) in 30-day periods, beginning with the first observed Medicaid enrollment date during the study period. Using a gradient boosting machine, we predicted a composite outcome (i.e., fatal or nonfatal opioid overdose constructed using medical examiner and claims data) in the subsequent month. We compared prediction performance between a Medicaid claims only model to one integrating human services and criminal justice data with Medicaid claims (i.e., integrated model) using several metrics (e.g., C-statistic, number needed to evaluate [NNE] to identify one overdose). Beneficiaries were stratified into risk-score decile subgroups. The samples (training = 79,087, testing = 79,086, validation = 79,086) had similar characteristics (age = 38 +/- 18 years, female = 56%, white = 48%, having at least one overdose = 1.7% during study period). Using the validation sample, the integrated model slightly improved on the Medicaid claims only model (C-statistic = 0.885; 95%CI = 0.877-0.892 vs. C-statistic = 0.871; 95%CI = 0.863-0.878), with small corresponding improvements in the NNE and positive predictive value. Nine of the top 30 most important predictors in the integrated model were human services and criminal justice variables. Using the integrated model, approximately 70% of individuals with overdoses were members of the top risk decile (overdose rates in the subsequent month = 47/10,000 beneficiaries). Few individuals in the bottom 9 deciles had overdose episodes (0-12/10,000). Machine-learning algorithms integrating claims and social service and criminal justice data modestly improved opioid overdose prediction among Medicaid beneficiaries for a large U.S. county heavily affected by the opioid crisis.

AB Swallow is defined as the coordinated neuromuscular activity of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, and esophagus. Movement of a bolus and air must be coordinated by swallow remodeling of the respiratory pattern. The brainstem contains respiratory and swallow neural control networks that generate the pattern for breathing and swallow. Swallow control of respiration is proposed to be through recruitment of swallow neural elements that retask existing respiratory neural network elements. Swallow reconfiguration of the respiratory neural network is fundamental to airway protection and integrated with other airway protective reflexes. Thus, swallow, breathing, cough, and other airway defensive behaviors are produced by a central neural motor system that shares elements. It is hypothesized that swallow and airway defensive behaviors are controlled by a recruited behavioral control assembly system that is organized in a fashion that allows for precise coordination of the expression of these behaviors to maintain airway protection.

AB As a robust nonlinear similarity measure in kernel space, correntropy has received increasing attention in domains of machine learning and signal processing. In particular, the maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) has recently been successfully applied in robust regression and filtering. The default kernel function in correntropy is the Gaussian kernel, which is, of course, not always the best choice. In this paper, we propose a generalized correntropy that adopts the generalized Gaussian density (GGD) function as the kernel, and present some important properties. We further propose the generalized maximum correntropy criterion (GMCC) and apply it to adaptive filtering. An adaptive algorithm, called the GMCC algorithm, is derived, and the stability problem and steady-state performance are studied. We show that the proposed algorithm is very stable and can achieve zero probability of divergence (POD). Simulation results confirm the theoretical expectations and demonstrate the desirable performance of the new algorithm.

AB Medical education faces the dual challenge of addressing cognitive overload and sustaining student engagement, particularly in complex subjects such as pharmacology. This study introduces Cinematic Clinical Narratives (CCNs) as an innovative approach to teaching antiparasitic pharmacology, combining generative artificial intelligence (genAI), edutainment, and mnemonic-based learning. The intervention involved two short films, Alien: Parasites Within and Wormquest, designed to teach antiparasitic pharmacology to first-year medical students. A control group of students only received traditional text-based clinical cases, while the experimental group engaged with the CCNs in an active learning environment. Students who received the CCN material scored an average of 8% higher on exam questions related to the material covered by the CCN compared to students in the control group. Results also showed that the CCNs improved engagement and interest among students, as evidenced by significantly higher scores on the Situational Interest Survey for Multimedia (SIS-M) compared to traditional methods. Notably, students preferred CCNs for their storytelling, visuals, and interactive elements. This study underscores the potential of CCNs as a supplementary educational tool, and suggests the potential for broader applications across other medical disciplines outside of antiparasitic pharmacology. By leveraging genAI and edutainment, CCNs represent a scalable and innovative approach to enhancing the medical learning experience.

AB Prostate cancer is the most common noncutaneous cancer and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among American men. Statins and omega-3 are two medications recently found to correlate with prostate cancer risk and aggressiveness, but the observed associations are complex and controversial. We therefore explore the novel application of radiomics in studying statin and omega-3 usage in prostate cancer patients. On MRIs of 91 prostate cancer patients, two regions of interest (ROIs), the whole prostate and the peripheral region of the prostate, were manually segmented. From each ROI, 944 radiomic features were extracted after field bias correction and normalization. Heatmaps were generated to study the radiomic feature patterns against statin or omega-3 usage. Radiomics models were trained on selected features and evaluated with 500-round threefold cross-validation for each drug/ROI combination. On the 1500 validation datasets, the radiomics model achieved average AUCs of 0.70, 0.74, 0.78, and 0.72 for omega-3/prostate, omega-3/peripheral, statin/prostate, and statin/peripheral, respectively. As the first study to analyze radiomics in relation to statin and omega-3 uses in prostate cancer patients, our study preliminarily established the existence of imaging-identifiable tissue-level changes in the prostate and illustrated the potential usefulness of radiomics for further exploring these medications' effects and mechanisms in prostate cancer.

AB Many specific problems within the domain of high throughput phenotyping require the accurate localization of plant organs. To track and count plant organs, we propose GCNNMatch++, a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) that is capable of online tracking objects from videos. Based upon the GCNNMatch tracker with an improved CensNet GNN, our end-to-end tracking approach achieves fast inference. In order to adapt this approach to flower counting, we collected a large, high-quality dataset of cotton flower videos by leveraging our custom-built MARS-X robotic platform. Specifically, our system can count cotton flowers in the field with 80% accuracy, achieving a Higher-Order Tracking Accuracy (HOTA) of 51.09 and outperforming more generic tracking methods. Without any optimization (such as employing TensorRT), our association model runs in 44 ms on a central processing unit (CPU). On appropriate hardware, our model holds promise for achieving real-time counting performance when coupled with a fast detector. Overall, our approach is useful in counting cotton flowers and other relevant plant organs for both breeding programs and yield estimation.

AB Restricted, repetitive behaviors (RRBs) are patterns of behavior that exhibit little variation in form and have no obvious function. RRBs although transdiagonstic are a particularly prominent feature of certain neurodevelopmental disorders, yet relatively little is known about the neural circuitry of RRBs. Past work in this area has focused on isolated brain regions and neurotransmitter systems, but implementing a neural circuit approach has the potential to greatly improve understanding of RRBs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is well-suited to studying the structural and functional connectivity of the nervous system, and is a highly translational research tool. In this review, we synthesize MRI research from both neurodevelopmental disorders and relevant animal models that informs the neural circuitry of RRB. Together, these studies implicate distributed neural circuits between the cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. Despite progress in neuroimaging of RRB, there are many opportunities for conceptual and methodological improvement. We conclude by suggesting future directions for MRI research in RRB, and how such studies can benefit from complementary approaches in neuroscience.

AB Background: Identification of motifs and quantification of their occurrences are important for the study of genetic diseases, gene evolution, transcription sites, and other biological mechanisms. Exact formulae for estimating count distributions of motifs under Markovian assumptions have high computational complexity and are impractical to be used on large motif sets. Approximated formulae, e.g. based on compound Poisson, are faster, but reliable p value calculation remains challenging. Here, we introduce 'motif_prob', a fast implementation of an exact formula for motif count distribution through progressive approximation with arbitrary precision. Our implementation speeds up the exact calculation, usually impractical, making it feasible and posit to substitute currently employed heuristics.
   Results: We implement motif_prob in both Perl and C++ languages, using an efficient error-bound iterative process for the exact formula, providing comparison with state-of-the-art tools (e.g. MoSDi) in terms of precision, run time benchmarks, along with a real-world use case on bacterial motif characterization. Our software is able to process a million of motifs (13-31 bases) over genome lengths of 5 million bases within the minute on a regular laptop, and the run times for both the Perl and C++ code are several orders of magnitude smaller (50-1000xfaster) than MoSDi, even when using their fast compound Poisson approximation (60-120xfaster). In the real-world use cases, we first show the consistency of motif_prob with MoSDi, and then how the p-value quantification is crucial for enrichment quantification when bacteria have different GC content, using motifs found in antimicrobial resistance genes. The software and the code sources are available under the MIT license at https://github.com/DataIntellSystLab/motif_prob.
   Conclusions: The motif_prob software is a multi-platform and efficient open source solution for calculating exact frequency distributions of motifs. It can be integrated with motif discovery/characterization tools for quantifying enrichment and deviation from expected frequency ranges with exact p values, without loss in data processing efficiency.

AB Microarray gene expression data-based tumor classification is an active and challenging issue. In this paper, an integrated tumor classification framework is presented, which aims to exploit information in existing available samples, and focuses on the small sample problem and unbalanced classification problem. Firstly, an inverse space sparse representation based classification (ISSRC) model is proposed by considering the characteristics of gene-based tumor data, such as sparsity and a small number of training samples. A decision information factors (DIF)-based gene selection method is constructed to enhance the representation ability of the ISSRC. It is worth noting that the DIF is established from reducing clinical misdiagnosis rate and dimension of small sample data. For further improving the representation ability and classification stability of the ISSRC, feature learning is conducted on the selected gene subset. The feature learning method is constructed by complementing the advantages of non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and deep learning. Without confusion, the ISSRC combined with gene selection and feature learning is called the integrated ISSRC, whose stability, optimization and the corresponding convergence are analyzed. Extensive experiments on six public microarray gene expression datasets show the integrated ISSRC-based tumor classification framework is superior to classical and state-of-the-art methods. There are significant improvements in classification accuracy, specificity and sensitivity, whether there is a tumor in the early diagnosis, what kind of tumor, or whether metastasis occurs after tumor surgery.

AB Understanding the nature and origin of collective excitations in materials is of fundamental importance for unraveling the underlying physics of a many-body system. Excitation spectra are usually obtained by measuring the dynamical structure factor, S(Q, omega), using inelastic neutron or x-ray scattering techniques and are analyzed by comparing the experimental results against calculated predictions. We introduce a data-driven analysis tool which leverages 'neural implicit representations' that are specifically tailored for handling spectrographic measurements and are able to efficiently obtain unknown parameters from experimental data via automatic differentiation. In this work, we employ linear spin wave theory simulations to train a machine learning platform, enabling precise exchange parameter extraction from inelastic neutron scattering data on the square-lattice spin-1 antiferromagnet La2NiO4, showcasing a viable pathway towards automatic refinement of advanced models for ordered magnetic systems.
   Analysis of experimental data in condensed matter is often challenging due to system complexity and slow character of physical simulations. The authors propose a framework that combines machine learning with theoretical calculations to enable real-time analysis for electron, neutron, and x-ray spectroscopies.

AB Because of high dimensionality, correlation among covariates, and noise contained in data, dimension reduction (DR) techniques are often employed to the application of machine learning algorithms. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and their kernel variants (KPCA, KLDA) are among the most popular DR methods. Recently, Supervised Kernel Principal Component Analysis (SKPCA) has been shown as another successful alternative. In this paper, brief reviews of these popular techniques are presented first. We then conduct a comparative performance study based on three simulated datasets, after which the performance of the techniques are evaluated through application to a pattern recognition problem in face image analysis. The gender classification problem is considered on MORPH-II and FG-NET, two popular longitudinal face aging databases. Several feature extraction methods are used, including biologically-inspired features (BIF), local binary patterns (LBP), histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), and the Active Appearance Model (AAM). After applications of DR methods, a linear support vector machine (SVM) is deployed with gender classification accuracy rates exceeding 95% on MORPH-II, competitive with benchmark results. A parallel computational approach is also proposed, attaining faster processing speeds and similar recognition rates on MORPH-II. Our computational approach can be applied to practical gender classification systems and generalized to other face analysis tasks, such as race classification and age prediction.

AB Activity recognition has received increasing attention from the machine learning community. Of particular interest is the ability to recognize activities in real time from streaming data, but this presents a number of challenges not faced by traditional offline approaches. Among these challenges is handling the large amount of data that does not belong to a predefined class. In this paper, we describe a method by which activity discovery can be used to identify behavioral patterns in observational data. Discovering patterns in the data that does not belong to a predefined class aids in understanding this data and segmenting it into learnable classes. We demonstrate that activity discovery not only sheds light on behavioral patterns, but it can also boost the performance of recognition algorithms. We introduce this partnership between activity discovery and online activity recognition in the context of the CASAS smart home project and validate our approach using CASAS data sets.

AB Over the past two decades, globalized outsourcing in the semiconductor supply chain has lowered manufacturing costs and shortened the time-to-market for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). However, such outsourcing has rendered the printed circuit boards (PCBs) vulnerable to malicious activities and alterations on a global scale. In this article, we take an in-depth look into one such attack, called the "Big I lack," that was recently reported by Bloomberg Buisnessweek. The article provides background on the Big Hack from three perspectives: an attacker, a security investigator, and the societal impacts. This study provides details on vulnerabilities in the modem PCB supply chain, the possible attacks, and the existing and emerging countermeasures. The necessity for novel visual inspection techniques for PCB assurance is emphasized throughout the article. Further, a review of various imaging modalities, image analysis algorithms, and open research challenges are provided for automated visual inspection.

ID DESIGN
AB The stereolithography (SL) process, although a relatively new technology, has revolutionized the domain of part and process research and development.(1-3) SL is used to produce parts for various purposes throughout the aerospace, automotive, electronics, and biomedical products industries, as well as many others. The applications for stereolithography parts include design verification models, methods and tool development models, casting models, and marketing aids. Its success in a myriad of applications has unfortunately often resulted in a production backlog for many SL machines. In addition, because the technology is new, and technological improvements have occurred quickly and involve such drastic changes, most client companies are using SL in suboptimized ways, resulting in less than maximum throughput and with nonpeak geometric and physical properties.
   A systematic but efficient use of experimental design can help companies more quickly advance up the learning curve and to increase their throughput of SL parts. This can be done with relatively little testing, and the payback is well worth the money and time invested.

SO NATURE MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Despite the increasing adoption of insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring devices, most people with type 1 diabetes do not achieve their glycemic goals(1). This could be related to a lack of expertise or inadequate time for clinicians to analyze complex sensor-augmented pump data. We tested whether frequent insulin dose adjustments guided by an automated artificial intelligence-based decision support system (AI-DSS) is as effective and safe as those guided by physicians in controlling glucose levels. ADVICE4U was a six-month, multicenter, multinational, parallel, randomized controlled, non-inferiority trial in 108 participants with type 1 diabetes, aged 10-21 years and using insulin pump therapy (ClinicalTrials.gov no. NCT03003806). Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive remote insulin dose adjustment every three weeks guided by either an AI-DSS, (AI-DSS arm, n=54) or by physicians (physician arm, n=54). The results for the primary efficacy measure-the percentage of time spent within the target glucose range (70-180mgdl(-1) (3.9-10.0mmoll(-1)))-in the AI-DSS arm were statistically non-inferior to those in the physician arm (50.211.1% versus 51.6 +/- 11.3%, respectively, P<1x10(-7)). The percentage of readings below 54mgdl(-1) (<3.0mmoll(-1)) within the AI-DSS arm was statistically non-inferior to that in the physician arm (1.3 +/- 1.4% versus 1.0 +/- 0.9%, respectively, P<0.0001). Three severe adverse events related to diabetes (two severe hypoglycemia, one diabetic ketoacidosis) were reported in the physician arm and none in the AI-DSS arm. In conclusion, use of an automated decision support tool for optimizing insulin pump settings was non-inferior to intensive insulin titration provided by physicians from specialized academic diabetes centers.The randomized-controlled trial ADVICE4U demonstrates non-inferiority of an automated AI-based decision support system compared with advice from expert physicians for optimal insulin dosing in youths with type 1 diabetes.

AB Intricate networks of single-celled eukaryotes (protists) dominate carbon flow in the ocean. Their growth, demise, and interactions with other microorganisms drive the fluxes of biogeochemical elements through marine ecosystems. Mixotrophic protists are capable of both photosynthesis and ingestion of prey and are dominant components of open-ocean planktonic communities. Yet the role of mixotrophs in elemental cycling is obscured by their capacity to act as primary producers or heterotrophic consumers depending on factors that remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we develop and apply a machine learning model that predicts the in situ trophic mode of aquatic protists based on their patterns of gene expression. This approach leverages a public collection of protist transcriptomes as a training set to identify a subset of gene families whose transcriptional profiles predict trophic mode. We applied our model to nearly 100 metatranscriptomes obtained during two oceanographic cruises in the North Pacific and found community-level and population-specific evidence that abundant open-ocean mixotrophic populations shift their predominant mode of nutrient and carbon acquisition in response to natural gradients in nutrient supply and sea surface temperature. Metatranscriptomic data from ship-board incubation experiments revealed that abundant mixotrophic prymnesiophytes from the oligotrophic North Pacific subtropical gyre rapidly remodeled their transcriptome to enhance photosynthesis when supplied with limiting nutrients. Coupling this approach with experiments designed to reveal the mechanisms driving mixotroph physiology provides an avenue toward understanding the ecology of mixotrophy in the natural environment.

AB Recognition and detection of green immature citrus fruit more accurately and efficiently in groves under natural illumination conditions provides a promising benefit for growers to plan application of nutrients during the fruit maturing stages and estimate their yield and profit prior to the harvesting period. The goal of this study was to develop a robust and fast algorithm to detect and count immature green citrus fruit in individual trees from colour images acquired with different fruit sizes and under various illumination conditions. Adaptive Red and Blue chromatic map (ARB) was created and combined with the Hue image extracted after histogram equalization (HEH). The sum of absolute transformed difference (SATD), a block-matching method, was applied to detect potential fruit pixels. After OR operation of the results obtained from colour and SATD analysis which kept as many fruit pixels as possible, a kernel support vector machine (SVM) classifier was built with same learning sets used for different classification stages to remove false positives based on five selected texture features. The algorithm was evaluated with a set of testing images, and achieved more than 83% recognition accuracy. The proposed method can provide a more efficient way for green citrus identification in a grove using colour images. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The brain is designed not only with molecules and cellular processes that help to form memories but also with molecules and cellular processes that suppress the formation and retention of memory. The latter processes are critical for an efficient memory management system, given the vast amount of information that each person experiences in their daily activities and that most of this information becomes irrelevant with time. Thus, efficiency dictates that the brain should have processes for selecting the most critical information for storage and suppressing the irrelevant or forgetting it later should it escape the initial filters. Such memory suppressor molecules and processes are revealed by genetic or pharmacologic insults that lead to enhanced memory expression. We review here the predominant memory suppressor molecules and processes that have recently been discovered. They are diverse, as expected, because the brain is complex and employs many different strategies and mechanisms to form memories. They include the gene-repressive actions of small noncoding RNAs, repressors of protein synthesis, cAMP-mediated gene expression pathways, inter- and intracellular signaling pathways for normal forgetting, and others. A deep understanding of memory suppressor molecules and processes is necessary to fully comprehend how the brain forms, stabilizes, and retrieves memories and to reveal how brain disorders disrupt memory.

AB Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) aim to bypass the peripheral nervous system to link the brain to external devices via successful modeling of decoding mechanisms. BCI based on electrocorticogram or ECoG represent a viable compromise between clinical practicality, spatial resolution, and signal quality when it comes to extracellular electrical potentials from local neuronal assemblies. Classic analysis of ECoG traces usually falls under the umbrella of Time-Frequency decompositions with adaptations from Fourier analysis and wavelets as its most prominent variants. However, analyzing such high-dimensional, multivariate time series demands for specialized signal processing and neurophysiological principles. We propose a generative model for single-channel ECoGs that is able to fully characterize reoccurring rhythm-specific neuromodulations as weighted activations of prototypical templates over time. The set of timings, weights and indexes comprise a temporal marked point process (TMPP) that accesses a set of bases from vector spaces of different dimensions-a dictionary. The shallow nature of the model admits the equivalence between latent variables and representations. In this way, learning the model parameters is a case of unsupervised representation learning. We exploit principles of Minimum Description Length (MDL) encoding to effectively yield a data-driven framework where prototypical neuromodulations (not restricted to a particular duration) can be estimated alongside the timings and features of the TMPP. We validate the proposed methodology on discrimination of movement-related tasks utilizing 32-electrode grids implanted in the frontal cortex of six epileptic subjects. We show that the learned representations from the high-gamma band (85-145 Hz) are not only interpretable, but also discriminant in a lower dimensional space. The results also underscore the practicality of our algorithm, i.e., 2 main hyperparameters that can be readily set via neurophysiology, and emphasize the need of principled and interpretable representation learning in order to model encoding mechanisms in the brain.

AB Venetian blinds play an important role in controlling daylight in buildings Automated blinds overcome some limitations of manual blinds however the existing automated systems mainly control the direct solar radiation and glare and cannot be used for controlling innovative blind systems such as split blinds This research developed an Illuminance-based Slat Angle Selection (ISAS) model that predicts the optimum slat angles of split blinds to achieve the designed indoor illuminance The model was constructed based on a series of multi-layer feed-forward artificial neural networks (ANNs) The illuminance values at the sensor points used to develop the ANNs were obtained by the software EnergyPlus (TM) The weather determinants (such as horizontal illuminance and sun angles) were used as the input variables for the ANNs The illuminance level at a sensor point was the output variable for the ANNs The ISAS model was validated by evaluating the errors in the calculation of the 1) illuminance and 2) optimum slat angles The validation results showed that the power of the ISAS model to predict illuminance was 94 7% while its power to calculate the optimum slat angles was 98 5% For about 90% of time in the year the illuminance percentage errors were less than 10% and the percentage errors in calculating the optimum slat angles were less than 5% This research offers a new approach for the automated control of split blinds and a guide for future research to utilize the adaptive nature of ANNs to develop a more practical and applicable blind control system (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB BackgroundLearning distributional representation of clinical concepts (e.g., diseases, drugs, and labs) is an important research area of deep learning in the medical domain. However, many existing relevant methods do not consider temporal dependencies along the longitudinal sequence of a patient's records, which may lead to incorrect selection of contexts.MethodsTo address this issue, we extended three popular concept embedding learning methods: word2vec, positive pointwise mutual information (PPMI) and FastText, to consider time-sensitive information. We then trained them on a large electronic health records (EHR) database containing about 50 million patients to generate concept embeddings and evaluated them for both intrinsic evaluations focusing on concept similarity measure and an extrinsic evaluation to assess the use of generated concept embeddings in the task of predicting disease onset.ResultsOur experiments show that embeddings learned from information within one visit (time window zero) improve performance on the concept similarity measure and the FastText algorithm usually had better performance than the other two algorithms. For the predictive modeling task, the optimal result was achieved by word2vec embeddings with a 30-day sliding window.ConclusionsConsidering time constraints are important in training clinical concept embeddings. We expect they can benefit a series of downstream applications.

AB Objective: Septic shock is a life-threatening manifestation of infection with a mortality of 20-50% [1]. A catecholamine vasopressor, norepinephrine (NE), is widely used to treat septic shock primarily by increasing blood pressure. For this reason, future blood pressure knowledge is invaluable for properly controlling NE infusion rates in septic patients. However, recent machine learning and data-driven methods often treat the physiological effects of NE as a black box. In this paper, a real-time, physiology-informed human mean arterial blood pressure model for septic shock patients undergoing NE infusion is studied. Methods: Our methods combine learning theory, adaptive filter theory, and physiology. We learn least mean square adaptive filters to predict three physiological parameters (heart rate, pulse pressure, and the product of total arterial compliance and arterial resistance) from previous data and previous NE infusion rate. These predictions are combined according to a physiology model to predict future mean arterial blood pressure. Results: Our model successfully forecasts mean arterial blood pressure on 30 septic patients from two databases. Specifically, we predict mean arterial blood pressure 3.33 minutes to 20 minutes into the future with a root mean square error from 3.56 mmHg to 6.22 mmHg. Additionally, we compare the computational cost of different models and discover a correlation between learned NE response models and a patient's SOFA score. Conclusion: Our approach advances our capability to predict the effects of changing NE infusion rates in septic patients. Significance: More accurately predicted MAP can lessen clinicians' workload and reduce error in NE titration.

AB Mineralogical assessments of carbonates are widely used in environmental and diagenetic studies as well as to identify well-preserved archives for the reconstruction of past climate. Efforts to improve the quantification of phases in biogenic carbonates are ongoing and critical to accurately interpreting paleoclimate data. X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a standard quantitative mineralogical tool for many applications, but previous studies vary in their precision and determination of errors. Here we present a quantitative bimodal XRD calibration of marine, biogenic carbonates that we developed to assess the relative amounts of aragonite, low-Mg calcite, and high-Mg calcite in fossil coral samples. We compare the accuracy and precision of an ordinary-least-squares and a weighted-least-squares regression technique for low-concentration standard mixtures, and extend this comparison to two other published calibration studies. We also compare a polynomial fit and a spline fit for an overall calibration regression. The calibrations in this study are then compared with a model calibration using synthetic XRD data to test for sources of bias and uncertainty in the experimental calibrations. This test leads us to conclude that variation in the grain size and crystallinity of a natural aragonite standard is one source of uncertainty in these calibrations. Reproducibility of standard peak-area ratios has the largest control on calibration precision and limits of decision, detection, and quantification. Calibration accuracy is determined by the slope of the model regressions, which may be influenced by a number of factors, including mineralogical-standard crystallinity. Based on these results we include a set of best practices for XRD calibration procedures that arc dependent on the carbonate phase and precision requirements of the end-user's sample assessment. This method is made available and reproducible with an open-source R programming language code in GitHub and represents a robust procedure for bimodal quantitative mineralogical assessment in biogenic carbonates, with wide-ranging applications to environmental studies.

AB By conventional spike count measures, auditory neurons in the cat's anterior ectosylvian sulcus cortical area are broadly tuned for the location of a sound source. Nevertheless, an artificial neural network was trained to classify the temporal spike patterns of single neurons according to sound location. The spike patterns of 73 percent of single neurons coded sound location with more than twice the chance level of accuracy, and spike patterns consistently carried more information than spike counts alone. In contrast to neurons that are sharply tuned for location, these neurons appear to encode sound locations throughout 360 degrees of azimuth.

AB Monitoring of wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) females to obtain representative measures of apparent nesting and nest survival rates has long been an important component of wild turkey management. In the interest of improving estimates of apparent nesting and nest survival rates, we assessed the feasibility of inferring reproductive behavior of wild turkeys from remotely acquired movement data. We ascertained detailed nesting stage chronologies using Global Positioning System (GPS) data downloaded from 44 females fitted with transmitters that had both a very high frequency (VHF) beacon and a GPS logger. Then we tracked females using VHF to confirm nest locations and nest fate in north and north-central Florida. Using twice hourly GPS derived locations, we evaluated 3 predictive machine learning models (Chi-squared automatic interactive detection [CHAID], exhaustive CHAID, and multivariate adaptive regression splines [MARSpline]) for their ability to accurately classify nesting behaviors (laying and incubating stages) that were confirmed via visual inspection of all potential nest sites. Incubation stage was readily identifiable by the spatial signatures present in each female's GPS-based movement track across all models (up to 92% true positive and as low as 8% false positives in exhaustive CHAID models), whereas the laying stage was more difficult to identify (up to 65% true positive and as low as 35% false positives in exhaustive CHAID models). Daily averages of movement metrics generally achieved better performance in predictive models than data sets with more frequent sampling (i.e., 30-minute daytime locations). Our results indicated that exhaustive CHAID models performed best in identifying nesting stages, using movement metrics from GPS data. With continued development, these models may facilitate and improve large-scale wild turkey monitoring.

AB We propose the use of optimized brain-machine interface (BMI) models for interpreting the spatial and temporal neural activity generated in motor tasks. In this study, a nonlinear dynamical neural network is trained to predict the hand position of primates from neural recordings in a reaching task paradigm. We first develop a method to reveal the role attributed by the model to the sampled motor, premotor, and parietal cortices in generating band movements. Next, using the trained model weights, we derive a temporal sensitivity measure to asses how the model utilized the sampled cortices and neurons in real-time during BMI testing.

AB Objectives: This study aimed to identify demographic and housing features associated with functional difficulties experienced by older adults in their homes. Participants: Individuals aged & GE; 65 years who completed American Housing Survey (AHS) questionnaires. We selected one random person per household and excluded participants with missing data for the 12 AHS functional challenge items. Methods: Multiple machine learning models were compared to identify the best-performing model, which was then used to analyze the impact of demographic and housing features on older adults' functional difficulties at home. Results: The random forest model was selected for its preferred predictive performance (accuracy: 85.8%, sensitivity: 94.4%, specificity: 60.2%, precision: 87.6%, and negative predictive value: 78.2%). The top five variables that significantly influenced the model were: 1) walking disability, 2) presence or use of a cane or walker, 3) presence or use of handrails or grab bars in the bathroom, 4) go-outside-home disability, and 5) selfcare disability. These variables had a stronger impact on the model than the householder's health and age. Conclusion: Home modifications and environmental adaptations may be critical in enhancing functional abilities and independence among older adults. These findings could inform the development of interventions that promote safe and accessible living environments for older adults, thereby improving their quality of life.

AB A novel algorithm is developed to downscale soil moisture (SM), obtained at satellite scales of 10-40 km to 1 km by utilizing its temporal correlations to historical auxiliary data at finer scales. Including such correlations drastically minimizes the size of the training set needed, accounts for time-lagged relationships, and enables downscaling even in the presence of short gaps in the auxiliary data. The algorithm is based upon bagged regression trees (BRT) and uses correlations between high-resolution remote sensing products and SM observations. The algorithm trains multiple RTs and automatically chooses the trees that generate the best downscaled estimates. The algorithm was evaluated using a multiscale synthetic data set in north central Florida for two years, including two growing seasons of corn and one growing season of cotton per year. The timeaveraged error across the region was found to be 0.01 m(3)/m(3), with a standard deviation of 0.012 m(3)/m(3) when 0.02% of the data were used for training in addition to temporal correlations from the past seven days, and all available data from the past year. The maximum spatially averaged errors obtained using this algorithm in downscaled SM were 0.005 m(3)/m(3), for pixels with cotton land cover. When land surface temperature (LST) on the day of downscaling was not included in the algorithm to simulate "data gaps," the spatially averaged error increased minimally by 0.015 m(3)/m(3) when LST is unavailable on the day of downscaling. The results indicate that the BRT-based algorithm provides high accuracy for downscaling SM using complex nonlinear spatiotemporal correlations, under heterogeneous micrometeorological conditions.

AB Adsorptive hydrogen storage is a desirable technology for fuel cell vehicles, and efficiently identifying the optimal storage temperature requires modeling hydrogen loading as a continuous function of pressure and temperature. Using data obtained from high-throughput Monte Carlo simulations for zeolites, metal-organic frameworks, and hyper-cross-linked polymers, we develop a meta-learning model that jointly predicts the adsorption loading for multiple materials over wide ranges of pressure and temperature. Meta-learning gives higher accuracy and improved generalization compared to fitting a model separately to each material and allows us to identify the optimal hydrogen storage temperature with the highest working capacity for a given pressure difference. Materials with high optimal temperatures are found in close proximity in the fingerprint space and exhibit high isosteric heats of adsorption. Our method and results provide new guidelines toward the design of hydrogen storage materials and a new route to incorporate machine learning into high-throughput materials discovery.

AB Observational approaches may limit researchers' ability to comprehensively capture preschool classroom conversations, including the use of wh-words. In the current proof-of-concept study, we present descriptive results using an automated speech recognition (ASR) system coupled with location sensors to quantify teachers' wh-words by preschool teachers in the literacy activity areas of a preschool classroom. Data from two children, one is 5.3 years old with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and another is 5 years old without identified disabilities, along with teachers, were analyzed. We found that the ASR system is a viable solution for automatically quantifying the number of adult wh-words during interactions in preschool classrooms at different time points and locations. This paper reports how an ASR model, coupled with location sensors, quantifies the frequency of wh-words between two-time points and between a child with ADHD and a typically developing child. The results provide a proof of concept that an ASR model, including acoustic and language models, can automate the detection of wh-words in preschool teachers' classroom speech. However, further research with larger and more diverse samples is required to explore the cost and time implications of scaling up across a variety of settings and populations to inform efficient classwide and individualized data-driven instructional practices.

AB Knowledge of the pathogen-host interactions between the species is essentialin order to develop a solution strategy against infectious diseases. In vitro methods take extended periods of time to detect interactions and provide very few of the possible interaction pairs. Hence, modelling interactions between proteins has necessitated the development of computational methods. The main scope of this paper is integrating the known protein interactions between thehost and pathogen organisms to improve the prediction success rate of unknown pathogen-host interactions. Thus, the truepositive rate of the predictions was expected to increase.In order to perform this study extensively, encoding methods and learning algorithms of several proteins were tested. Along with human as the host organism, two different pathogen organisms were used in the experiments. For each combination of protein-encoding and prediction method, both the original prediction algorithms were tested using only pathogen-host interactions and the same methodwas testedagain after integrating the known protein interactions within each organism. The effect of merging the networks of pathogen-host interactions of different species on the prediction performance of state-of-the-art methods was also observed. Successwas measured in terms of Matthews correlation coefficient, precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy metrics. Empirical results showed that integrating the host and pathogen interactions yields better performance consistently in almost all experiments.

AB Recent connections in the adaptive control literature to continuous-time analogs of Nesterov's accelerated gradient method have led to the development of new real-time adaptation laws based on accelerated gradient methods. However, previous results assume that the system's uncertainties are linear-in-the-parameters (LIP). To compensate for non-LIP uncertainties, our preliminary results developed a neural network (NN)-based accelerated gradient adaptive controller to achieve trajectory tracking for nonlinear systems; however, the development and analysis only considered single-hidden-layer NNs. In this article, a generalized deep NN (DNN) architecture with an arbitrary number of hidden layers is considered, and a new DNN-based accelerated gradient adaptation scheme is developed to generate estimates of all the DNN weights in real-time. A nonsmooth Lyapunov-based analysis is used to guarantee the developed accelerated gradient-based DNN adaptation design achieves global asymptotic tracking error convergence for general nonlinear control affine systems subject to unknown (non-LIP) drift dynamics and exogenous disturbances. A comprehensive set of simulation studies are conducted on a two-state nonlinear system, a robotic manipulator, and a complex 20-D nonlinear system to demonstrate the improved performance of the developed method. Our simulation studies demonstrate enhanced tracking and function approximation performance from both DNN architectures and accelerated gradient adaptation.

AB Biological sequences do not come at random. Instead, they appear with particular frequencies that reflect properties of the associated system or phenomenon. Knowing how biological sequences are distributed in sequence space is thus a natural first step toward understanding the underlying mechanisms. Here we propose a method for inferring the probability distribution from which a sample of biological sequences were drawn for the case where the sequences are composed of elements that admit a natural ordering. Our method is based on Bayesian field theory, a physics-based machine learning approach, and can be regarded as a nonparametric extension of the traditional maximum entropy estimate. As an example, we use it to analyze the aneuploidy data pertaining to gliomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas project. In addition, we demonstrate two follow-up analyses that can be performed with the resulting probability distribution. One of them is to investigate the associations among the sequence sites. This provides a way to infer the governing biological grammar. The other is to study the global geometry of the probability landscape, which allows us to look at the problem from an evolutionary point of view. It can be seen that this methodology enables us to learn from a sample of sequences about how a biological system or phenomenon in the real world works.

AB Simple Summary Over 50% of all cancer patients receive radiation therapy (RT). The quality of the RT treatment plan is directly related to patient outcomes, such as overall survival and complications related to RT. In this study, we explore a knowledge-based machine learning tool for RT plan quality evaluation on plans submitted to a multicenter non-small-cell lung cancer clinical trial. The results of this study may provide critical information for the analysis of the end points of the trial. This study also demonstrated the feasibility of using this novel tool for RT plan quality assessment in the multicenter clinical trial setting. The outcome of the patient and the success of clinical trials involving RT is dependent on the quality assurance of the RT plans. Knowledge-based Planning (KBP) models using data from a library of high-quality plans have been utilized in radiotherapy to guide treatment. In this study, we report on the use of these machine learning tools to guide the quality assurance of multicenter clinical trial plans. The data from 130 patients submitted to RTOG1308 were included in this study. Fifty patient cases were used to train separate photon and proton models on a commercially available platform based on principal component analysis. Models evaluated 80 patient cases. Statistical comparisons were made between the KBP plans and the original plans submitted for quality evaluation. Both photon and proton KBP plans demonstrate a statistically significant improvement of quality in terms of organ-at-risk (OAR) sparing. Proton KBP plans, a relatively emerging technique, show more improvements compared with photon plans. The KBP proton model is a useful tool for creating proton plans that adhere to protocol requirements. The KBP tool was also shown to be a useful tool for evaluating the quality of RT plans in the multicenter clinical trial setting.

AB The paper reports on work concerned with the development of artificial neural network approaches to modeling the propagation of bomb blast waves in a built-up environment. A review of current methods of modeling blast wave propagation identifies a need for a modeling system that is both fast and versatile in its scope of application. This is followed by a description of a preliminary study that used artificial neural networks to estimate peak pressures on buildings protected by simple blast barriers, using data generated from, first, an existing empirical model and, second, miniature bomb-barrier-building experiments. The first of these studies demonstrates the viability of the approach in terms of producing accurate results very rapidly. However, the study using data from live miniature bomb-barrier-building experiments was inconclusive due to a poor distribution of the sample data. The paper then describes ongoing research refining this artificial neural network approach to allow the modeling of the time-wise progress of the blast wave over the surfaces of critical structures, facilitating a three-dimensional visualization of the problem. Finally, the paper outlines a proposed novel method of modeling blast wave propagation that uses a coarse-grain simulation approach combined with artificial neural networks, which has the goal of extending modeling to complicated geometries while maintaining rapid processing.

TI Identifying Cognitive States Using Regularity Partitions

ID CONNECTIVITY
AB Functional Magnetic Resonance (fMRI) data can be used to depict functional connectivity of the brain. Standard techniques have been developed to construct brain networks from this data; typically nodes are considered as voxels or sets of voxels with weighted edges between them representing measures of correlation. Identifying cognitive states based on fMRI data is connected with recording voxel activity over a certain time interval. Using this information, network and machine learning techniques can be applied to discriminate the cognitive states of the subjects by exploring different features of data. In this work we wish to describe and understand the organization of brain connectivity networks under cognitive tasks. In particular, we use a regularity partitioning algorithm that finds clusters of vertices such that they all behave with each other almost like random bipartite graphs. Based on the random approximation of the graph, we calculate a lower bound on the number of triangles as well as the expectation of the distribution of the edges in each subject and state. We investigate the results by comparing them to the state of the art algorithms for exploring connectivity and we argue that during epochs that the subject is exposed to stimulus, the inspected part of the brain is organized in an efficient way that enables enhanced functionality.

AB Human intention prediction plays a critical role in human-robot collaboration, as it helps robots improve efficiency and safety by accurately anticipating human intentions and proactively assisting with tasks. While current applications often focus on predicting intent once human action is completed, recognizing human intent in advance has received less attention. This study aims to equip robots with the capability to forecast human intent before completing an action, i.e., early intent prediction. To achieve this objective, we first extract features from human motion trajectories by analyzing changes in human joint distances. These features are then utilized in a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to determine the state transition times from uncertain intent to certain intent. Second, we propose two models including a Transformer and a Bi-LSTM for classifying motion intentions. Then, we design a human-robot collaboration experiment in which the operator reaches multiple targets while the robot moves continuously following a predetermined path. The data collected through the experiment were divided into two groups: full-length data and partial data before state transitions detected by the HMM. Finally, the effectiveness of the suggested framework for predicting intentions is assessed using two different datasets, particularly in a scenario when motion trajectories are similar but underlying intentions vary. The results indicate that using partial data prior to the motion completion yields better accuracy compared to using full-length data. Specifically, the transformer model exhibits a 2% improvement in accuracy, while the Bi-LSTM model demonstrates a 6% increase in accuracy.

AB Kinematic variables play an important role in collider phenomenology, as they expedite discoveries of new particles by separating signal events from unwanted background events and allow for measurements of particle properties such as masses, couplings, and spins. For the past ten years, an enormous number of kinematic variables have been designed and proposed, primarily for the experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider, allowing for a drastic reduction of highdimensional experimental data to lower-dimensional observables, from which one can readily extract underlying features of phase space and develop better-optimized data-analysis strategies. Recent developments in the area of phase-space kinematics are reviewd, and new kinematic variables with important phenomenological implications and physics applications are summarized. Recently proposed analysis methods and techniques specifically designed to leverage new kinematic variables are also reviewed. As machine learning is currently percolating through many fields of particle physics, including collider phenomenology, the interconnection and mutual complementarity of kinematic variables and machine-learning techniques are discussed. Finally, the manner in which utilization of kinematic variables originally developed for colliders can be extended to other high

AB In this paper a new method to improve the utilization of main memory systems is presented. The new method is based on prestoring in main memory a number of query answers, each evaluated out of a single memory page. To this end, the ideas of page-answers and page-traces are formally described and their properties analyzed. The query model used here allows for selection, projection, join, recursive queries as well as arbitrary combinations. We also show how to apply the approach under update traffic. This concept is especially useful in managing the main memories of an important class of applications. This class includes the evaluation of triggers and alerters, performance improvement of rule-based systems, integrity constraint checking, and materialized views. These applications are characterized by the existence at compile time of a predetermined set of queries, by a slow but persistent update traffic, and by their need to repetitively reevaluate the query set. The new approach represents a new type of intelligent database caching, which contrasts with traditional caching primarily in that the cache elements are derived data and as a consequence, they overlap arbitrarily and do not have a fixed length. The contents of the main memory cache are selected based on the data distribution within the database, the set of fixed queries to preprocess, and the paging characteristics. Page-answers and page-traces are used as the smallest indivisible units in the cache. An efficient heuristic. to select a near optimal set of page-answers and page-traces to populate the main memory has been developed, implemented, and tested. Finally, quantitative measurements of performance benefits are reported.

ID HEALTH INFORMATION
AB Introduction Artificial Intelligence (AI) platforms have gained widespread attention for their distinct ability to generate automated responses to various prompts. However, its role in assessing the quality and readability of a provided text remains unclear. Thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the proficiency of the conversational generative pre-trained transformer (ChatGPT) in utilizing the DISCERN tool to evaluate the quality of online content regarding shock wave therapy for erectile dysfunction. Methods Websites were generated using a Google search of "shock wave therapy for erectile dysfunction" with location filters disabled. Readability was analyzed using Readable software (Readable.com, Horsham, United Kingdom). Quality was assessed independently by three reviewers using the DISCERN tool. The same plain text files collected were inputted into ChatGPT to determine whether they produced comparable metrics for readability and quality. Results The study results revealed a notable disparity between ChatGPT's readability assessment and that obtained from a reliable tool, Readable.com (p<0.05). This indicates a lack of alignment between ChatGPT's algorithm and that of established tools, such as Readable.com. Similarly, the DISCERN score generated by ChatGPT differed significantly from the scores generated manually by human evaluators (p<0.05), suggesting that ChatGPT may not be capable of accurately identifying poor-quality information sources regarding shock wave therapy as a treatment for erectile dysfunction. Conclusion ChatGPT's evaluation of the quality and readability of online text regarding shockwave therapy for erectile dysfunction differs from that of human raters and trusted tools. Therefore, ChatGPT's current capabilities were not sufficient for reliably assessing the quality and readability of textual content. Further research is needed to elucidate the role of AI in the objective evaluation of online medical content in other fields. Continued development in AI and incorporation of tools such as DISCERN into AI software may enhance the way patients navigate the web in search of high-quality medical content in the future.

AB Influenza viruses pose great threats to public health and cause enormous economic losses every year. Previous work has revealed the viral factors associated with the virulence of influenza viruses in mammals. However, taking prior viral knowledge represented by heterogeneous categorical and discrete information into account to explore virus virulence is scarce in the existing work. How to make full use of the preceding domain knowledge in virulence study is challenging but beneficial. This paper proposes a general framework named ViPal for virulence prediction in mice that incorporates discrete prior viral mutation and reassortment information based on all eight influenza segments. The posterior regularization technique is leveraged to transform prior viral knowledge into constraint features and integrated into the machine learning models. Experimental results on influenza genomic datasets validate that our proposed framework can improve virulence prediction performance over baselines. The comparison between ViPal and other existing methods shows the computational efficiency of our framework with comparable or superior performance. Moreover, the interpretable analysis through SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) identifies the scores of constraint features contributing to the prediction. We hope this framework could provide assistance for the accurate detection of influenza virulence and facilitate flu surveillance.

AB The shortcoming of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and its variations have been highlighted in literature for quite some time. A critical limitation of these models is ignoring the social aspect, how situational and motivational involvement impact customers' adoption of these technologies. After the initial phase of novelty, an individual's Involvement with technology plays a crucial role in shaping their behavior regarding a technology. A more thorough comprehension of customers' experiences and the memorable and captivating moments they encounter is necessary to develop a comprehensive understanding of the adoption of service robots. Using motivation theory and the theory of conspicuous approach, we propose and test a novel model to examine the role of extrinsic and intrinsic motivation and social status on customers' attitudes and intention to use service robots during the pandemic. Using a sample of 525 U.S. hotel guests, we showed that motivation and social status positively influence customer attitude and, consequently, their intention to use service robots in hotels. Customer attitude fully mediates the relationship between variables in the model. Additionally, a multi-group analysis of involvement (low and high) indicated that guests' attitudes had a more substantial effect on their intention to use service robots for the high involvement group. Finally, with a linear regression model, we showed that the feelings of safety and comfort influence the customers' intention to use service robots during the pandemic. This study expands knowledge on technology adoption, motivation, and conspicuous consumption theories. It also provides valuable insight to hotel managers in better understanding what influences customer adoption of new technologies.

AB Although degradation modeling has been widely applied to use multiple sensor signals to monitor the degradation process and predict the remaining useful lifetime (RUL) of operating machinery units, three challenging issues remain. One challenge is that units in engineering cases usually work under multiple operational conditions, causing the distribution of sensor signals to vary over conditions. It remains unexplored to characterize time-varying conditions as a distribution shift problem. The second challenge is that sensor signal fusion and degradation status modeling are separated into two independent steps in most of the existing methods, which ignores the intrinsic correlation between the two parts. The last challenge is how to find an accurate health index (HI) of units using previous knowledge of degradation. To tackle these issues, this article proposes an adaptation-aware interactive learning (AAIL) approach for degradation modeling. First, a condition-invariant HI is developed to handle time-varying operation conditions. Second, an interactive framework based on the fusion and degradation model is constructed, which naturally integrates a supervised learner and an unsupervised learner. To estimate the model parameters of AAIL, we propose an interactive training algorithm that shares learned degradation and fusion information during the model training process. A case study that uses the degradation data set of aircraft engines demonstrates that the proposed AAIL outperforms related benchmark methods.

AB Community and household vulnerability to natural hazards, e.g., earthquakes, hurricanes, and floods, is a concern that transcends geographic and economic boundaries. Despite the abundance of research in this field, most existing methods remain inefficient and face the challenge of data scarcity. By formulating and investigating the correlation between the household vulnerability and street view images of buildings, this research seeks to bridge the knowledge gap to enable an efficient assessment. Especially in developing countries, the widespread prevalence of outdated or inadequately enforced building codes poses a significant challenge. Consequently, a considerable portion of the housing stock in these regions fails to meet acceptable standards, rendering it highly vulnerable to natural hazards and climate-related events. Evaluating housing quality is crucial for informing public policies and private investments. However, current assessment methods are often time-consuming and costly. To address this issue, we propose the development of a rapid and reliable evaluation framework that is also cost-efficient. The framework employs a low-cost street view imagery procedure combined with deep learning to automatically extract building information to assist in identifying housing characteristics. We then test its potential for scalability and higher-level reliability. More importantly, we aim to quantify household vulnerability based on street view imagery. Household vulnerability is typically assessed through traditional means like surveys or census data; however, these sources can be costly and may not reflect the most current information. We have developed an index that effectively captures the most detailed data available at both the housing unit and household level. This index serves as a comprehensive representation, enabling us to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing our model's predictions to estimate vulnerability conditions in specific areas while optimizing costs. Through latent class clustering and ANOVA analysis, we have discovered a strong correlation between the predictions derived from the images and the household vulnerability index. This correlation will potentially enable large-scale, cost-effective evaluation of household vulnerability using only street view images.

Methods We propose a new method, Spatial and Texture Analysis of Root SystEm distribution with Earth mover's Distance (STARSEED), for comparing root system distributions that incorporates spatial information through a novel application of the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD). Results We illustrate that the approach captures the response of sesame root systems for different genotypes and soil moisture levels. STARSEED provides quantitative and visual insights into changes that occur in root architectures across experimental treatments.

AB Predicting crop yields and their spatio-temporal variability under a changing climate is a challenging but essential undertaking for crop management and policymaking purposes. The availability of information on risks associated with effects of climatic variability on agricultural activity outcomes is critical for stakeholders ranging from individual landowners to national economists alike. This research was conducted as a pilot study to (1) develop satellite remote sensing based estimates of maize acreage in a typical Maize growing region in Pakistan, (2) to develop a statistical-empirical model for prediction of maize yields, and finally, (3) to assess the influence of temperature on inter-annual variability in maize yields across a decade. A total of eight machine learning algorithms were tested for identifying maize growing operations in the Faisalabad district of Pakistan using Landsat 8 imagery. Classification models were evaluated via 200 randomly selected ground-verified points across the study region. Results of the maize mapping exercise were used to estimate interannual maize yields using Landsat-derived multi-temporal normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) data as predictors. Predictors for the yield forecasting model were selected via principal component screening and were fed into a least absolute shrinkage and selection (LASSO) regression model. The yield model thus developed was applied to 10 years of past data (2006-2017) and validated against data recorded by government sources. Finally, predictions spanning the ten years were tested for effects of temperature variability to find evidence of influence of ambient temperature on maize yields. Results indicate that support vector machine classifiers work the best in this landscape (accuracies 90%) and reveal that maize cropping area may be underestimated in government sources by as much as 14%. The LASSO regression models also showed very good fits (validation R-2 = 0.95) and were fairly accurate in tracking interannual variations in maize yields (R-2 = 0.78.) Results also indicate that the maximum temperature has significant negative influence (R-2 = 0.76, P < 0.0001) on maize yields in Faisalabad district. Methods presented in this study should be of use to policymakers for better formulating export-import policies and decisions governing food security issues in the larger region.

AB The composition of microbial communities has been known to be location-specific. Investigating the microbial composition across different cities enables us to unravel city-specific microbial signatures and further predict the origin of unknown samples. As part of the CAMDA 2020 Metagenomic Geolocation Challenge, MetaSUB provided the whole genome shotgun (WGS) metagenomics data from samples across 28 cities along with non-microbial city data for 23 of these cities. In our solution to this challenge, we implemented feature selection, normalization, clustering and three methods of machine learning to classify the cities based on their microbial compositions. Of the three methods, multilayer perceptron obtained the best performance with an error rate of 19.60% based on whether the correct city received the highest or second highest number of votes for the test data contained in the main dataset. We then trained the model to predict the origins of samples from the mystery dataset by including these samples with the additional group label of "mystery." The mystery dataset compromised of samples collected from a subset of the cities in the main dataset as well as samples collected from new cities. For samples from cities that belonged to the main dataset, error rates ranged from 18.18 to 72.7%. For samples from new cities that did not belong to the main dataset, 57.7% of the test samples could be correctly labeled as "mystery" samples. Furthermore, we also predicted some of the non-microbial features for the mystery samples from the cities that did not belong to main dataset to draw inferences and narrow the range of the possible sample origins using a multi-output multilayer perceptron algorithm.

AB For the task-scheduling problem, we propose an augmented neural-network approach, which allows the integration of greedy as well as nongreedy heuristics (AugNN-GNG), to give improved solutions in a small number of iterations. The problem we address is that of minimizing the makespan of n tasks on m identical machines (or processors), where tasks are nonpreemptive and follow a precedence order. The proposed approach exploits the observation that a nongreedy search heuristic often finds better solutions than do their greedy counterparts. We hypothesize that combinations of nongreedy and greedy heuristics when integrated with an augmented neural-network approach can lead to better solutions than can either one alone. We show the formulation of such integration and provide empirical results on over a thousand problems. This approach is found to be very robust in that the results were not very sensitive to the type of greedy heuristic chosen. The new approach is able to find solutions, on average, within 1.8% to 2.8% of the lower bound compared to 2.0% to 8.3% for the greedy-only AugNN approach. This improvement is obtained without any increase in computational complexity. In fact the number of iterations used to find the solution decreased.

ID SEMIPARAMETRIC ANALYSIS
AB While many survival models have been invented, the Cox model and the proportional odds model are among the most popular ones. Both models are special cases of the linear transformation model. The linear transformation model typically assumes a linear function on covariates, which may not reflect the complex relationship between covariates and survival outcomes. Nonlinear functional form can also be specified in the linear transformation model. Nonetheless, the underlying functional form is unknown and mis-specifying it leads to biased estimates and reduced prediction accuracy of the model. To address this issue, we develop a neural-network transformation model. Similar to neural networks, the neural-network transformation model uses its hierarchical structure to learn complex features from simpler ones and is capable of approximating the underlying functional form of covariates. It also inherits advantages from the linear transformation model, making it applicable to both time-to-event analyses and recurrent event analyses. Simulations demonstrate that the neural-network transformation model outperforms the linear transformation model in terms of estimation and prediction accuracy when the covariate effects are nonlinear. The advantage of the new model over the linear transformation model is also illustrated via two real applications.

ID QUERY
AB Topological relationships between spatial objects such as overlap, disjoint, and inside have for a long time been a focus of research in a number of disciplines like cognitive science, robotics, linguistics, artificial intelligence, and spatial reasoning. In particular as predicates, they support the design of suitable query languages for spatial data retrieval and analysis in spatial database systems and Geographic Information Systems. While conceptual aspects of topological predicates (like their definition and reasoning with them) as well as strategies for avoiding unnecessary or repetitive predicate evaluations (like predicate migration and spatial index structures) have been emphasized, the development of correct and efficient implementation techniques for them has been rather neglected. Recently, the design of topological predicates for different combinations of complex spatial data types has led to a large increase of their numbers and accentuated the need for their efficient implementation. The goal of this article is to develop efficient implementation techniques of topological predicates for all combinations of the complex spatial data types point2D, line2D, and region2D, as they have been specified by different authors and in different commercial and public domain software packages. Our solution is a two-phase approach. In the exploration phase, for a given scene of two spatial objects, all topological events like intersection and meeting situations are recorded in two precisely defined topological feature vectors (one for each argument object of a topological predicate) whose specifications are characteristic and unique for each combination of spatial data types. These vectors serve as input for the evaluation phase which analyzes the topological events and determines the Boolean result of a topological predicate or the kind of topological predicate. This paper puts an emphasis on the exploration phase and the definition of the topological feature vectors. In addition, it presents a straightforward evaluation method.

AB Background: Racial disparities in COVID-19 incidence and outcomes have been widely reported. Non-Hispanic Black patientsendured worse outcomes disproportionately compared with non-Hispanic White patients, but the epidemiological basis for theseobservations was complex and multifaceted.Objective: This study aimed to elucidate the potential reasons behind the worse outcomes of COVID-19 experienced bynon-Hispanic Black patients compared with non-Hispanic White patients and how these variables interact using an explainablemachine learning approach.Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we examined 28,943 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases from the OneFloridaResearch Consortium's data trust of health care recipients in Florida through April 28, 2021. We assessed the prevalence ofpre-existing comorbid conditions, geo-socioeconomic factors, and health outcomes in the structured electronic health records ofCOVID-19 cases. The primary outcome was a composite of hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and mortality at indexadmission. We developed and validated a machine learning model using Extreme Gradient Boosting to evaluate predictors ofworse outcomes of COVID-19 and rank them by importance.Results: Compared to non-Hispanic White patients, non-Hispanic Blacks patients were younger, more likely to be uninsured,had a higher prevalence of emergency department and inpatient visits, and were in regions with higher area deprivation indexrankings and pollutant concentrations. Non-Hispanic Black patients had the highest burden of comorbidities and rates of theprimary outcome. Age was a key predictor in all models, ranking highest in non-Hispanic White patients. However, for non-HispanicBlack patients, congestive heart failure was a primary predictor. Other variables, such as food environment measures and airpollution indicators, also ranked high. By consolidating comorbidities into the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index, this became thetop predictor, providing a comprehensive risk measure. Conclusions: The study reveals that individual and geo-socioeconomic factors significantly influence the outcomes of COVID-19.It also highlights varying risk profiles among different racial groups. While these findings suggest potential disparities, furthercausal inference and statistical testing are needed to fully substantiate these observations. Recognizing these relationships is vitalfor creating effective, tailored interventions that reduce disparities and enhance health outcomes across all racial and socioeconomicgroups

AB Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied in artificial intelligent systems to perform sensory processing, sequence learning, and image processing. In contrast to conventional computing-centric applications, CNNs are known to be both computationally and memory intensive. The computational and memory resources of CNN applications are mixed together in the network weights. This incurs a significant amount of data movement, especially for high-dimensional convolutions. The emerging Processing-in-Memory (PIM) alleviates this memory bottleneck by integrating both processing elements and memory into a 3D-stacked architecture. Although this architecture can offer fast near-data processing to reduce data movement, memory is still a limiting factor of the entire system. We observe that an unsolved key challenge is how to efficiently allocate convolutions to 3D-stacked PIM to combine the advantages of both neural and computational processing. This paper presents MemoNet, a memory-efficient data allocation strategy for convolutional neural networks on 3D PIM architecture. MemoNet offers fine-grained parallelism that can fully exploit the computational power of PIM architecture. The objective is to capture the characteristics of neural network applications and perfectly match the underlining hardware resources provided by PIM, resulting in a hardware-independent design to transparently allocate data. We formulate the target problem as a dynamic programming model and present an optimal solution. To demonstrate the viability of the proposed MemoNet, we conduct a set of experiments using a variety of realistic convolutional neural network applications. The extensive evaluations show that, MemoNet can significantly improve the performance and the cache utilization compared to representative schemes.

ID SEGMENTATION
AB Neural networks (NNs) that are trained to perform classification may not perform as well when used as a module in a larger system. In this correspondence, we introduce a novel, system-level method for training NNs with application to counting white blood cells. The idea is to phrase the objective function in terms of total count error rather than the traditional class-coding approach because the goal of this particular recognition system is to accurately count white blood cells of each class, not to classify them. An objective function that represents the sum of the squared counting errors (SSCE) is defined. A batch-mode training scheme based on back-propagation and gradient descent is derived. Sigma and crisp counts are used to evaluate the counting performance. The testing results show that the network trained to minimize SSCE performs better in counting than a classification network with the same structure even though both are trained a comparable number of iterations. This result is consistent with the principle of least commitment of Marr.

ID DECOMPOSITION
AB Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is the task of recognizing a speaker's emotional state from speech. SER plays a significant role in Human-Computer Interaction and psychological assessment. Several kinds of time-frequency representations like spectrograms, mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCCs), and mel-spectrograms are commonly used to develop an SER system. These representations use the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to convert the time domain signal to the frequency domain. However, the FFT has one fundamental limitation due to the uncertainty principle, which does not simultaneously allow a good resolution in both time and frequency domains. On the other hand, the multiresolution property of wavelets can provide a good localization in both time and frequency domains. Therefore, this article investigates the competency of the wavelet transforms for SER. We propose a Wavelet based Deep Emotion Recognition (WaDER) method using an autoencoder and 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The autoencoder is used to perform the dimensionality reduction of the wavelet features then the latent space is used to classify the emotions using the 1D CNN-LSTM model. We conducted a Monte-Carlo K-fold validation using the Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS) dataset. For speaker-dependent (SD) experiments, we achieved an unweighted accuracy (UA) of 81.45% and a weighted accuracy (WA) of 81.22%. The results of the experiments on the RAVDESS dataset show that the proposed method performs better than the state-of-the-art methods, which use other time-frequency representations.

AB Conceptualizing and understanding global, physical systems like Earth's ocean is challenging. Data visualizations on touch-based technology allow learners to explore systems and facilitate embodied experiences, promoting deeper understanding. We investigated how direct manipulation of data visualizations on a touchscreen table affords meaningful learning of science concepts and practices. Using a conceptual framework informed by embodied cognition and sociocultural theory, we analyzed the use of an application displaying global ocean temperature visualizations. Eleven adult-child groups of two to four participants used a think-aloud procedure during four tasks in a lab setting. We recorded, transcribed, and qualitatively coded resulting utterances, looking for evidence of concepts and practices, group meaning-making, and language that could point to embodied cognition. Participants discussed science content and engaged in scientific practices such as describing patterns and refining ideas. Participants used ontological, orientational, and metonymic conceptual metaphors. We discuss implications and provide suggestions for data visualizations on touch platforms.

TI Integrating multi-platform genomic datasets for kidney renal clear cell

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

DT Article
ID HETEROGENEITY; TISSUES; MTOR
AB Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is highly heterogeneous and is the most lethal cancer of all urologic cancers. We developed an unsupervised deep learning method, stacked denoising autoencoders (SdA), by integrating multi-platform genomic data for subtyping ccRCC with the goal of assisting diagnosis, personalized treatments and prognosis. We successfully found two subtypes of ccRCC using five genomics datasets for Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Correlation analysis between the last reconstructed input and the original input data showed that all the five types of genomic data positively contribute to the identification of the subtypes. The first subtype of patients had significantly lower survival probability, higher grade on neoplasm histology and higher stage on pathology than the other subtype of patients. Furthermore, we identified a set of genes, proteins and miRNAs that were differential expressed (DE) between the two subtypes. The function annotation of the DE genes from pathway analysis matches the clinical features. Importantly, we applied the model learned from KIRC as a pre-trained model to two independent datasets from TCGA, Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) dataset and Low Grade Glioma (LGG), and the model stratified the LUAD and LGG patients into clinical associated subtypes. The successful application of our method to independent groups of patients supports that the SdA method and the model learned from KIRC are effective on subtyping cancer patients and most likely can be used on other similar tasks.

AB Reuse of alternative water sources for irrigation (e.g., untreated surface water) is a sustainable approach that has the potential to reduce water gaps, while increasing food production. However, when growing fresh produce, this practice increases the risk of bacterial contamination. Thus, rapid and accurate identification of pathogenic organisms such as Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC) is crucial for resource management when using alternative water(s). Although many biosensors exist for monitoring pathogens in food systems, there is an urgent need for data analysis methodologies that can be applied to accurately predict bacteria concentrations in complex matrices such as untreated surface water. In this work, we applied an impedimetric electrochemical aptasensor based on gold interdigitated electrodes for measuring E. coli O157:H7 in surface water for hydroponic lettuce irrigation. We developed a statistical machine-learning (SML) framework for assessing different existing SML methods to predict the E. coli O157:H7 concentration. In this study, three classes of statistical models were evaluated for optimizing prediction accuracy. The SML framework developed here facilitates selection of the most appropriate analytical approach for a given application. In the case of E. coli O157:H7 prediction in untreated surface water, selection of the optimum SML technique led to a reduction of test set RMSE by at least 20% when compared with the classic analytical technique. The statistical framework and code (open source) include a portfolio of SML models, an approach which can be used by other researchers using electrochemical biosensors to measure pathogens in hydroponic irrigation water for rapid decision support.

AB Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the global need for vaccines to prevent the disease is imperative. To date, several manufacturers have made efforts to develop vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. In spite of the success of developing many useful vaccines so far, it will be helpful for future vaccine designs, targetting long-term disease protection. For this, we need to know more details of the mechanism of T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we first detected pairwise differentially expressed genes among the healthy, mild, and severe COVID-19 groups of patients based on the expression of CD4(+) T cells and CD8(+) T cells, respectively. The CD4(+) T cells dataset contains 6 mild COVID-19 patients, 8 severe COVID-19 patients, and 6 healthy donors, while the CD8(+) T cells dataset has 15 mild COVID-19 patients, 22 severe COVID-19 patients, and 4 healthy donors. Furthermore, we utilized the deep learning algorithm to investigate the potential of differentially expressed genes in distinguishing different disease states. Finally, we built co-expression networks among those genes separately. For CD4(+) T cells, we identified 6 modules for the healthy network, 4 modules for the mild network, and 1 module for the severe network; for CD8(+) T cells, we detected 6 modules for the healthy network, 4 modules for the mild network, and 3 modules for the severe network. We also obtained hub genes for each module and evaluated the differential connectivity of each gene between pairs of networks constructed on different disease states. Summarizing the results, we find that the following genes TNF, CCL4, XCL1, and IFITM1 can be highly identified with SARS-CoV-2. It is interesting to see that IFITM1 has already been known to inhibit multiple infections with other enveloped viruses, including coronavirus. In addition, our networks show some specific patterns of connectivity among genes and some meaningful clusters related to COVID-19. The results might improve the insight of gene expression mechanisms associated with both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, expand our understanding of COVID-19 and help develop vaccines with long-term protection.

AB The Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) Think Tank XI was held on August 9-11, 2023 in Gainesville, Florida with the theme of "Pushing the Forefront of Neuromodulation". The keynote speaker was Dr. Nico Dosenbach from Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. He presented his research recently published in Nature inn a collaboration with Dr. Evan Gordon to identify and characterize the somato-cognitive action network (SCAN), which has redefined the motor homunculus and has led to new hypotheses about the integrative networks underpinning therapeutic DBS. The DBS Think Tank was founded in 2012 and provides an open platform where clinicians, engineers, and researchers (from industry and academia) can freely discuss current and emerging DBS technologies, as well as logistical and ethical issues facing the field. The group estimated that globally more than 263,000 DBS devices have been implanted for neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. This year's meeting was focused on advances in the following areas: cutting-edge translational neuromodulation, cutting-edge physiology, advances in neuromodulation from Europe and Asia, neuroethical dilemmas, artificial intelligence and computational modeling, time scales in DBS for mood disorders, and advances in future neuromodulation devices.

AB In dealing with massive flow cytometric data, a real-time adaptive clustering technique referred to as RTAC has been developed. This technique adopts the brain metaphor for information processing. The problem-solving structure is configured as a connectionist network. Information is encoded in the form of connection weights. The structure evolves as more data are seen by adjusting its weights, governed by a learning equation. The number of clusters need not be predefined. The algorithm is fast and robust. The results are reported from the domain of measuring the antigenic properties of blood samples. Its relations to other clustering alternatives are discussed. The technique has been validated statistically with respect to self-consistency.

TI A Tensor-Product-Kernel Framework for Multiscale Neural Activity

ID BRAIN-MACHINE INTERFACE; CORTICAL CONTROL; NETWORK; ARM
AB Brain machine interfaces (BMIs) have attracted intense attention as a promising technology for directly interfacing computers or prostheses with the brain's motor and sensory areas, thereby bypassing the body. The availability of multiscale neural recordings including spike trains and local field potentials (LFPs) brings potential opportunities to enhance computational modeling by enriching the characterization of the neural system state. However, heterogeneity on data type (spike timing versus continuous amplitude signals) and spatiotemporal scale complicates the model integration of multiscale neural activity. In this paper, we propose a tensor-product-kernel-based framework to integrate the multiscale activity and exploit the complementary information available in multiscale neural activity. This provides a common mathematical framework for incorporating signals from different domains. The approach is applied to the problem of neural decoding and control. For neural decoding, the framework is able to identify the nonlinear functional relationship between the multiscale neural responses and the stimuli using general purpose kernel adaptive filtering. In a sensory stimulation experiment, the tensor-product-kernel decoder outperforms decoders that use only a single neural data type. In addition, an adaptive inverse controller for delivering electrical microstimulation patterns that utilizes the tensor-product kernel achieves promising results in emulating the responses to natural stimulation.

AB Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) admit unconfounded design-based inference - randomization largely justifies the assumptions underlying statistical effect estimates - but often have limited sample sizes. However, researchers may have access to big observational data on covariates and outcomes from RCT nonparticipants. For example, data from A/B tests conducted within an educational technology platform exist alongside historical observational data drawn from student logs. We outline a design-based approach to using such observational data for variance reduction in RCTs. First, we use the observational data to train a machine learning algorithm predicting potential outcomes using covariates and then use that algorithm to generate predictions for RCT participants. Then, we use those predictions, perhaps alongside other covariates, to adjust causal effect estimates with a flexible, design-based covariate-adjustment routine. In this way, there is no danger of biases from the observational data leaking into the experimental estimates, which are guaranteed to be exactly unbiased regardless of whether the machine learning models are "correct" in any sense or whether the observational samples closely resemble RCT samples. We demonstrate the method in analyzing 33 randomized A/B tests and show that it decreases standard errors relative to other estimators, sometimes substantially.

AB Analysis of respiratory electromyographic (EMG) signals in the study of respiratory control requires the detection of burst activity from background(signal segmentation), and focuses upon the determination of onset and cessation points of the burst activity (boundary estimation). This paper describes a new automated multiresolution technique for signal segmentation and boundary estimation; During signal segmentation; a new transitional segment is defined which contains the boundary between background and burst activity. Boundary, estimation is then performed within this transitional segment. Boundary candidates are selected and a probability is attributed to each candidate, using an artificial neural network. The final boundary for a given transitional segment is the boundary estimate with the maximum a posteriori probability. This new method has proved accurate when compared to boundaries chosen by two investigatiors.

ID ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY; ETHYLENE
AB Electrically conductive metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of materials with emergent applications in fields such as electrocatalysis, electrochemical energy storage, and chemiresistive sensors due to their unique combination of porosity and conductivity. However, due to the structural complexity and versatility, rational design of conductive MOFs is still challenging, which limits their further development and applications. To overcome this limitation, we established a database of 224 conductive MOFs, covering all of the reported conductive MOFs as far as we know, and utilized a combination of machine learning (ML) models and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to develop structure-conductivity relationship models. The interpretability of the models provided guidelines for the design of these materials and allowed us to identify new conductive MOFs through rapid screening. Subsequent experiments confirmed the model's reliability and viability by synthesizing and validating a conductive MOF, CuTTPD, selected via the ML screening. Our results demonstrate that ML models are powerful tools for prescreening new conductive MOFs, thereby accelerating the development of this field.

AB As we learn to perform a motor task with novel dynamics, the central nervous system must adapt motor commands and modify sensorimotor transformations. The objective of the current research is to identify the neural mechanisms underlying the adaptive process. It has been shown previously that an increase in muscle co-contraction is frequently associated with the initial phase of adaptation and that co-contraction is gradually reduced as performance improves. Our investigation focused on the neural substrates of muscle co-contraction during the course of motor adaptation using a resting-state fMRI approach in healthy human subjects of both genders. We analyzed the functional connectivity in resting-state networks during three phases of adaptation, corresponding to different muscle co-contraction levels and found that change in the strength of functional connectivity in one brain network was correlated with a metric of co-contraction, and in another with a metric of motor learning. We identified the cerebellum as the key component for regulating muscle co-contraction, especially its connection to the inferior parietal lobule, which was particularly prominent in early stage adaptation. A neural link between cerebellum, superior frontal gyrus and motor cortical regions was associated with reduction of co-contraction during later stages of adaptation. We also found reliable changes in the functional connectivity of a network involving primary motor cortex, superior parietal lobule and cerebellum that were specifically related to the motor learning.
   Significance Statement
   It is well known that co-contracting muscles is an effective strategy for providing postural stability by modulating mechanical impedance and thereby allowing the central nervous system to compensate for unfamiliar or unexpected physical conditions until motor commands can be appropriately adapted. The present study elucidates the neural substrates underlying the ability to modulate the mechanical impedance of a limb as we learn during motor adaptation. Using resting-state fMRI analysis we demonstrate that a distributed cerebellar-parietal-frontal network functions to regulate muscle co-contraction with the cerebellum as its key component.

AB The paper presents a method for time series prediction using local dynamic modeling. After embedding the input data in a reconstruction space using a memory structure, a self-organizing map (SOM) derives a set of local models from these data. Afterwards, a set of single layer neural networks, trained optimally with a system of linear equations, is applied at the SOM's output. The goal of the last network is to, fit a local model from the winning neuron and a set of neighbours of the SOM map. Finally, the performance of the proposed method was validated using two chaotic time series.

TI Response surface and neural network techniques for rocket engine
   injector optimization
SO JOURNAL OF PROPULSION AND POWER
LA English
DT Article
AB The response surface methodology for rocket engine injector design optimization for which only modest amounts of data may exist is examined. Two main aspects are emphasized: relative performance of quadratic and cubic polynomial response surfaces and enhancement of the fidelity of the response surface via neural networks. A data set of 45 design points from a semi-empirical model for a shear coaxial injector element using gaseous oxygen and gaseous hydrogen propellants is used to formulate response surfaces using quadratic and cubic polynomials. This original data set is also employed to train a two-layered radial basis neural network (RBNN). The trained network is then used to generate additional data to augment the original information available to characterize the design space. Quadratic and cubic polynomials are again used to generate response surfaces for this RBNN-enhanced data set, The response surfaces resulting from both the original and RBNN-enhanced data sets are compared for accuracy. Whereas the cubic fit is superior to the quadratic fit for each data set, the RBNN-enhanced data set is capable of improving the accuracy of the response surface if noticeable errors from polynomial curve fits are encountered. Furthermore, the RBNN-enhanced data set yields more consistent selections of optimal designs between cubic and quadratic polynomials. The techniques de, eloped can be directly applied to injector design and optimization for rocket propulsion.

AB The performance of genomic prediction (GP) on genetically correlated traits can be improved through an interdependence multi-trait model under a multi-environment context. In this study, a panel of 237 soft facultative wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) lines was evaluated to compare single- and multi-trait models for predicting grain yield (GY), harvest index (HI), spike fertility (SF), and thousand grain weight (TGW). The panel was phenotyped in two locations and two years in Florida under drought and moderately drought stress conditions, while the genotyping was performed using 27,957 genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) makers. Five predictive models including Multi-environment Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Predictor (MGBLUP), Bayesian Multi-trait Multi-environment (BMTME), Bayesian Multi-output Regressor Stacking (BMORS), Single-trait Multi-environment Deep Learning (SMDL), and Multi-trait Multi-environment Deep Learning (MMDL) were compared. Across environments, the multi-trait statistical model (BMTME) was superior to the multi-trait DL model for prediction accuracy in most scenarios, but the DL models were comparable to the statistical models for response to selection. The multi-trait model also showed 5 to 22% more genetic gain compared to the single-trait model across environment reflected by the response to selection. Overall, these results suggest that multi-trait genomic prediction can be an efficient strategy for economically important yield component related traits in soft wheat.

AB Sensor technologies for mastitis detection have resulted in the collection and availability of a large amount of data. As a result, scientific publications reporting mastitis detection research have become less driven by approaches based on biological assumptions and more by data-driven modeling. Most of these ap-proaches try to predict mastitis events from (combina-tions of) raw sensor data to which a wide variety of methods are applied originating from machine learning and classical statistical approaches. However, an even wider variety in terminologies is used by researchers for methods that are similar in nature. This makes it dif-ficult for readers from other disciplines to understand the specific methods that are used and how these differ from each other. The aim of this paper was to provide a framework (filtering, transformation, and classifica-tion) for describing the different methods applied in sensor data-based clinical mastitis detection research and use this framework to review and categorize the approaches and underlying methods described in the scientific literature on mastitis detection. We identified 40 scientific publications between 1992 and 2020 that applied methods to detect clinical mastitis from sensor data. Based on these publications, we developed and used the framework and categorized these scientific publications into the 2 data processing techniques of filtering and transformation. These data processing techniques make raw data more amendable to be used for the third step in our framework, that of classifi-cation, which is used to distinguish between healthy and nonhealthy (mastitis) cows. Most publications (n = 34) used filtering or transformation, or a combina-tion of these 2, for data processing before classification, whereas the remaining publications (n = 6) classified the observations directly from raw data. Concerning classification, applying a simple threshold was the most used method (n = 19 publications). Our work identified that within approaches several different methods and terminologies for similar methods were used. Not all publications provided a clear description of the method used, and therefore it seemed that different methods were used between publications, whereas in fact just a different terminology was used, or the other way around. This paper is intended to serve as a reference for people from various research disciplines who need to collaborate and communicate efficiently about the topic of sensor-based mastitis detection and the methods used in this context. The framework used in this paper can support future research to correctly classify approaches and methods, which can improve the understanding of scientific publication. We encourage future research on sensor-based animal disease detection, including that of mastitis detection, to use a more coherent terminology for methods, and clearly state which technique (e.g., filtering) and approach (e.g., moving average) are used. This paper, therefore, can serve as a starting point and further stimulates the interdisciplinary cooperation in sensor-based mastitis research.

AB Based on a critical analysis of data analytics and its foundations, we propose a functional approach to estimate data ensemble properties, which is based entirely on the empirical observations of discrete data samples and the relative proximity of these points in the data space and hence named empirical data analysis (EDA). The ensemble functions include the nonparametric square centrality (a measure of closeness used in graph theory) and typicality (an empirically derived quantity which resembles probability). A distinctive feature of the proposed new functional approach to data analysis is that it does not assume randomness or determinism of the empirically observed data, nor independence. The typicality is derived from the discrete data directly in contrast to the traditional approach, where a continuous probability density function is assumed a priori. The typicality is expressed in a closed analytical form that can be calculated recursively and, thus, is computationally very efficient. The proposed nonparametric estimators of the ensemble properties of the data can also be interpreted as a discrete form of the information potential (known from the information theoretic learning theory as well as the Parzen windows). Therefore, EDA is very suitable for the current move to a data-rich environment, where the understanding of the underlying phenomena behind the available vast amounts of data is often not clear. We also present an extension of EDA for inference. The areas of applications of the new methodology of the EDA are wide because it concerns the very foundation of data analysis. Preliminary tests show its good performance in comparison to traditional techniques.

AB On-road vehicle has been a prominent emission source, hence a key target of control for environment, health, and climate concerns. While considerable efforts have been made to investigate criteria pollutants such as adverse gaseous and particulate emissions across the world, there is limited systematic research to characterize on-road carbon emissions, especially as countries strive to set and achieve various climate goals (i.e., carbon neutrality, carbon peaking by a certain year, etc.) through cleaner vehicle technologies such as the latest vehicle emission standard, China VI (2020). This study used the portable emission measurement system (PEMS) to reveal the real-world emissions from two light-duty gasoline vehicles, one meeting the China V standard and the other China VI. The PEMS measurements were performed secondly in urban and suburban areas respectively, and finally yielded 10 h of rich and finely resolved emissions data. In addition of single-factor analysis, this study employed two machine learning models, stepwise regression and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), to investigate the coupling effects among vehicle/traffic parameters and identify driving behavior, engine condi-tion, and external environment as key determining factors that affect vehicular carbon emissions. In particular, engine load percent and engine speed were confirmed to be the most dominant factors affecting vehicular carbon emissions under both China V and China VI standards, explaining similar to 60% of variability in carbon emissions. As a result, vehicle specific power (VSP) is derived from vehicle travel parameters and used as a surrogate for carbon emission estimation. The external facility and environmental factors turned out significant as well in affecting vehicle carbon emissions: carbon emissions from the same vehicle were significantly higher in an urban setting then in suburban areas, mostly due to the more aggressive driving patterns in congested urban traffic. Travelling under relatively better traffic conditions on expressways gave the lowest per-distance emission factors of CO2, CO, and NOx. Comparing between the China V and VI vehicle, our PEMS data show significant carbon emission reduction benefits (15.9% in CO2, 28.8% in CO) as we move to the new China VI standard, although such benefit was not observed in NOx emissions.

AB Due to the inherent periodic nature of cycling tasks, iterative and repetitive learning controllers are well motivated for rehabilitative cycling. Motorized functional electrical stimulation induced cycling is a rehabilitation treatment where multiple lower-limb muscle groups are activated jointly with an electric motor to achieve cycling objectives such as speed (cadence) and torque tracking. This paper examines torque tracking accomplished by the stimulation of six lower-limb muscles via a novel spatial repetitive learning control and cadence regulation by an electric motor using a sliding-mode controller. A desired torque trajectory is constructed based on the rider's kinematic efficiency, which is a function of the crank position. The learning controller takes advantage of the periodicity of the desired torque trajectory to provide a feedforward input to the stimulated muscles. A passivity-based analysis is developed to ensure stability of the torque and cadence closed-loop error systems. The muscle learning and electric motor controllers were implemented in real-time during cycling experiments on five able-bodied individuals and three participants with movement disorders. The combined average cadence tracking error was 0.01 +/- 1.20 RPM for a 50 RPM trajectory and the combined average power tracking error was 1.78 +/- 1.25 W for a peak power of 10 W.

AB In networked control systems (NCS), agents participating in a network share their data with others to work together. When agents share their data, they can naturally expose the NCS to layers of faults and cyber-attacks, which can contribute to the propagation of error from one agent/area to another within the system. One common type of attack in which adversaries corrupt information within a NCS is called a false data injection (FDI) attack. This article proposes a control scheme, which enables a NCS to detect and mitigate FDI attacks and, at the same time, compensate for measurement noise and process noise. Furthermore, the developed controller is designed to be robust to unknown inputs. The algorithm incorporates a Kalman filter as an observer to estimate agents' states. We also develop a neural network (NN) architecture to detect and respond to any anomalies caused by FDI attacks. The weights of the NN are updated using an extended Kalman filter, which significantly improves the accuracy of FDI detection. A simulation of the results is provided, which illustrates satisfactory performance of the developed method to accurately detect and respond to FDI attacks.

AB Synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) intensity statistics are dependent upon the sensing geometry at the time of capture. Estimating bathymetry from acoustic surveys is challenging. While several methods have been proposed to estimate seabed relief via intensity, we develop the first large-scale study that relies on deep learning models. In this work, we pose bathymetric estimation from SAS surveys as a domain translation problem of translating intensity to height. Since no dataset of coregistered seabed relief maps and sonar imagery previously existed to learn this domain translation, we produce the first large simulated dataset containing coregistered pairs of seabed relief and intensity maps from two unique sonar data simulation techniques. We apply four types of models, with varying complexity, to translate intensity imagery to seabed relief: a shape-from-shading (SFS) approach, a Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) approach, a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN), and UNet architectures. Each model is applied to datasets containing sand ripples, rocky, mixed, and flat sea bottoms. Methods are compared in reference to the coregistered simulated datasets using L1 error. Additionally, we provide results on simulated and real SAS imagery. Our results indicate that the proposed UNet architectures outperform an SFS, a GMRF, and a pix2pix cGAN model.

AB Cutaneous malignancies affecting the ear, exacerbated by extensive ultraviolet (UV) exposure, pose intricate challenges owing to the organ's complex anatomy. This article investigates how the anatomy contributes to late-stage diagnoses and ensuing complexities in surgical interventions. Mohs Micrographic Surgery (MMS), acknowledged as the gold standard for treating most cutaneous malignancies of the ear, ensures superior margin control and cure rates. However, the ear's intricacy necessitates careful consideration of tissue availability and aesthetic outcomes. The manuscript explores new technologies like Reflectance Confocal Microscopy (RCM), Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), High-Frequency, High-Resolution Ultrasound (HFHRUS), and Raman spectroscopy (RS). These technologies hold the promise of enhancing diagnostic accuracy and providing real-time visualization of excised tissue, thereby improving tumor margin assessments. Dermoscopy continues to be a valuable non-invasive tool for identifying malignant lesions. Staining methods in Mohs surgery are discussed, emphasizing hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) as the gold standard for evaluating tumor margins. Toluidine blue is explored for potential applications in assessing basal cell carcinomas (BCC), and immunohistochemical staining is considered for detecting proteins associated with specific malignancies. As MMS and imaging technologies advance, a thorough evaluation of their practicality, cost-effectiveness, and benefits becomes essential for enhancing surgical outcomes and patient care. The potential synergy of artificial intelligence with these innovations holds promise in revolutionizing tumor detection and improving the efficacy of cutaneous malignancy treatments.

AB Highly portable and accessible MRI technology will allow researchers to conduct field-based MRI research in community settings. Previous guidance for researchers working with fixed MRI does not address the novel ethical, legal, and societal issues (ELSI) of portable MRI (pMRI). Our interdisciplinary Working Group (WG) previously identified 15 core ELSI challenges associated with pMRI research and recommended solutions. In this article, we distill those detailed recommendations into a Portable MRI Research ELSI Checklist that offers practical operational guidance for researchers contemplating using this technology.

TI MicroSegNet: A deep learning approach for prostate segmentation on
   micro-ultrasound images
SO COMPUTERIZED MEDICAL IMAGING AND GRAPHICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Image segmentation; Micro-ultrasound; Deep learning; Prostate cancer
AB Micro -ultrasound (micro -US) is a novel 29 -MHz ultrasound technique that provides 3-4 times higher resolution than traditional ultrasound, potentially enabling low-cost, accurate diagnosis of prostate cancer. Accurate prostate segmentation is crucial for prostate volume measurement, cancer diagnosis, prostate biopsy, and treatment planning. However, prostate segmentation on micro -US is challenging due to artifacts and indistinct borders between the prostate, bladder, and urethra in the midline. This paper presents MicroSegNet, a multiscale annotation -guided transformer UNet model designed specifically to tackle these challenges. During the training process, MicroSegNet focuses more on regions that are hard to segment (hard regions), characterized by discrepancies between expert and non -expert annotations. We achieve this by proposing an annotationguided binary cross entropy (AG -BCE) loss that assigns a larger weight to prediction errors in hard regions and a lower weight to prediction errors in easy regions. The AG -BCE loss was seamlessly integrated into the training process through the utilization of multi -scale deep supervision, enabling MicroSegNet to capture global contextual dependencies and local information at various scales. We trained our model using micro -US images from 55 patients, followed by evaluation on 20 patients. Our MicroSegNet model achieved a Dice coefficient of 0.939 and a Hausdorff distance of 2.02 mm, outperforming several state-of-the-art segmentation methods, as well as three human annotators with different experience levels. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/mirthAI/MicroSegNet and our dataset is publicly available at https://zenodo.org/records/ 10475293.

AB This paper explains the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to segment solar panels in a satellite image containing solar arrays, and extract associated metadata from the arrays. A novel unsupervised technique is introduced to estimate the azimuth of each individual solar panel from the predicted mask of the convolutional neural network. This pipeline was developed with the aim of extracting necessary metadata for a solar installation, using only a set of latitude-longitude coordinates. Azimuth prediction results for 669 individual solar installations associated with 387 sites located across the United States are provided. A mean average error and median average error of 21.65 degrees and 1.0 degrees were obtained, respectively, when predicting the azimuth of the solar fleet data set, with about 80% of the results within an error of zero degrees of the ground truth azimuth value and about 85% within an error of 25 degrees. The predicted azimuth was then used to estimate the energy conversion of the solar arrays. Results show a 90.9 and 90.6 R-squared value for estimating alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) energy, respectively, and a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 1.70% in estimating the alternating current (AC) energy using the fully automated algorithm.

DE Minimum average correlation energy; Pattern recognition; Correntropy;
   Random projection; Dimensionality reduction; Face recognition
AB The minimum average correlation energy (MACE) filter is a well known correlation filter for object recognition. Recently, a nonlinear extension to the MACE filter using the correntropy function in feature space has been introduced. Correntropy is a positive definite function that generalizes the concept of correlation by utilizing higher order moment information of signal structure. Since the MACE is a spatial matched filter for an image class, the correntropy MACE (CMACE) can potentially improve its performance. Both the MACE and CMACE are basically memory-based algorithms and due to the high dimensionality of the image data, the computational cost of the CMACE filter is one of the critical issues in practical applications. We propose to use a dimensionality reduction method based on random projections (RP), which has emerged as a powerful method for dimensionality reduction in machine learning. We apply the CMACE filter with random projection (CMACE-RP) to face recognition and show that it indeed outperforms the traditional linear MACE in both generalization and rejection abilities with small degradation in performance, but great savings in storage and computational complexity.

AB Hardware intellectual property (IP) piracy and misuse have introduced new challenges in the semiconductor industry as untrusted parties in the IP's life cycle may clone, reverse-engineer, or extract important design secrets from an IP. A promising solution to protect a hardware IP against such attacks is to perform logic locking, where additional logic controlled by a secret key is inserted in strategic locations of an IP to lock the functionality when the correct key is not available. As a multitude of logic locking techniques has emerged in the past decade, the research community has also developed strong attacks against them to expose various vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an adversary to break the protection. While state-of-the-art logic locking solutions have demonstrated provable robustness against known attacks, there is a critical need to explore new attack vectors and mitigate them to achieve a higher level of protection. In this article, we present SCOPE, a novel synthesis-based constant propagation attack for security evaluation of logic locking techniques. SCOPE is oracle-less and requires no knowledge about the locking algorithm or the locked design by an attacker. The introduced attack performs a synthesis-based analysis on each individual key-input port and looks for meaningful design features that may help derive the correct key value. SCOPE offers two attack modes with varying complexity and effectiveness, a linear regression test, and an unsupervised machine-learning analysis. We perform SCOPE to a number of existing locking techniques and demonstrate that the average attack accuracy is 84.13% with high scalability in terms of design size. Based on the vulnerabilities identified by SCOPE, we provide a low-overhead countermeasure that can help mitigate such constant propagation attacks.

AB Global excessive antibiotic use has created widespread multi-drug resistance and increased antibiotic waste. Research mitigating antibiotic resistance is growing, but less attention has been shown towards sustainable antibiotic waste management. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of antibiotic waste management by incorporating environmental, economic, and societal sustainability practices compounded with innovative valorization techniques and machine learning tool. Findings established the importance of pre-treating antibiotic waste prior to disposal by adding pharmaceutical processing residues (PPRs) and antibiotic fermentation residues (AFRs) to value-added products like PPR derived biofuel, beta-lactam waste-based chlorhexidine GUMBOS, and AFR- & wastewater treatment plant (WWTP)-based biofertilizers and biochar, and also explored the trending topics of antibiotic waste valorization towards circular economy by machine learning technique. The transformation of antibiotic waste through various valorization techniques holds potential to address disposal issues by eliminating the entry of hazardous antibiotic compounds into the environment and simultaneously creating new value-added products. This contributes to environmental sustainability and generates employment opportunities. Current challenges to valorization techniques include improved sustainable and cleaner production technologies to add antibiotic waste value-added products to energy and agricultural sectors.

AB The gradual increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations has attracted worldwide attention for its strong relationships with global climate change. Considerable efforts are being undertaken to characterize spatiotemporal variations of CO2 at a city, regional and national level, aiming at providing pipelines for carbon emission reduction. However, there is scarce knowledge of how CO2 at the urban neighborhood scale is produced and distributed in the context of time and space, which is useful to accurately target source contributions from the ground up and reduce carbon emissions at a fine-grained scale. In this study, mobile measurements of CO2 concentrations were made in a 2 km x 2 km urban area covering different land use types to separately characterize the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of CO2 in roadside, residential and green space areas. The results show that CO2 concentrations in the late afternoon (Local time, UTC+8, LT 17-18) were higher than those at noon (LT 11-12), and that CO2 concentrations in winter were higher than those in summer. The roadside areas exhibited the highest CO2 concentration level of 452.66 +/- 20.59 ppm, followed by residential areas (436.34 +/-; 27.02 ppm) and green space areas (428.98 +/- 20.49 ppm). The result indicates that traffic sources brought more carbon emissions and contributed to a significant increase in CO2 concentrations, while urban greenery caused more carbon absorptions and reduced CO2 concentrations. This can be further confirmed by the observations that CO(2)concentrations in the roadside neighborhood showed a strong positive correlation (R-2 = 0.86) with ambient traffic flow. Then two machine learning models, i.e., Random Forest and eXtreme Gradient Boost, were developed to quantify the individual contribution from different carbon emission sources to the CO2 distributions, including traffic flow, greening rate, and domestic energy consumption. The results show that traffic-related carbon emissions were the most important influencing factor and accounted for approximately 60% of ambient CO2 concentrations, followed by greening rate (20%) and domestic energy consumption (10%). These findings can provide insights into spatiotemporal distributions and source contributions of CO(2 & nbsp;)in urban neighborhoods and show huge potentials for reducing urban carbon emissions at a fine-grained scale.

AB This paper presents a theoretical approach to understand the basic dynamics of a hierarchical and realistic computational model of the olfactory system proposed by W. J. Freeman. While the system's parameter space could be scanned to obtain the desired dynamical behavior, our approach exploits the hierarchical organization and focuses on understanding the simplest building block of this highly connected network. Based on bifurcation analysis, we obtain analytical solutions of how to control the qualitative behavior of a reduced KII set taking into consideration both the internal coupling coefficients and the external stimulus. This also provides useful insights for investigating higher level structures that are composed of the same basic structure. Experimental results are presented to verify our theoretical analysis.

ID DATA MINING TECHNIQUES; MANAGEMENT FRAUD; MODEL
AB A fraudulent financial statement involves the intentional furnishing and/or publishing of false information in it and this has become a severe economic and social problem. We consider Data Mining (DM) based financial fraud detection techniques (such as regression, decision tree, neural networks and Bayesian networks) that help identify fraud. The effectiveness of these DM methods (and their limitations) is examined, especially when new schemes of financial statement fraud adapt to the detection techniques. We then explore a self-adaptive framework (based on a response surface model) with domain knowledge to detect financial statement fraud. We conclude by suggesting that, in an era with evolutionary financial frauds, computer assisted automated fraud detection mechanisms will be more effective and efficient with specialized domain knowledge.

AB A new power grid PV-based generation technology presentes engineering challenges in regards to the control and operation of energy storage. Because the utility grid has bidirectional power-flow and further intelligent protection for intentional and unintentional islanding is required. Further, the high penetration of photovoltaics may increase active power losses, and reconfiguration studies must be conducted to analyze such losses and thus optimize system operation. Model based solutions become intractable considering the size of the search space. In this work a Binary Particle Swarm Optimization based solution is presented aiming distribution systems technical power losses reduction though system reconfiguration. Solution validation is carried on the IEEE 37 buses test feeder. A feasibility test is also addressed, and the results show that the BPSO and the use of energy storage systems are efficiently merged resulting in an electric distribution network reconfiguration optimized for PV distributed generation and energy storage, that can retrofit into existing power systems.

AB There are significant challenges to identifying which individuals require intervention following exposure to trauma, and a need for strategies to identify and provide individuals at risk for developing PTSD with timely interventions. The present study seeks to identify a minimal set of trauma -related symptoms, assessed during the weeks following traumatic exposure, that can accurately predict PTSD. Participants were 2185 adults (Mean age =36.4 years; 64% women; 50% Black) presenting for emergency care following traumatic exposure. Participants received a 'flash survey ' with 6 -8 varying symptoms (from a pool of 26 trauma symptoms) several times per week for eight weeks following the trauma exposure (each symptom assessed similar to 6 times). Features (mean, sd, last, worst, peak-end scores) from the repeatedly assessed symptoms were included as candidate variables in a CART machine learning analysis to develop a pragmatic predictive algorithm. PTSD (PCL-5 >= 38) was present for 669 (31%) participants at the 8-week follow-up. A classification tree with three splits, based on mean scores of nervousness, rehashing, and fatigue, predicted PTSD with an Area Under the Curve of 0.836. Findings suggest feasibility for a 3 -item assessment protocol, delivered once per week, following traumatic exposure to assess and potentially facilitate follow-up care for those at risk.

ID METAANALYSIS
AB Purpose of ReviewExcessive alcohol use is a major public health concern. With increasing access to mobile technology, novel mHealth approaches for alcohol misuse, such as ecological momentary intervention (EMI), can be implemented widely to deliver treatment content in real time to diverse populations. This review summarizes the state of research in this area with an emphasis on the potential role of wearable alcohol biosensors in future EMI/just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI) for alcohol use.Recent FindingsJITAI emerged as an intervention design to optimize the delivery of EMI for various health behaviors including substance use. Alcohol biosensors present an opportunity to augment JITAI/EMI for alcohol use with objective information on drinking behavior captured passively and continuously in participants' daily lives, but no prior published studies have incorporated wearable alcohol biosensors into JITAI for alcohol-related problems. Several methodological advances are needed to accomplish this goal and advance the field. Future research should focus on developing standardized data processing, analysis, and interpretation methods for wrist-worn biosensor data. Machine learning algorithms could be used to identify risk factors (e.g., stress, craving, physical locations) for high-risk drinking and develop decision rules for interpreting biosensor-derived transdermal alcohol concentration (TAC) data. Finally, advanced trial design such as micro-randomized trials (MRT) could facilitate the development of biosensor-augmented JITAI.SummaryWrist-worn alcohol biosensors are a promising potential addition to improve mHealth and JITAI for alcohol use. Additional research is needed to improve biosensor data analysis and interpretation, build new machine learning models to facilitate integration of alcohol biosensors into novel intervention strategies, and test and refine biosensor-augmented JITAI using advanced trial design.

AB As escalating environmental pressures threaten the world's river systems, understanding the driving factors influencing their geomorphological changes is of critical global importance. This study illuminates the complex interaction between natural and anthropogenic factors that drove geomorphological changes along the upper Apalachicola River (UAR) from 1960 to 2010. This study utilized LiDAR point cloud data and hydrographic surveys conducted between 1960 and 2010 to identify the primary factors driving riverbed changes. A triangular irregular network (TIN) was used to convert the combined datasets from each survey, following coordinate transformation, into a 1.5 m-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) raster. The DEM of difference (DEMoD) was computed by subtracting the 1960 DEM from that of 2010, and the total sediment loss and gain were then determined by multiplying the DEMoD by the DEM resolution. A random forest (RF) regression model was used to determine the most influential factors contributing to riverbed deformation. The results revealed substantial differences in sediment loss and gain across the river. The UAR, divided into three segments, experienced sediment loss of about -6.56 x 10(6) m(3) between 1960 and 2010, with the farthest upstream section (RM 106 to 98) losing -3.14 x 10(6) m(3), which is similar to 48 % of the sediment losses in the study area. Some sections of the channel have deepened significantly, with a pronounced depth difference of -17.20 m between RM 92 and 94, potentially caused by the presence of limestone and the enlargement of a sinkhole or spring on the riverbed. The RF model identified the dam (> 28 %) as the most crucial anthropogenic factor in riverbed deformation, followed by the presence of dikes (similar to 17-18 %), then historical dredging (similar to 7-8 %), highlighting the substantial impact of artificial structures on riverbed deformation. In contrast, rock removal, while potentially impactful in certain locations, had negligible effects (> 0.5 %) at the system scale. This study highlights the interaction of natural and anthropogenic factors in river geomorphology and the potential for machine learning to identify these dynamics and inform data-driven river management and conservation strategies.

AB An in-vehicle controller area network (CAN) bus is vulnerable because of increased sharing among modern autonomous vehicles and the weak protocol design principle. Spoofing attacks on a CAN bus can be difficult to detect and have the potential to enable devastating attacks. To effectively identify spoofing attacks, we propose the authentication of sender identities using a recurrent neural network with long short-term memory units (RNN-LSTM) based on the features of a fingerprint signal. We also present a way to generate the analog fingerprint signals of electronic control units (ECUs) to train the proposed RNN-LSTM classifier. The proposed RNN-LSTM model is accelerated on embedded Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) to allow for real-time detection despite high computational complexity. A comparison of experimental results with the latest studies demonstrates the capability of the proposed RNN-LSTM model and its potential as a solution to in-vehicle CAN bus security.

DT Review
DE Mixed reality; After action review; Anesthesia machine; Human patient
   simulator; User studies; Skin prepping
AB After action review (AAR) is a widely used training practice in which trainees and trainers review past training experiences and performance for the purpose of learning. AAR has often been conducted with video-based systems whereby a video of the action is reviewed afterward, usually at another location. This paper proposes collocated AAR of training experiences through mixed reality (MR). Collocated AAR allows users to review past training experiences in situ with the user's current, real-world experience, i.e., the AAR is conducted at the same location where the action being reviewed occurred. MR enables a user-controlled egocentric viewpoint, augmentation such as a visual overlay of virtual information like conceptual visualizations, and playback of recorded training experiences collocated with the user's current experience or that of an expert. Collocated AAR presents novel challenges for MR, such as collocating time, interactions, and visualizations of previous and current experiences. We created a collocated AAR system for anesthesia education, the augmented anesthesia machine visualization, and interactive debriefing system. The system enables collocated AAR in two applications related to anesthesia training: anesthesia machine operation training and skin disinfection training with a mannequin patient simulator. Collocated AAR was evaluated in two informal pilot studies by students (n = 19) and an educator (n = 1) not directly affiliated with the project. We review the anecdotal data collected from the studies and point toward ways to refine and improve collocated AAR.

AB Social cues have been construed as an important concept in human-robot interaction, as they can be manipulated to reflect robots' perceived genders, personalities, emotions, identities, and so on. This study seeks to understand the overall effects of social cues and applies two meta-analyses to explore a hierarchy of social cues that elicits different degrees of users' social responses. A total of 25 and 44 effect sizes were calculated to represent the respective magnitudes of the effects of social cues on users' social presence (N = 2498) and trust in social robots (N = 4147). Results suggested that although the overall effects of social cues were small, manipulating social robots' facial and kinetic cues can induce medium-to-large-sized effects on users' social presence and trust. In addition, the overall positive effect sizes of social cues indicated that designing humanlike, natural, and lifelike cues was effective in evoking users' social presence and trust in social robots. The results of the two meta-analyses can contribute to the theoretical implications of the Computers are Social Actors paradigm and the practical and methodological design of human-robot interaction.

DE cover and crop management factor; feedforward neural network; hot-deck
   imputation; universal soil loss equation
AB Imputation is needed in almost all major Surveys. Imputation tools are often adopted according to the convenience and the contexts of the surveys. Traditional hot-deck imputation needs extensive knowledge of the survey variables. Explicit model-based imputation needs a valid model for every survey variable. In large-scale national surveys, different groups of people with different backgrounds work oil different stages of surveys and often the statistical estimation group has little or insufficient communication with the other groups. In such situations, it is difficult to use hot-deck imputation. On the other hand, because of the complex nature of the survey, finding a suitable model for every survey variable may not be easy and thus a nonparametric method-such as neural network imputation-may be attractive. One such large-scale national survey is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Resources Inventory Survey (NRI). By design, the survey has missing values. The missing values are imputed using a donor-based method. This article develops a neural network imputation model and compares its performance with that of the existing imputation method. The end result looks promising.

ID NEURAL MECHANISMS; FEEDBACK
AB Emergency response (ER) workers perform extremely demanding physical and cognitive tasks that can result in serious injuries and loss of life. Human augmentation technologies have the potential to enhance physical and cognitive work-capacities, thereby dramatically transforming the landscape of ER work, reducing injury risk, improving ER, as well as helping attract and retain skilled ER workers. This opportunity has been significantly hindered by the lack of high-quality training for ER workers that effectively integrates innovative and intelligent augmentation solutions. Hence, new ER learning environments are needed that are adaptive, affordable, accessible, and continually available for reskilling the ER workforce as technological capabilities continue to improve. This article presents the research considerations in the design and integration of use-inspired exoskeletons and augmented reality technologies in ER processes and the identification of unique cognitive and motor learning needs of each of these technologies in context-independent and ER-relevant scenarios. We propose a human-centered artificial intelligence (AI) enabled training framework for these technologies in ER. Finally, how these human-centered training requirements for nascent technologies are integrated in an intelligent tutoring system that delivers across tiered access levels, covering the range of virtual, to mixed, to physical reality environments, is discussed.

AB Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown an effective way to learn spatiotemporal representation for action recognition in videos. However, most traditional action recognition algorithms do not employ the attention mechanism to focus on essential parts of video frames that are relevant to the action. In this article, we propose a novel global and local knowledge-aware attention network to address this challenge for action recognition. The proposed network incorporates two types of attention mechanism called statistic-based attention (SA) and learning-based attention (LA) to attach higher importance to the crucial elements in each video frame. As global pooling (GP) models capture global information, while attention models focus on the significant details to make full use of their implicit complementary advantages, our network adopts a three-stream architecture, including two attention streams and a GP stream. Each attention stream employs a fusion layer to combine global and local information and produces composite features. Furthermore, global-attention (GA) regularization is proposed to guide two attention streams to better model dynamics of composite features with the reference to the global information. Fusion at the softmax layer is adopted to make better use of the implicit complementary advantages between SA, LA, and GP streams and get the final comprehensive predictions. The proposed network is trained in an end-to-end fashion and learns efficient video-level features both spatially and temporally. Extensive experiments are conducted on three challenging benchmarks, Kinetics, HMDB51, and UCF101, and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network outperforms most state-of-the-art methods.

AB Evidence has shown a strong association between ambient particulate matter and adverse health problems. In urban areas, most of households are located near arterial roads, which are exposure to fine particulate matter directly. Hence, it is critical to understand the near-road fine particulate matter concentration and distribution for the purpose of health risk analysis. This paper applies artificial neural network to estimate the near-road fine particulate matter concentration. Factors influencing the detected concentration are classified into four categories: traffic-related, weather-related, detection location-related and background-related. The estimated values are compared with concentrations detected by monitoring campaigns in Gainesville, FL and Shanghai, China. Distinguished from previous research, this study illustrates the fine particulate matter dispersion and distribution within 50 m near road with portable fine particulate matter detectors and weather instruments. The results indicate that artificial neural network approach is capable of producing accurate estimation of pollutant dispersion near road. Besides, fine particulate matter concentration decayed about a half at 30 m distance from an arterial road in Gainesville, FL. Background contributes to more than 2/3 of the detected value at roadside in Shanghai, and the distance-decay pattern is not as obvious as that in Gainesville, which is different from previous studies reported in the literature. An artificial neural network model performs better after removing the background concentration and with higher concentration value of fine particulate matter.

AB The most common approach to create spatial prediction of malaria in the literature is to approximate a Gaussian process model using stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE). We compared SPDE to computationally faster alternatives, generalized additive model (GAM) and state-of-the-art machine learning method gradient boosted trees (GBM), with respect to their predictive skill for country-level malaria prevalence mapping. We also evaluated the intuition that incorporation of past data and the use of spatiotemporal models may improve predictive accuracy of present spatial distribution of malaria. Model performances varied among the countries and setting with SPDE and GAM performed well generally. The inclusion of past data is beneficial for GAM and GBM, but not for SPDE. We further investigated the weaknesses of SPDE at spatio-temporal setting and GAM at the edges of the countries. Taken together, we believe that spatial/spatio-temporal SPDE models should be evaluated alongside with the alternatives or at least GAM.

AB Here we provide an overview of findings and viewpoints on the mechanisms of sensorimotor learning presented at the 2016 Biomechanics and Neural Control of Movement (BANCOM) conference in Deer Creek, OH. This field has shown substantial growth in the past couple of decades. For example it is now well accepted that neural systems outside of primary motor pathways play a role in learning. Frontoparietal and anterior cingulate networks contribute to sensorimotor adaptation, reflecting strategic aspects of exploration and learning. Longer term training results in functional and morphological changes in primary motor and somatosensory cortices. Interestingly, re-engagement of strategic processes once a skill has become well learned may disrupt performance. Efforts to predict individual differences in learning rate have enhanced our understanding of the neural, behavioral, and genetic factors underlying skilled human performance. Access to genomic analyses has dramatically increased over the past several years. This has enhanced our understanding of cellular processes underlying the expression of human behavior, including involvement of various neurotransmitters, receptors, and enzymes. Surprisingly our field has been slow to adopt such approaches in studying neural control, although this work does require much larger sample sizes than are typically used to investigate skill learning. We advocate that individual differences approaches can lead to new insights into human sensorimotor performance. Moreover, a greater understanding of the factors underlying the wide range of performance capabilities seen across individuals can promote personalized medicine and refinement of rehabilitation strategies, which stand to be more effective than "one size fits all" treatments.

AB Objective Measurement of health-related social needs (HRSNs) is complex. We sought to develop and validate computable phenotypes (CPs) using structured electronic health record (EHR) data for food insecurity, housing instability, financial insecurity, transportation barriers, and a composite-type measure of these, using human-defined rule-based and machine learning (ML) classifier approaches.Materials and Methods We collected HRSN surveys as the reference standard and obtained EHR data from 1550 patients in 3 health systems from 2 states. We followed a Delphi-like approach to develop the human-defined rule-based CP. For the ML classifier approach, we trained supervised ML (XGBoost) models using 78 features. Using surveys as the reference standard, we calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values, and area under the curve (AUC). We compared AUCs using the Delong test and other performance measures using McNemar's test, and checked for differential performance.Results Most patients (63%) reported at least one HRSN on the reference standard survey. Human-defined rule-based CPs exhibited poor performance (AUCs=.52 to .68). ML classifier CPs performed significantly better, but still poor-to-fair (AUCs = .68 to .75). Significant differences for race/ethnicity were found for ML classifier CPs (higher AUCs for White non-Hispanic patients). Important features included number of encounters and Medicaid insurance.Discussion Using a supervised ML classifier approach, HRSN CPs approached thresholds of fair performance, but exhibited differential performance by race/ethnicity.Conclusion CPs may help to identify patients who may benefit from additional social needs screening. Future work should explore the use of area-level features via geospatial data and natural language processing to improve model performance.
   Health-related social needs (HRSNs), such as food insecurity and housing instability, can impact patients' health. For health systems to address these needs, they need an effective way to measure them. The standard approach to measurement of HRSNs, surveying patients, is challenging due to the time and resources needed to survey each patient. Toward an alternative approach, we sought to determine if patient information from their electronic health records (EHRs) could serve as a "computable phenotype" (a representation of patient characteristics using data that is combined into a set of features and logical expressions) to identify patients with HRSNs. Using 2 different approaches to developing potential computable phenotypes for HRSNs (a human-defined rule-based approach and a machine learning approach), we found that the computable phenotypes in the current study were poor-to-fair at accurately identifying patients with HRSNs and that the phenotype performance was poorer for patients who were non-White and/or Hispanic. Future work could seek to improve the computable phenotypes by including additional data, such as clinical notes.

AB The deep brain stimulation (DBS) Think Tank X was held on August 17-19, 2022 in Orlando FL. The session organizers and moderators were all women with the theme women in neuromodulation. Dr. Helen Mayberg from Mt. Sinai, NY was the keynote speaker. She discussed milestones and her experiences in developing depression DBS. The DBS Think Tank was founded in 2012 and provides an open platform where clinicians, engineers and researchers (from industry and academia) can freely discuss current and emerging DBS technologies as well as the logistical and ethical issues facing the field. The consensus among the DBS Think Tank X speakers was that DBS has continued to expand in scope however several indications have reached the "trough of disillusionment." DBS for depression was considered as "re-emerging" and approaching a slope of enlightenment. DBS for depression will soon re-enter clinical trials. The group estimated that globally more than 244,000 DBS devices have been implanted for neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. This year's meeting was focused on advances in the following areas: neuromodulation in Europe, Asia, and Australia; cutting-edge technologies, closed loop DBS, DBS tele-health, neuroethics, lesion therapy, interventional psychiatry, and adaptive DBS.

AB We embodied networks of cultured biological neurons in simulation and in robotics. This is a new research paradigm to study learning, memory, and information processing in real time: the Neurally-Controlled Animat. Neural activity was subject to detailed electrical and optical observation using multi-electrode arrays and microscopy in order to access the neural correlates of animat behavior. Neurobiology has given inspiration to AI since the advent of the perceptron and consequent artificial neural networks, developed using local properties of individual neurons. We wish to continue this trend by studying the network processing of ensembles of living neurons that lead to higher-level cognition and intelligent behavior.

ID PLASMODIUM-FALCIPARUM; RISK; POPULATION; PREVALENCE; AFRICA
AB The most common approach to create spatial prediction of malaria in the literature is to approximate a Gaussian process model using stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE). We compared SPDE to computationally faster alternatives, generalized additive model (GAM) and state-of-the-art machine learning method gradient boosted trees (GBM), with respect to their predictive skill for country-level malaria prevalence mapping. We also evaluated the intuition that incorporation of past data and the use of spatiotemporal models may improve predictive accuracy of present spatial distribution of malaria. Model performances varied among the countries and setting with SPDE and GAM performed well generally. The inclusion of past data is beneficial for GAM and GBM, but not for SPDE. We further investigated the weaknesses of SPDE at spatio-temporal setting and GAM at the edges of the countries. Taken together, we believe that spatial/spatio-temporal SPDE models should be evaluated alongside with the alternatives or at least GAM. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Karenia brevis blooms occur nearly annually along the southwest coast of Florida, and effective mitigation of ecological, public health, and economic impacts requires reliable real-time forecasting. We present two boosted random forest models that predict the weekly maximum K. brevis abundance category across the Greater Charlotte Harbor estuaries over one-week and four-week forecast horizons. The feature set was restricted to data available in near-real time, consistent with adoption of the models as decision-support tools. Features include current and lagged K. brevis abundance statistics, Loop Current position, sea surface temperature, sea level, and riverine discharges and nitrogen concentrations. During cross-validation, the one-week and four-week forecasts exhibited 73 % and 84 % accuracy, respectively, during the 2010-2023 study period. In addition, we assessed the models' reliability in forecasting the onset of 10 bloom events on time or in advance; the one-week and fourweek models anticipated the onset eight times and five times, respectively.

AB Background: To examine patient characteristics that may modulate the heterogeneous treatment effect of intensive systolic blood pressure control (SBP) and intensive glycemic control on incident heart failure (HF) risk in people with type 2 diabetes.Methods: We analyzed 10,251 participants from the ACCORD glucose trial, and 4733 from the SBP sub-trial separately. We applied a robust machine-learning (ML) algorithm, namely the causal forest/causal tree anal-ysis, to each trial to identify participants' characteristics that modulate the effectiveness of each trial intervention.Results: Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was found to interact with intensive glycemic control and impact out-comes. An increased HF risk associated with intensive glycemic control (absolute risk change (ARC): 2.28 %, 95 % confidence interval (CI): 0.69 % to 3.90 %; relative risk (RR):1.57, 95 % CI: 1.15 to 2.20; P < 0.05) was observed in individuals with baseline DBP at the lowest tertile (45-69 mmHg), while no changes in HF risk associated with intensive glycemic control were observed in individuals with baseline DBP at the middle (70-79 mmHg) and the highest tertiles (80-100 mmHg). Liver function was identified as a modulator of intensive BP control, and baseline Alanine transaminase (ALT) level was a sensitive marker for the modulating effect. Only individuals with baseline ALT at the lowest tertile (8-19 mg/dl) benefited from the intensive BP control for HF prevention (ARC:-1.95 %, 95 % CI:-4.06 % to 0.11 %; RR:0.62. 95 % CI: 0.27 to 0.94; P < 0.05).Conclusions: Our study is the first to observe and quantify the potential synergistic harmful effect when low DBP was combined with an intensive blood glucose intervention. Recognizing these may help clinicians develop a more precise approach to such treatments, thus increasing the efficiency and outcomes of diabetes treatments.

DT Article
DE Mobile security; webpages; web browsers; machine learning
AB Mobile specific webpages differ significantly from their desktop counterparts in content, layout, and functionality. Accordingly, existing techniques to detect malicious websites are unlikely to work for such webpages. In this paper, we design and implement kAYO, a mechanism that distinguishes between malicious and benign mobile webpages. kAYO makes this determination based on static features of a webpage ranging from the number of iframes to the presence of known fraudulent phone numbers. First, we experimentally demonstrate the need for mobile specific techniques and then identify a range of new static features that highly correlate with mobile malicious webpages. We then apply kAYO to a dataset of over 350,000 known benign and malicious mobile webpages and demonstrate 90 percent accuracy in classification. Moreover, we discover, characterize, and report a number of webpages missed by Google Safe Browsing and VirusTotal, but detected by kAYO. Finally, we build a browser extension using kAYO to protect users from malicious mobile websites in real-time. In doing so, we provide the first static analysis technique to detect malicious mobile webpages.

AB Acculturative stress is associated with poor mental health outcomes; however, few studies have examined this type of stress within immigrants' broader social-ecological context. Furthermore, it remains unclear which stressors are unique to first-generation immigrants, who are at a higher risk of experiencing acculturative stress during intercultural contact. Informed by the socialecological framework, this scoping review examines the unique and integrative correlates of acculturative stress among first-generation Latina/o and Black Caribbean immigrants, and articulates social-ecologically based recommendations. Forty articles published in peer-reviewed journals between 2000 and 2019 were examined. Correlates of acculturative stress were organized across five levels of influence: individual, interpersonal, institutional, community, and policy. Language barriers, personal experiences in the U.S., socioeconomic status, religion, coping strategies, ethnic beliefs and values, social support, family dynamics, fears related to status, neighborhood characteristics, and discrimination were significant correlates of acculturative stress. Existing research assessing social-ecological correlates of acculturative stress addressed primarily individual and interpersonal level factors, limiting the explanatory power of this review in identifying how root causes of acculturative stress intersect and ultimately influence mental health. Overreliance on a small amount of national or large data sets, lack of variation in research design, and limited research among Afro-Latina/o and Black Caribbean immigrants all contribute to the restricted boundaries of this area of study. Unlike many factors that influence immigrant mental health, acculturative stress is potentially modifiable through social-ecological levels of intervention; thus, we offer recommendations that could be implemented to facilitate psychological adjustments and reduce risk for mental illness.

AB An object-oriented modeling system, ACRU2000 (Agricultural Catchments Research Unit 2000), was created to enable users to simulate the hydrological and environmental effects of various land uses in the Republic of South Africa. The ACRU2000 modeling system was entirely re-designed and re-coded from the concepts used in the previously developed ACRU agro-hydrological model. The model was designed in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) and implemented in the Java programming language. The ACRU2000 model was designed to process distributed catchments in a parallel manner during each simulation time step to facilitate the modeling of artificial water flows, particularly with regard to the implementation of the South African National Water Act of 1998. The object-oriented design methodology used to restructure the ACRU model produced a more flexible and extensible model structure, which will facilitate future model expansion. The ACRU2000 modeling system was then tested in the Mgeni River watershed, a medium-sized (4387 km(2)) watershed in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa. The ACRU2000 model was parameterized for 137 sub-catchments to simulate daily streamflows. Monthly totals of simulated flows were compared with observed data from several management catchments for a 15-year period (1979-1993). The model gave satisfactory results in simulating upstream management catchments with the variable high and low flows that are endemic to southern African hydrology. The model had less success in areas encompassing large reservoir and transfer schemes combined with urban and peri-urban areas. Coefficient of determination, model efficiency, and root mean squared error of monthly totals of daily streamflow ranged from 0.43 to 0.85, -4.17 to 0.81, and 4% to 51% of median observed streamflow for individual management catchments, respectively. Further study is necessary to determine whether the differences between model and observed results were caused by model inadequacies, poor estimates of crucial input parameters, or faulty/missing flow data.

AB Radial basis function (RBF) networks are traditionally defined for sets of vector-based observations. In this brief, we reformulate such networks so that they can be applied to adjacency-matrix representations of weighted, directed graphs that represent the relationships between object pairs. We restate the sum-of-squares objective function so that it is purely dependent on entries from the adjacency matrix. From this objective function, we derive a gradient descent update for the network weights. We also derive a gradient update that simulates the repositioning of the radial basis prototypes and changes in the radial basis prototype parameters. An important property of our radial basis function networks is that they are guaranteed to yield the same responses as conventional radial basis networks trained on a corresponding vector realization of the relationships encoded by the adjacency matrix. Such a vector realization only needs to provably exist for this property to hold, which occurs whenever the relationships correspond to distances from some arbitrary metric applied to a latent set of vectors. We, therefore, completely avoid needing to actually construct vectorial realizations via multidimensional scaling, which ensures that the underlying relationships are totally preserved.

TI Energy Efficient Federated Learning Over Heterogeneous Mobile Devices

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING

DE Federated learning over mobile devices; weight quantization; device
   heterogeneity
AB Federated learning (FL) is a popular collaborative distributed machine learning paradigm across mobile devices. However, practical FL over resource constrained mobile devices confronts multiple challenges, e.g., the local on-device training and model updates in FL are power hungry and radio resource intensive for mobile devices. To address these challenges, in this paper, we attempt to take FL into the design of future wireless networks and develop a novel joint design of wireless transmission and weight quantization for energy efficient FL over mobile devices. Specifically, we develop flexible weight quantization schemes to facilitate on-device local training over heterogeneous mobile devices. Based on the observation that the energy consumption of local computing is comparable to that of model updates, we formulate the energy efficient FL problem into a mixed-integer programming problem where the quantization and spectrum resource allocation strategies are jointly determined for heterogeneous mobile devices to minimize the overall FL energy consumption (computation + transmissions) while guaranteeing model performance and training latency. Since the optimization variables of the problem are strongly coupled, an efficient iterative algorithm is proposed, where the bandwidth allocation and weight quantization levels are derived. Extensive simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

AB Microbiome samples harvested from urban environments can be informative in predicting the geographic location of unknown samples. The idea that different cities may have geographically disparate microbial signatures can be utilized to predict the geographical location based on city-specific microbiome samples. We implemented this idea first; by utilizing standard bioinformatics procedures to pre-process the raw metagenomics samples provided by the CAMDA organizers. We trained several component classifiers and a robust ensemble classifier with data generated from taxonomy-dependent and taxonomy-free approaches. Also, we implemented class weighting and an optimal oversampling technique to overcome the class imbalance in the primary data. In each instance, we observed that the component classifiers performed differently, whereas the ensemble classifier consistently yielded optimal performance. Finally, we predicted the source cities of mystery samples provided by the organizers. Our results highlight the unreliability of restricting the classification of metagenomic samples to source origins to a single classification algorithm. By combining several component classifiers via the ensemble approach, we obtained classification results that were as good as the best-performing component classifier.

AB Semantic feature production norms have several desirable characteristics that have supported models of representation and processing in adults. However, several key challenges have limited the use of semantic feature norms in studies of early language acquisition. First, existing norms provide uneven and inconsistent coverage of early-acquired concepts that are typically produced and assessed in children under the age of three, which is a time of tremendous growth of early vocabulary skills. Second, it is difficult to assess the degree to which young children may be familiar with normed features derived from these adult-generated datasets. Third, it has been difficult to adopt standard methods to generate semantic network models of early noun learning. Here, we introduce Feats-a tool that was designed to make headway on these challenges by providing a database, the Language Learning and Meaning Acquisition (LLaMA) lab Noun Norms that extends a widely used set of feature norms McRae et al. Behavior Research Methods37, 547-559, (2005) to include full coverage of noun concepts on a commonly used early vocabulary assessment. Feats includes several tools to facilitate exploration of features comprising early-acquired nouns, assess the developmental appropriateness of individual features using toddler-accessibility norms, and extract semantic network statistics for individual vocabulary profiles. We provide a tutorial overview of Feats. We additionally validate our approach by presenting an analysis of an overlapping set of concepts collected across prior and new data collection methods. Furthermore, using network graph analyses, we show that the extended set of norms provides novel, reliable results given their enhanced coverage.

AB Many vegetables and fruit are sensitive to storage at lower temperatures and experience chilling injury that can result in internal disorder, leading to postharvest waste and economic loss. Most tropical and subtropical fruit, such as avocado and mango, are sensitive to cold storage and can develop chilling injury with symptoms such as abnormal ripening, skin pitting, and darkening of the mesocarp. The severity of chilling injury symptoms is determined by various factors, including the cultivar, the storage temperature, and the length of cold exposure. The object of this study was to develop a method for estimation of internal chilling injury in avocado using hyperspectral imaging (HSI). Hyperspectral images of the avocado surface were obtained with a hyperspectral camera over the wavelength range of 400 nm to 1000 nm with 2 nm resolution. Using estimated functions of multiple instances (eFUMI) and hyperspectral unmixing approaches, we identified the spectra that correlated with areas of internal injured. By quantifying injured areas and fruit firmness, we showed the association between the internal and the external changes as detected by HSI, which implied that HSI has the potential to be used to monitor internal disorder of avocado. HSI technology opens the possibility of non-destructive determination of chilling injury and other internal quality attributes in horticultural and food products.

AB Objective. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are the benchmark for accurate radiotherapy dose calculations, notably in patient-specific high dose rate brachytherapy (HDR BT), in cases where considering tissue heterogeneities is critical. However, the lengthy computational time limits the practical application of MC simulations. Prior research used deep learning (DL) for dose prediction as an alternative to MC simulations. While accurate dose predictions akin to MC were attained, graphics processing unit limitations constrained these predictions to large voxels of 3 mm x 3 mm x 3 mm. This study aimed to enable dose predictions as accurate as MC simulations in 1 mm x 1 mm x 1 mm voxels within a clinically acceptable timeframe. Approach. Computed tomography scans of 98 breast cancer patients treated with Iridium-192-based HDR BT were used: 70 for training, 14 for validation, and 14 for testing. A new cropping strategy based on the distance to the seed was devised to reduce the volume size, enabling efficient training of 3D DL models using 1 mm x 1 mm x 1 mm dose grids. Additionally, novel DL architecture with layer-level fusion were proposed to predict MC simulated dose to medium-in-medium (D m,m ). These architectures fuse information from TG-43 dose to water-in-water (D w,w ) with patient tissue composition at the layer-level. Different inputs describing patient body composition were investigated. Main results. The proposed approach demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, on par with the MC D m,m maps, but 300 times faster. The mean absolute percent error for dosimetric indices between the MC and DL-predicted complete treatment plans was 0.17% +/- 0.15% for the planning target volume V 100, 0.30% +/- 0.32% for the skin D 2cc , 0.82% +/- 0.79% for the lung D 2cc , 0.34% +/- 0.29% for the chest wall D 2cc and 1.08% +/- 0.98% for the heart D 2cc . Significance. Unlike the time-consuming MC simulations, the proposed novel strategy efficiently converts TG-43 D w,w maps into precise D m,m maps at high resolution, enabling clinical integration.

ID KERNEL
AB Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) may bring huge health risks and dangerous effects to a patient's body when taking two or more drugs at the same time or within a certain period of time. Therefore, the automatic extraction of unknown DDIs has great potential for the development of pharmaceutical agents and the safety of drug use. In this article, we propose a novel recurrent hybrid convolutional neural network (RHCNN) for DDI extraction from biomedical literature. In the embedding layer, the texts mentioning two entities are represented as a sequence of semantic embeddings and position embeddings. In particular, the complete semantic embedding is obtained by the information fusion between a word embedding and its contextual information which is learnt by recurrent structure. After that, the hybrid convolutional neural network is employed to learn the sentence-level features which consist of the local context features from consecutive words and the dependency features between separated words for DDI extraction. Lastly but most significantly, in order to make up for the defects of the traditional cross-entropy loss function when dealing with class imbalanced data, we apply an improved focal loss function to mitigate against this problem when using the DDIExtraction 2013 dataset. In our experiments, we achieve DDI automatic extraction with a micro F-score of 75.48% on the DDIExtraction 2013 dataset, outperforming the state-of-the-art approach by 2.49%.

TI Emerging trends in managed care pharmacy: A mixed-method study
SO JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE & SPECIALTY PHARMACY
LA English
DT Article
ID COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE; EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB BACKGROUND: Over the past 5 years, managed care pharmacy has been shaped by a global pandemic, advancements in generative artificial intelligence (AI), Medicare drug price negotiation policies, and significant therapeutic developments. Collective intelligence methods can be used to anticipate future developments in practice to help organizations plan and develop new strategies around those changes. OBJECTIVE: To identify emerging trends in managed care pharmacy. METHODS: In this sequential mixed-method study, we invited experts to participate in a multidisciplinary advisory panel to develop a survey with 5 overarching domains. The qualitative analysis for our advisory panel meetings used a thematic analysis approach. To analyze the cross-sectional survey results, we used descriptive statistics and exploratory bivariate statistics to test for possible relationships with survey respondent demographics and likelihood predictions. To assess respondent opinions on the overall likelihood of an event occurring in the next 5 years, we combined "Highly likely/Somewhat likely" responses and compared with "Highly unlikely/Somewhat unlikely" responses. RESULTS: Following our advisory panel focus groups, a total of 53 scenarios were developed for inclusion in the quantitative survey under the domains of (1) information technology, (2) therapeutics and diagnostics, (3) payment models, (4) pharmacy operations, and (5) public policy. A total of 1,238 individuals were invited to participate in the survey. Of eligible participants, 201 complete survey responses were received for a final response rate of 16.2%. Survey participants rated increased use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists by at least 25%, at least 1 major data breach, more than 10 new orphan drug approvals, and AI use in more than half of prior authorization reviews as the most likely scenarios to occur in the next 5 years. Respondents identified the following broad issues as those most likely to impact their organizations (employers) in the next 5 years: federal and state policy changes impacting managed care, cell and gene therapies, impact of AI on managed care operations, and emerging payment models. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides valuable insights into the emerging trends that are expected to shape managed care pharmacy over the next 5 years. The integration of advanced technologies, such as AI, along with the increasing focus on specialty therapeutics, represents both opportunities and challenges for managed care organizations. However, areas with lower consensus highlight the need for caution in strategic planning.

AB With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, traditional disease diagnoses carried out in medical institutions can now be performed remotely at home or even ambient environments, yielding the concept of the Internet of Health Things (IoHT). Among the diverse IoHT applications, inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based systems play a significant role in the detection of diseases in many fields, such as neurological, musculoskeletal, and mental. However, traditional numerical interpretation methods have proven to be challenging to provide satisfying detection accuracies owing to the low quality of raw data, especially under strong electromagnetic interference (EMI). To address this issue, in recent years, machine learning (ML)-based techniques have been proposed to smartly map IMU-captured data on disease detection and progress. After a decade of development, the combination of IMUs and ML algorithms for assistive disease diagnosis has become a hot topic, with an increasing number of studies reported yearly. A systematic search was conducted in four databases covering the aforementioned topic for articles published in the past six years. Eighty-one articles were included and discussed concerning two aspects: different ML techniques and application scenarios. This review yielded the conclusion that, with the help of ML technology, IMUs can serve as a crucial element in disease diagnosis, severity assessment, characteristic estimation, and monitoring during the rehabilitation process. Furthermore, it summarizes the state-of-the-art, analyzes challenges, and provides foreseeable future trends for developing IMU-ML systems for IoHT.

AB The flocculation of cohesive sediment in the presence of waves is investigated using high-resolution field observations and a newly-developed flocculation model based on artificial neural networks. Vertical profiles of suspended sediment concentration and turbulent intensity are estimated using measurements of current profile and acoustic backscatter. The vertical distribution of floc size is estimated using an artificial neural network (ANN) that is trained and validated using floc size measurements at one vertical level. Data analysis suggests a linear correlation between suspended sediment concentration and turbulence intensity. Observations and numerical simulations show that floc size is inversely related to sediment concentration, turbulence intensity and water temperature. The numerical results indicate that floc growth is supported by low concentration and low turbulence. In the vertical direction, mean size of flocs decreases toward the bottom, suggesting floc breakage due to increasing turbulence intensity toward the bed. A significant decrease in turbulent shear could occur within the bottom few-cm, related to increased damping of turbulence by sediment induced density stratification. The results of the numerical simulations presented here are consistent with the concept of a cohesive sediment particle undergoing aggregation-fragmentation processes, and suggest that the ANN can be a precise tool to study flocculation processes.

AB We reconstructed soil moisture dynamics from sensor records, taught reconstructed dynamics to echo state neural networks (ESNN), and employed skillful ESNN architectures as digital twins to forecast real-world soil moisture levels out-of-sample. Recent proof-of-concept demonstrates that ESNN can learn complex nonlinear dynamics from clean data generated by closed 'toy' models with known state-space dynamics. However, in modeling open real-world biophysical systems like the soil, we do not directly observe state space dynamics, and consequently must infer them from noisy data. We addressed these challenges by preprocessing data inputted into ESNN with methods from empirical nonlinear dynamics to filter noise, test for stationarity, and reconstruct state-space dynamics from denoised data. This promotes the dynamic efficiency of ESNN since it learns complex dynamics of stationary real-world dynamic systems from denoised data. We worked with two sensor records representing different irrigation practices collected in field trials in southern Florida. We reconstructed lowdimensional nonlinear-deterministic dynamics in both records providing empirical evidence that irregular sawtooth cycling due to complex wetting/drying events is not aberrational but intrinsic to the real-world soil moisture systems generating these records. We employed the UF-NVIDIA-GPU infrastructure to uniformly sample a large grid of ESNN hyper-parameters, and successfully screened for architectures skillfully reproducing state space dynamics reconstructed from sensor records. Skillful architectures served as digital twins to forecast soil moisture levels preserving lower- and higher frequency oscillations characterizing both sensor records, and to differentiate between recurring and sporadic extreme soil moisture events. This distinction fine-tunes irrigation planning by forecasting recurrent extreme events to the day. Operationalizing ESNN for real biophysical data has broader impacts in addressing pressing environmental challenges involving nonlinear biophysical processes and creating AI-based early-warning systems forecasting extreme environmental events (flooding, drought, landslides, fires).

AB Hurricanes are one of the most frequent and destructive disasters in the United States. The events are large scale and have relatively long-term impacts. Social networking platforms such as Twitter can provide real-time information for disaster managers and affected populations during large-scale disasters (e.g., hurricanes), but extracting useful information and interpreting data accurately for disaster management is still challenging. Sentiment analysis of social media data helps detect the concerns of affected people and understand individuals' responses on the ground at unprecedented scales, but the method is known to be domain-dependent. The same words or expressions can indicate opposite sentiments in different domains. This paper proposes a domain-specific sentiment analysis approach specifically for tweets posted during hurricanes (DSSA-H). DSSA-H can retrieve hurricane-relevant tweets with a trained supervised-learning classifier, Random Forest (RF), and classify the sentiment of hurricane-relevant tweets based on a domain-adversarial neural network (DANN). We built a dataset of tweets posted during six recent hurricanes and applied the DSSA-H approach for sentiment analysis. After evaluation, we found that each classifier (i.e., RF and DANN) outperforms baseline classifiers and that DSSA-H outperforms two high-performing general sentiment classification approaches when classifying sentiments of tweets posted during hurricanes. We also applied DSSA-H in examining sentiment patterns across six recent hurricanes in the U.S. This domain-specific sentiment analysis approach can be used by the first responders and affected communities to more accurately and rapidly detect crises and emergent events, allocate resources, and assess disaster's impact during hurricanes. DSSA-H contributes to an intelligent and adaptive disaster information system for the data-rich human and the built environment system.

AB Populations used to create warfarin dose prediction algorithms largely lacked participants reporting Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. While previous research suggests nonlinear modeling improves warfarin dose prediction, this research has mainly focused on populations with primarily European ancestry. We compare the accuracy of stable warfarin dose prediction using linear and nonlinear machine learning models in a large cohort enriched for US Latinos and Latin Americans (ULLA). Each model was tested using the same variables as published by the International Warfarin Pharmacogenetics Consortium (IWPC) and using an expanded set of variables including ethnicity and warfarin indication. We utilized a multiple linear regression model and three nonlinear regression models: Bayesian Additive Regression Trees, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines, and Support Vector Regression. We compared each model's ability to predict stable warfarin dose within 20% of actual stable dose, confirming trained models in a 30% testing dataset with 100 rounds of resampling. In all patients (n = 7,030), inclusion of additional predictor variables led to a small but significant improvement in prediction of dose relative to the IWPC algorithm (47.8 versus 46.7% in IWPC, p = 1.43 x 10(-15)). Nonlinear models using IWPC variables did not significantly improve prediction of dose over the linear IWPC algorithm. In ULLA patients alone (n = 1,734), IWPC performed similarly to all other linear and nonlinear pharmacogenetic algorithms. Our results reinforce the validity of IWPC in a large, ethnically diverse population and suggest that additional variables that capture warfarin dose variability may improve warfarin dose prediction algorithms.</p>

AB A common conceptualization of Parkinson's disease is that alpha-syn aggregation leads to cell death, followed by symptomology. Here, Kulkarni et al. propose a novel 'synapse to network prodrome cascade' wherein in the absence of overt cell death, pathological alpha-syn induces synaptic loss and aberrant network activity, underlying prodromal non-motor symptoms.
   The prodromal phase of Parkinson's disease is characterized by aggregation of the misfolded pathogenic protein alpha-synuclein in select neural centres, co-occurring with non-motor symptoms including sensory and cognitive loss, and emotional disturbances. It is unclear whether neuronal loss is significant during the prodrome. Underlying these symptoms are synaptic impairments and aberrant neural network activity. However, the relationships between synaptic defects and network-level perturbations are not established. In experimental models, pathological alpha-synuclein not only impacts neurotransmission at the synaptic level, but also leads to changes in brain network-level oscillatory dynamics-both of which likely contribute to non-motor deficits observed in Parkinson's disease. Here we draw upon research from both human subjects and experimental models to propose a 'synapse to network prodrome cascade' wherein before overt cell death, pathological alpha-synuclein induces synaptic loss and contributes to aberrant network activity, which then gives rise to prodromal symptomology. As the disease progresses, abnormal patterns of neural activity ultimately lead to neuronal loss and clinical progression of disease. Finally, we outline goals and research needed to unravel the basis of functional impairments in Parkinson's disease and other alpha-synucleinopathies.

AB Background: There is a limited amount of data on the safety profile of the COVID-19 vector vaccine Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik V). Previous infodemiology studies showed that social media discourse could be analyzed to assess the most concerning adverse events (AE) caused by drugs.
   Objective: We aimed to investigate mild AEs of Sputnik V based on a participatory trial conducted on Telegram in the Russian language. We compared AEs extracted from Telegram with other limited databases on Sputnik V and other COVID-19 vaccines. We explored symptom co-occurrence patterns and determined how counts of administered doses, age, gender, and sequence of shots could confound the reporting of AEs.
   Methods: We collected a unique dataset consisting of 11,515 self-reported Sputnik V vaccine AEs posted on the Telegram group, and we utilized natural language processing methods to extract AEs. Specifically, we performed multilabel classifications using the deep neural language model Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) "DeepPavlov," which was pretrained on a Russian language corpus and applied to the Telegram messages. The resulting area under the curve score was 0.991. We chose symptom classes that represented the following AEs: fever, pain, chills, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, headache, insomnia, lymph node enlargement, erythema, pruritus, swelling, and diarrhea.
   Results: Telegram users complained mostly about pain (5461/11,515, 47.43%), fever (5363/11,515, 46.57%), fatigue (3862/11,515, 33.54%), and headache (2855/11,515, 24.79%). Women reported more AEs than men (1.2-fold, P<.001). In addition, there were more AEs from the first dose than from the second dose (1.1-fold, P<.001), and the number of AEs decreased with age (beta=.05 per year, P<.001). The results also showed that Sputnik V AEs were more similar to other vector vaccines (132 units) than with messenger RNA vaccines (241 units) according to the average Euclidean distance between the vectors of AE frequencies. Elderly Telegram users reported significantly more (5.6-fold on average) systemic AEs than their peers, according to the results of the phase 3 clinical trials published in The Lancet. However, the AEs reported in Telegram posts were consistent (Pearson correlation r=0.94, P=.02) with those reported in the Argentinian postmarketing AE registry.
   Conclusions: After the Sputnik V vaccination, Russian Telegram users reported mostly pain, fever, and fatigue. The Sputnik V AE profile was comparable with other vector COVID-19 vaccines. Discussion on social media could provide meaningful information about the AE profile of novel vaccines.

AB A major obstacle for machine learning (ML) in chemical science is the lack of physically informed feature representations that provide both accurate prediction and easy interpretability of the ML model. In this work, we describe adsorption systems using novel two-dimensional energy histogram (2D-EH) features, which are obtained from the probe-adsorbent energies and energy gradients at grid points located throughout the adsorbent. The 2D-EH features encode both energetic and structural information of the material and lead to highly accurate ML models (coefficient of determination R2 similar to 0.94-0.99) for predicting single-component adsorption capacity in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). We consider the adsorption of spherical molecules (Kr and Xe), linear alkanes with a wide range of aspect ratios (ethane, propane, n-butane, and n -hexane), and a branched alkane (2,2-dimethylbutane) over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. The interpretable 2D-EH features enable the ML model to learn the basic physics of adsorption in pores from the training data. We show that these MOF-data-trained ML models are transferrable to different families of amorphous nanoporous materials. We also identify several adsorption systems where capillary condensation occurs, and ML predictions are more challenging. Nevertheless, our 2D-EH features still outperform structural features including those derived from persistent homology. The novel 2D-EH features may help accelerate the discovery and design of advanced nanoporous materials using ML for gas storage and separation in the future.

AB A dynamic neural network (DNN) based robust observer for uncertain nonlinear systems is developed. The observer structure consists of a DNN to estimate the system dynamics on-line, a dynamic filter to estimate the unmeasurable state and a sliding mode feedback term to account for modeling errors and exogenous disturbances. The observed states are proven to asymptotically converge to the system states of high-order uncertain nonlinear systems through Lyapunov-based analysis. Simulations and experiments on a two-link robot manipulator are performed to show the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison to several other state estimation methods.

AB Colorful displays have evolved in multiple plant and animal species as signals to mutualists, antagonists, competitors, mates, and other potential receivers. Studies of color have long relied on subjective classifications of color by human observers. However, humans have a limited ability to perceive color compared to other animals, and human biological, cultural, and environmental variables can influence color perception. Here, we test the consistency of human color classification using fruit color as a model system. We used reflectance data of 67 tropical fruits and surveyed 786 participants to assess the degree to which (a) participants of different cultural and linguistic backgrounds agree on color classification of fruits; and (b) human classification to a discrete set of commonly used colors (e.g., red, blue, green) corresponds to natural clusters based on light reflectance measures processed through visual systems of other animals. We find that individual humans tend to agree on the colors they attribute to fruits across language groups. However, these colors do not correspond to clearly discernible clusters in di- or tetrachromatic visual systems. These results indicate that subjective color categorizations tend to be consistent among observers and can be used for large synthetic studies, but also that they do not fully reflect natural categories that are relevant to animal observers.

AB Meta-analytic and experimental studies investigating the neural basis of emotion often compare functional activation in different emotional induction contexts, assessing evidence for a "core affect" or "salience" network. Meta-analyses necessarily aggregate effects across diverse paradigms and different samples, which ignore potential neural differences specific to the method of affect induction. Data from repeated measures designs are few, reporting contradictory results with a small N. In the current study, functional brain activity is assessed in a large (N = 61) group of healthy participants during two common emotion inductions-scene perception and narrative imagery-to evaluate cross-paradigm consistency. Results indicate that limbic and paralimbic regions, together with visual and parietal cortex, are reliably engaged during emotional scene perception. For emotional imagery, in contrast, enhanced functional activity is found in several cerebellar regions, hippocampus, caudate, and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, consistent with the conception that imagery is an action disposition. Taken together, the data suggest that a common emotion network is not engaged across paradigms, but that the specific neural regions activated during emotional processing can vary significantly with the context of the emotional induction.

ID NEURAL-NETWORKS; SYSTEMS; MODEL
AB Artificial neural networks have been shown to perform well in automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks, although their complexity and excessive computational costs have limited their use. Recently, a recurrent neural network with simplified training, the echo state network (ESN), was introduced by Jaeger and shown to outperform conventional methods in time series prediction experiments. We created the predictive ESN classifier by combining the ESN with a state machine framework. In small-vocabulary ASR experiments, we compared the noise-robust performance of the predictive ESN classifier with a hidden Markov model (HMM) as a function of model size and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The predictive ESN classifier outperformed an HMM by 8-dB SNR, and both models achieved maximum noise-robust accuracy for architectures with more states and fewer kernels per state. Using ten trials of random sets of training/validation/test speakers, accuracy for the predictive ESN classifier, averaged between 0 and 20 dB SNR, was 81 +/- 3%, compared to 61 +/- 2% for an HMM. The closed-form regression training for the ESN significantly reduced the computational cost of the network, and the reservoir of the ESN created a high-dimensional representation of the input with memory which led to increased noise-robust classification.

AB In this paper, an indirect herding problem is considered for a single herder that is outnumbered by multiple target agents. Indirect herding is a problem that involves a network of one or more controllable herding agents and indirectly controlled target agents (i.e., the target agents can only be controlled through the herder by exploiting herder-target interactions), where the goal is to achieve a network-wide objective. This paper investigates the unique problem where a single herder is required to regulate all the target agents to some desired formation. The problem is further complicated by the fact that the target agents have uncertain nonlinear dynamics, including uncertainties in the herder-target interaction. Neural network function approximation methods are used along with switched systems methods to ensure uniformly ultimately bounded convergence of the agent trajectories provided the developed sufficient dwell-time conditions are satisfied. Simulation and experimental results that involve one herding agent and multiple target agents demonstrate the validity of the designed controller and function approximation scheme for multiple herding objectives.

AB This paper describes an integrated strategy to innovate teaching in the undergraduate classroom by appropriately utilizing information technologies. The innovation is an interactive learning environment built around an interactive electronic book (i-book). The i-book is a tight integration of a hypertext document with a simulator. The hypertext specifies the presentation order of the theoretical topics, and the simulator is an essential piece of learning. The lecture exploit the i-book, transforming the classroom into an interactive teaching laboratory. An electronic white board is used in every lecture to teach from the text and run the simulations. Our goal is to teach adaptive systems to undergraduate electrical engineering students. Undergraduates do not have the mathematical background to comprehend the equation-based approach utilized in graduate-level adaptive systems courses. We have used the i-book for undergraduate instruction with very positive results. We are now ready to extend the format for distance learning. This new teaching methodology transcends adaptive systems and can be applied to other engineering and science courses which have access to simulators.

AB Azeotropic mixtures, an important class of technological fluids, constitute a challenge to theoretical modeling of their properties. The number of possible intermolecular interactions in multicomponent systems grows combinatorially as the number of components increases. Ab initio methods are barely applicable, because rather large clusters would need to be calculated, which is prohibitively time-consuming. The quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPR) method, which is efficient and extremely fast, could be a viable alternative approach, but the QSPR methodology requires adequate modification to provide a consistent treatment of multicomponent mixtures. We now report QSPR models for the prediction of normal boiling point:: of ternary azeotropic mixtures based on a training set of 78 published data points. A limited set of meticulously designed descriptors, together comprising the Universal Solvation Equation (J. Chem. Inf Model. 2009, 49, 634), was used to provide input parameters for multiple regression and neural network models. The multiple regression model thus obtained is good for explanatory purposes, while the neural network model provides a better quality of fit, which is as high as 0.995 in terms of squared correlation coefficient. This model was also properly validated and analyzed in terms of parameter contributions and their nonlinearity characteristics.

ID NEURAL-NETWORKS; SIGNAL
AB This paper investigates the application of error-entropy minimization algorithms to digital communications channel equalization. The pdf of the error between the training sequence and the output of the equalizer is estimated using the Parzen windowing method with a Gaussian kernel, and then, the Renyi's quadratic entropy is minimized using a gradient descent algorithm. By estimating the Renyis entropy over a short sliding window, an online training algorithm is also introduced. Moreover, for a linear equalizer, an orthogonality condition for the minimum entropy solution that leads to an alternative fixed-point iterative minimization method is derived.
   The performance of linear and nonlinear equalizers trained with entropy and mean square error (MSE) is compared. As expected, the results of training a linear equalizer are very similar for both criteria since, even if the input noise is non-Gaussian, the output filtered noise tends to be Gaussian. On the other hand, for nonlinear channels and using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) as the equalizer, differences between both criteria appear. Specifically, it is shown that the additional information used by the entropy criterion yields a faster convergence in comparison with the MSE.

DE Adversarial examples; deep neural network; automatic speech recognition
AB Deep Neural Network (DNN) is gaining popularity thanks to its ability to attain high accuracy and performance in various security-crucial scenarios. However, recent research shows that DNN-based Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Specifically, these attacks mainly focus on formulating a process of adversarial example generation as iterative, optimization-based attacks. Although these attacks make significant progress, they still take large generation time to produce adversarial examples, which makes them difficult to be launched in real-world scenarios. In this article, we propose a real-time attack framework that utilizes the neural network trained by the gradient approximation method to generate adversarial examples on Keyword Spotting (KWS) systems. The experimental results show that these generated adversarial examples can easily fool a black-box KWS system to output incorrect results with only one inference. In comparison to previous works, our attack can achieve a higher success rate with less than 0.004 s. We also extend our work by presenting a novel ensemble audio adversarial attack and testing the attack on KWS systems equipped with existing defense mechanisms. The efficacy of the proposed attack is well supported by promising experimental results.

AB A sufficient condition to solve an optimal control problem is to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. However, finding a value function that satisfies the HJB equation for a nonlinear system is challenging. For an optimal control problem when a cost function is provided a priori, previous efforts have utilized feedback linearization methods which assume exact model knowledge, or have developed neural network (NN) approximations of the HJB value function. The result in this paper uses the implicit learning capabilities of the RISE control structure to learn the dynamics asymptotically. Specifically, a Lyapunov stability analysis is performed to show that the RISE feedback term asymptotically identifies the unknown dynamics, yielding semi-global asymptotic tracking. In addition, it is shown that the system converges to a state space system that has a quadratic performance index which has been optimized by an additional control element. An extension is included to illustrate how a NN can be combined with the previous results. Experimental results are given to demonstrate the proposed controllers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, the problem of phase retrieval is addressed. Its solution is based on the Lagrange programming neural network (LPNN), which is an analog neural computational technique for solving nonlinear constrained optimization problems according to the Lagrange multiplier theory. The local stability of the proposed algorithm is also investigated. Furthermore, we extend the LPNN based approach to more challenging array signal processing applications, namely, when multiple vector signals with full column rank or other constraints are required to be recovered from measured magnitudes. One of the key difficulties for these challenges is pairing the separately estimated parameters, while the parameters estimated by the extended method are automatically paired. The performance of the developed algorithms is demonstrated via computer simulations.

AB Accumulation of databases containing volatile attributes of foods measured by electronic noses requires transportability of data between machines. Due to differences in each machine, or sensor drift, the same sample may result in slightly different readings. Three functions (coefficient, F-1; coefficient with intercept, F-2; matrix, F-3) and two neural network configurations (NN1, NN2) were tried to assess their suitability for acceptable transformation. Two EEV electronic noses with identical sensors were used to read milk samples stored for up to 12 days. Six replicate readings were separated to 'calibration' (four replicates) and 'unknown' (two replicates) sets. Discriminant function analysis was applied to evaluate 'unknowns' in 'calibration' sets. When 'old unknowns' were converted and classified in 'new calibrations', correct classification rates (CCR) were 2/12, 3/12 and 7/12 for F-1, F-2 and F-3, respectively. Also, neural networks were used to either transform one 'calibration' set to another (CCR = 8/12 and 9/12), or to evaluate the 'unknown' sets in the 'calibration' sets (CCR = 7/12). More research is needed in this area. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Streptococcus gordonii (S. gordonii, Sg) is one of the early colonizing, supragingival commensal bacterium normally associated with oral health in human dental plaque. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in the inflammation-mediated pathways and are involved in periodontal disease (PD) pathogenesis. PD is a polymicrobial dysbiotic immune-inflammatory disease initiated by microbes in the gingival sulcus/pockets. The objective of this study is to determine the global miRNA expression kinetics in S. gordonii DL1-infected C57BL/6J mice. All mice were randomly divided into four groups (n = 10 mice/group; 5 males and 5 females). Bacterial infection was performed in mice at 8 weeks and 16 weeks, mice were euthanized, and tissues harvested for analysis. We analyzed differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs in the mandibles of S. gordonii-infected mice. Gingival colonization/infection by S. gordonii and alveolar bone resorption (ABR) was confirmed. All the S. gordonii-infected mice at two specific time points showed bacterial colonization (100%) in the gingival surface, and a significant increase in mandible and maxilla ABR (p < 0.0001). miRNA profiling revealed 191 upregulated miRNAs (miR-375, miR-34b-5p) and 22 downregulated miRNAs (miR-133, miR-1224) in the mandibles of S. gordonii-infected mice at the 8-week mark. Conversely, at 16 weeks post-infection, 10 miRNAs (miR-1902, miR-203) were upregulated and 32 miRNAs (miR-1937c, miR-720) were downregulated. Two miRNAs, miR-210 and miR-423-5p, were commonly upregulated, and miR-2135 and miR-145 were commonly downregulated in both 8- and 16-week-infected mice mandibles. Furthermore, we employed five machine learning (ML) algorithms to assess how the number of miRNA copies correlates with S. gordonii infections in mice. In the ML analyses, miR-22 and miR-30c (8-week), miR-720 and miR-339-5p (16-week), and miR-720, miR-22, and miR-339-5p (combined 8- and 16-week) emerged as the most influential miRNAs.

ID DESIGN
AB A multiple surrogate-based optimization strategy in conjunction with an evolutionary algorithm has been employed to optimize the shape of a simplified hydraulic turbine diffuser utilizing three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes computational fluid dynamics solutions. Specifically, the diffuser performance is optimized by changing five geometric design variables to maximize the average pressure recovery factor for two inlet boundary conditions with different swirl, corresponding to different operating modes of the hydraulic turbine. Polynomial response surfaces and radial basis neural networks are used as surrogates, while a hybrid formulation of the NSGA-IIa evolutionary algorithm and a c-constraint strategy is applied to construct the Pareto front from the two surrogates. The proposed optimization framework drastically reduces the computational load of the problem, compared to solely utilizing an evolutionary algorithm. For the present problem, the radial basis neural networks are more accurate near the Pareto front while the response surface performs better in regions away from it. By using a local resampling updating scheme the fidelity of both surrogates is improved, especially near the Pareto front. The optimal design yields larger wall angles, nonaxisymmetrical shapes, and delay in wall separation, resulting in 14.4% and 8.9% improvement, respectively, for the two inlet boundary conditions.

AB Objectives Evaluate deep learning (DL) to improve the image quality of the PROPELLER (Periodically Rotated Overlapping Parallel Lines with Enhanced Reconstruction technique) for 3 T magnetic resonance imaging of the female pelvis.Methods Three radiologists prospectively and independently compared non-DL and DL PROPELLER sequences from 20 patients with a history of gynecologic malignancy. Sequences with different noise reduction factors (DL 25%, DL 50%, and DL 75%) were blindly reviewed and scored based on artifacts, noise, relative sharpness, and overall image quality. The generalized estimating equation method was used to assess the effect of methods on the Likert scales. Quantitatively, the contrast-to-noise ratio and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the iliac muscle were calculated, and pairwise comparisons were performed based on a linear mixed model. P values were adjusted using the Dunnett method. Interobserver agreement was assessed using the ? statistic. P value was considered statistically significant at less than 0.05.Results Qualitatively, DL 50 and DL 75 were ranked as the best sequences in 86% of cases. Images generated by the DL method were significantly better than non-DL images (P < 0.0001). Iliacus muscle SNR on DL 50 and DL 75 was significantly better than non-DL images (P < 0.0001). There was no difference in contrast-to-noise ratio between the DL and non-DL techniques in the iliac muscle. There was a high percent agreement (97.1%) in terms of DL sequences' superior image quality (97.1%) and sharpness (100%) relative to non-DL images.Conclusion The utilization of DL reconstruction improves the image quality of PROPELLER sequences with improved SNR quantitatively.

AB The purpose of this study was to identify germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that optimally predict radiation-associated contralateral breast cancer (RCBC) and to provide new biological insights into the carcinogenic process. Fifty-two women with contralateral breast cancer and 153 women with unilateral breast cancer were identified within the Women's Environmental Cancer and Radiation Epidemiology (WECARE) Study who were at increased risk of RCBC because they were. 40 years of age at first diagnosis of breast cancer and received a scatter radiation dose > 1 Gy to the contralateral breast. A previously reported algorithm, preconditioned random forest regression, was applied to predict the risk of developing RCBC. The resulting model produced an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.62 (p = 0.04) on hold-out validation data. The biological analysis identified the cyclic AMP-mediated signaling and Ephrin-A as significant biological correlates, which were previously shown to influence cell survival after radiation in an ATM-dependent manner. The key connected genes and proteins that are identified in this analysis were previously identified as relevant to breast cancer, radiation response, or both. In summary, machine learning/bioinformatics methods applied to genome-wide genotyping data have great potential to reveal plausible biological correlates associated with the risk of RCBC.

AB Consumables-from food to pharmaceuticals and supplements-are becoming increasingly vulnerable to various modes of counterfeiting due to the growing complexity of their supply chain. Mislabeling, re-branding, and false advertising are prevalent in this sector. Existing physical authentication techniques fail to adequately verify integrity of these products and protect the end-users. In this paper, we aim at addressing this critical problem through the development of a novel authentication solution. It builds on the chemical analysis properties of a powerful spectroscopy technique, namely, nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) that is quantitative, non-invasive, low-cost, and amenable for miniaturization (to hand-held form factors). The method is sensitive to small variations in the solid-state chemical structure of a sample, which change the NQR signal properties. These attributes can be unique for various manufacturers, enabling their use as manufacturer-specific watermarks. However, NQR spectroscopy only works reliably (i.e., provides good sensitivity) on compounds that contain certain nuclear isotopes. We take advantage of the intrinsic properties of NQR-sensitive isotopes to use them as extrinsic tags in NQR-insensitive products. The NQR spectra of these extrinsic tags act as unique watermarks that can be analyzed using machine learning methods to authenticate any consumable with high confidence. In particular, we use support vector machines to classify the measured spectra and confirm the identity of items under test. We have assessed this approach on a variety of consumables utilizing semi-custom equipment and verified that it results in high (>95%) classification accuracy. In order to prove the unclonability of such extrinsic tags, we have also performed a mathematical analysis that proves the randomness of the extrinsic tag and confirms its robustness to brute-force attacks.

AB Maximum diversification of data is a central theme in building generalized and accurate machine learning (ML) models. In chemistry, ML has been used to develop models for predicting molecular properties, for example quantum mechanics (QM) calculated potential energy surfaces and atomic charge models. The ANI-1x and ANI-1ccx ML-based general-purpose potentials for organic molecules were developed through active learning; an automated data diversification process. Here, we describe the ANI-1x and ANI-1ccx data sets. To demonstrate data diversity, we visualize it with a dimensionality reduction scheme, and contrast against existing data sets. The ANI-1x data set contains multiple QM properties from 5 M density functional theory calculations, while the ANI-1ccx data set contains 500 k data points obtained with an accurate CCSD(T)/CBS extrapolation. Approximately 14 million CPU core-hours were expended to generate this data. Multiple QM calculated properties for the chemical elements C, H, N, and O are provided: energies, atomic forces, multipole moments, atomic charges, etc. We provide this data to the community to aid research and development of ML models for chemistry.

AB Invasive alien species threaten tropical grasslands and native biodiversity across the globe, including in the natural mosaic of native grasslands and forests in the Shola Sky Islands of the Western Ghats. Here, grasslands have been lost to exotic tree invasion (Acacias, Eucalyptus, and Pines) since the 1950s, but differing invasion intensities between these species and intermixing with native species constitutes a major challenge for remotely sensed assessments. In this study, we assess the accuracy of three satellite and airborne remote sensing sensors (Sentinel-1 radar data, Sentinel-2 multispectral data and AVIRIS-NG hyperspectral data) and three machine learning classification algorithms to identify the spatial extent of native habitats and invasive tree species. We used the support vector machine (SVM), classification and regression trees (CART), and random forest (RF) algorithms implemented on the Google Earth Engine platform. Results indicate that AVIRIS-NG data in combination with SVM produced the highest classification accuracy (98.7%). Fused Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 produce 91% accuracy, while Sentinel-2 alone yielded 91% accuracy; but only with higher coverage of ground control points. The hyperspectral data (AVIRIS-NG) was the only sensor that permitted distinguishing recent invasions (young trees) with high precision. We suspect that large areas will have to be mapped and assessed in the coming years by conservation managers, NGOs to plan restoration or to assess the success of restoration activities, for which a choice of sensors may have to be made based on the age of invasion being mapped, and the quantum of ground control data available.

AB The most widely implemented mitigation measure to reduce transfer of surface runoff pesticides and other pollutants to surface water bodies are vegetative filter strips (VFS). The most commonly used dynamic model for quantifying the reduction by VFS of surface runoff, eroded sediment, pesticides and other pollutants is VFSMOD, which simulates re-duction of total inflow (AQ) and of incoming eroded sediment load (AE) mechanistically during the rainfall-runoff event. These variables are subsequently used to calculate the reduction of pesticide load by the VFS (AP). Since errors in AQ and AE propagate into AP, for strongly-sorbing compounds an accurate prediction of AE is crucial for a reliable prediction of AP. The most important incoming sediment characteristic for AE is the median particle diameter (d50). Current d50 estimation methods are simplistic, yielding fixed d50 based on soil properties and ignoring specific event characteristics and dynamics. We derive an improved dynamic d50 parameterization equation for use in regulatory VFS scenarios based on an extensive dataset of 93 d50 values and 17 candidate explanatory variables compiled from heterogeneous data sources and methods. The dataset was analysed first using machine learning techniques (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) as a dimension reduction technique and to identify potential interactions between explanatory variables. Using the knowledge gained, a parsimonious multiple regression equation with 6 predictors was developed and thoroughly tested. Since three of the predictors are event -specific (eroded sediment yield, rainfall intensity and peak runoff rate), predicted d50 vary dynamically across event magnitudes and intensities. Incorporation of the improved d50 parameterization equation in higher-tier pesti-cide assessment tools with VFSMOD provides more realistic quantitative mitigation in regulatory US-EPA and EU FOCUS pesticide risk assessment frameworks. The equation is also readily applicable to other erosion management problems.

AB Background To investigate item-level measurement properties of the Modified Falls Efficacy (MFES) Scale among English- and Spanish-speaking urban-dwelling older adults as a means to evaluate language equivalence of the tool. Methods Secondary analysis of survey data from 170 English (n = 83) and Spanish (n = 87) speaking older adults who reported to the emergency department of a quaternary medical center in New York City between February 2010 and August 2011. The Rasch rating scale model was used to investigate item statistics and ordering of items, item and person reliability, and model performance of the Modified Falls Efficacy Scale. Results The Modified Falls Efficacy Scale, for English- and Spanish-speakers, demonstrated acceptable fit to the Rasch model of a unidimensional measure. While the range of the construct is more limited for the Spanish group, the interval between tasks are much closer, reflecting little to no construct under-representation. Conclusion There is rationale for continued testing of a unidemsional English- and Spanish-MFES among urban community-dwelling older adults. Large-scale international studies linking the unidemsional MFES to patient outcomes will support the validity of this tool for research and practice.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with thermal and multispectral imaging capabilities, which offer high spatial and temporal resolutions, are becoming increasingly valuable for timely crop monitoring and informed decision-making in precision agriculture. However, processing and extracting useful information from UAV images is often complex, time-consuming, and requires specialized software, which limits its broader adoption for practical field implementations. To address these challenges, the Agriculture Sensing and Artificial Intelligence (AgriSenAI), a user-friendly Python-based desktop application, was developed to automate processing and information extraction from UAV-acquired thermal and multispectral imagery. AgriSenAI was developed by integrating advanced image processing with geospatial analysis to streamline field and plot extraction, plant canopy detection, noise removal, and extraction of information at pixel, plot, and field scales. The application was designed and tested using UAV-based thermal and multispectral imagery collected daily for three years from a research field at the University of Florida's Tropical Research and Education Center in Homestead, Florida. The research field consisted of 12 plots of green beans and 12 plots of sweet corn. The processing time and accuracy of AgriSenAI were evaluated. Results showed that AgriSenAI had a very high level of accuracy in extracting pixel values and significantly reduced processing time and costs compared with traditional approaches involving commercial software. The streamlined AgriSenAI workflow produced reliable canopy temperature information and vegetation indices, demonstrating the capacity to handle large-scale datasets and enhance precision agriculture through improved efficiency and accuracy in remote sensing data processing and information extraction, which could potentially be used to inform timely and data-driven crop management decisions.

AB Computational approaches hold great promise for identifying novel treatment targets and creating translational therapeutics for substance use disorders. From circuitries underlying decision-making to computationally derived neural markers of drug-cue reactivity, this review is a summary of the approaches to data presented at our 2023 Society for Neuroscience Mini-Symposium. Here, we highlight data- and hypothesis-driven computational approaches that recently afforded advancements in addiction and learning neuroscience. First, we discuss the value of hypothesis-driven algorithmic modeling approaches, which integrate behavioral, neural, and cognitive outputs to refine hypothesis testing. Then, we review the advantages of data-driven dimensionality reduction and machine learning methods for uncovering novel predictor variables and elucidating relationships in high-dimensional data. Overall, this review highlights recent breakthroughs in cognitive mapping, model-based analysis of behavior/risky decision-making, patterns of drug taking, relapse, and neuromarker discovery, and showcases the benefits of novel modeling techniques, across both preclinical and clinical data.

AB We investigate the event topology of the lvb (b) over bar q (q) over bar decay mode of top-quark-pair production in proton-antiproton collisions at 1.8 TeV. Neural networks and Fisher discriminates are used in conjunction with modified Fox-Wolfram ''shape'' variables to help distinguish the top-quark-pair signal from the W + jets and b (b) over bar + jets background. Instead of requiring at least four jets in the event, we employ a cut on the number of calorimeter cells with a transverse energy greater than some minimum. By combining these cell cuts with the event shape information, we are able to obtain a signal-to-background ratio of around 9 Vbr an ideal detector), without tagging b quarks. B-quark tagging would, of course, further enhance the signal-to-background ratio.

ID ENTROPY MINIMIZATION; ALGORITHM
AB Recently, the information potential (IP) of order, defined as the argument of the log in the alpha-order Renyi entropy, has been successfully used as an information theoretic criterion for supervised adaptive system training. In this paper, we use the survival function (or equivalently the distribution function) of an absolute value transformed random variable to define a new information potential, named the survival information potential (SIP). Compared with the IP, the SIP has some advantages, such as validity in a wide range of distributions, robustness, and the simplicity in computation. The properties of SIP and a simple formula for computing the empirical SIP are given in the paper. Finally, the SIP criterion is applied in adaptive system training, and simulation examples on FIR adaptive filtering, kernel adaptive filtering, and time delay neural networks (TDNNs) training are presented to demonstrate the performance.

AB We present recent advances in the development of nonlinear extensions to the minimum average correlation energy (MACE) filter. The MACE filter and its variations have been applied to the area of automatic target detection and recognition (ATD/R). Nonlinear extensions (Fisher and Principe, 1994) have been presented based on a statistical formulation of the optimization criterion, of which the linear MACE filter is a special case. The method by which nonlinear topologies can be incorporated into the filter design is reviewed. We present recent advances to this nonlinear method as well as new experimental results applying the technique to inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) data. The methods described result in faster convergence times and significantly better classification performance. (C) 1997 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

AB Background: Common barriers to students' persistence in research include experiencing feelings of exclusion and a lack of belonging, difficulties developing a robust researcher identity, perceptions of racial and social stigma directed toward them, and perceived gaps in research skills, which are particularly pronounced among trainees from groups traditionally underrepresented in research. To address these known barriers, summer research programs have been shown to increase the participation and retention of undergraduate students in research. However, previous programs have focused predominantly on technical knowledge and skills, without integrating an academic enrichment curriculum that promotes professional development by improving students' academic and research communication skills. Objective: This retrospective pre-then-post study aimed to evaluate changes in self-reported ratings of research abilities among a cohort of undergraduate students who participated in a summer research program. Methods: The Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) piloted the implementation of a web-based academic enrichment curriculum for the Summer 2023 Research Internship cohort, which was comprised of students from groups underrepresented in biomedical artificial intelligence research. HuBMAP, a 400-member research consortium funded by the Common Fund at the National Institutes of Health, offered a 10-week summer research internship that included an academic enrichment curriculum delivered synchronously via the web to all students across multiple sites. The curriculum is intended to support intern self-efficacy, researcher identity development, and peer-to-peer learning. At the end of the internship, students were invited to participate in a web-based survey in which they were asked to rate their academic and research abilities before the internship and as a result of the internship using a modified Entering Research Learning Assessment instrument. Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test was performed to assess the difference in the mean scores per respondent before and after participating in the internship. Results: A total of 14 of the 22 undergraduate students who participated in the internship responded to the survey. The results of the retrospective pre-then-post survey indicated that there was a significant increase in students' self-rated research abilities, evidenced by a significant improvement in the mean scores of the respondents when comparing reported skills self-assessment before and after the internship (improvement: median 1.09, IQR 0.88-1.65; W=52.5, P<.001). After participating in the HuBMAP web-based academic enrichment curriculum, students' self-reported research abilities, including their confidence, their communication and collaboration skills, their self-efficacy in research, and their abilities to set research career goals, increased. Conclusions: Summer internship programs can incorporate an academic enrichment curriculum with small-group peer learning in addition to a laboratory-based experience to facilitate increased student engagement, self-efficacy, and a sense of belonging in the research community. Future research should investigate the impact of academic enrichment curricula and peer mentoring on the long-term retention of students in biomedical research careers, particularly retention of students underrepresented in biomedical fields.

We hypothesized that clustering analysis of vital signs measured within six hours of hospital admission would reveal distinct patient phenotypes with unique pathophysiological signatures and clinical outcomes. We created a longitudinal electronic health record dataset for 75,762 adult patient admissions to a tertiary care center in 2014-2016 lasting six hours or longer. Physiotypes were derived via unsupervised machine learning in a training cohort of 41,502 patients applying consensus k-means clustering to six vital signs measured within six hours of admission. Reproducibility and correlation with clinical biomarkers and outcomes were assessed in validation cohort of 17,415 patients and testing cohort of 16,845 patients. Training, validation, and testing cohorts had similar age (54-55 years) and sex (55% female), distributions. There were four distinct clusters. Physiotype A had physiologic signals consistent with early vasoplegia, hypothermia, and low-grade inflammation and favorable short-and long-term clinical outcomes despite early, severe illness. Physiotype B exhibited early tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxemia followed by the highest incidence of prolonged respiratory insufficiency, sepsis, acute kidney injury, and short- and long-term mortality. Physiotype C had minimal early physiological derangement and favorable clinical outcomes. Physiotype D had the greatest prevalence of chronic cardiovascular and kidney disease, presented with severely elevated blood pressure, and had good short-term outcomes but suffered increased 3-year mortality. Comparing sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores across physiotypes demonstrated that clustering did not simply recapitulate previously established acuity assessments. In a heterogeneous cohort of hospitalized patients, unsupervised machine learning techniques applied to routine, early vital sign data identified physiotypes with unique disease categories and distinct clinical outcomes. This approach has the potential to augment understanding of pathophysiology by distilling thousands of disease states into a few physiological signatures.

AB Age of acquisition (AoA) is a psycholinguistic construct that refers to the chronological age at which a given word is acquired. Contemporary theories of AoA have focused on lexical acquisition with respect to either the developing phonological or semantic systems. One way of testing the relative dominance of phonological or semantic contributions is through open-source psycholinguistic databases, whereby AoA may be correlated with other variables (e.g., morphology, semantics, phonology). We report two multiple regression analyses conducted on a corpus of English nouns with, respectively, subjective and objective AoA measures as the dependent variables and a combination of 10 predictors, including 2 semantic, 4 phonological, 2 morphological, and 2 lexical. This multivariate combination of predictors accounted for significant proportions of the variance of AoA in both analyses. We argue that this evidence supports hybrid models of language development that integrate multiple levels of processing-from sound to meaning.

AB Species identification and characterization in tropical environments is an emerging field in tropical remote sensing. Significant efforts are currently aimed at the detection of tree species, of levels of forest successional stages, and the extent of liana occurrence at the top of canopies. In this paper we describe our use of high resolution imagery from the Quickbird Satellite to estimate the flowering population of Tabebuia guayacan trees at Barro Colorado Island (BCI), in Panama. The imagery was acquired on 29 April 2002 and 21 March 2004. Spectral Angle Mapping via a One-Class Support Vector machine was used to detect the presence of 422 and 557 flowering tress in the April 2002 and March 2004 imagery. Of these, 273 flowering trees are common to both dates. This study presents a new perspective on the effectiveness of high resolution remote sensing for monitoring a phenological response and its use as a tool for potential conservation and management of natural resources in tropical environments.

DE Energetic materials; shocked condensed phase explosives; reactive
   metamaterials; energy trapping
AB Through the use of carefully designed numerical experiments on an explosive system, that use predictive models for subcomponents and multi-material simulation, we demonstrate enhanced reactivity by energy trapping in regions of the reactive flow that were previously shocked. Particles and inclusions are placed in designed patterns in an explosive matrix. New capabilities in additive manufacture make it possible to consider novel designs, that we refer to as 'reactive metamaterials'. For a fixed amount of energy delivered by a shock impactor, an explosive that normally would not detonate, will detonate when particles are included. Enhanced reactivity correlates precisely with a change in the partition of energy from kinetic to internal, via reflective processes and flow stagnation in high pressure systems. We analyse cases associated with high shock impedance tantalum particles, and void inclusions, individually and placed in a test array. High impedance reflectors trap energy in regions of pre-shocked material. Whereas void shock collapse causes depressurisation of the material along with rapid material flow, and high pressure spot formation related to the jet impact blast. We analyse how these limiting cases of high impedance particle arrays and void arrays partition specific kinetic and internal energy, during the shock impact transient on the system of matrix explosive and embedded particle/voids. Both generate specific flow fields, pressure and temperature cycles in the matrix material over interval times, determined by the particle/void size and placement. Design variations of the configurations presented here can be tested by both experiment and simulation, and can be searched for optimal designs, aided by modern machine learning search methods.

AB Nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) is commonly used to characterize solid materials containing quadrupolar nuclei. For example, NQR is a promising technique for detecting plastic explosives and other forbidden substances as well as for authenticating pharmaceutical products. Spatially-resolved NQR measurements are of particular interest for enabling automated sample positioning, evaluation of sample heterogeneity, and chemometric authentication of objects. This paper proposes a rapid "single-shot" method for spatially-resolved NQR with the potential to benefit such applications. The proposed method takes advantage of the fact that certain NQR relaxation rates are field-dependent: the observed field dependence is used to convert relaxation time distributions measured in a static field gradient (estimated via Laplace inversion of time-domain data) into spatial distributions. The method was validated using Cl-35 and (37)Cl( )NQR of sodium chlorate and other compounds. Effective spatial resolution was also improved by using machine learning (ML) to classify the measured spatial distributions. In particular, experimental results demonstrate accurate ML-based classification of 3D-printed objects containing arbitrary binary distributions of sodium chlorate. Such distributions can thus be used as NQR-based "embedded barcodes" for authenticating high-value objects. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

DE Dependence measure; functional connectivity dynamics
ID PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION
AB This paper quantifies and comparatively validates functional connectivity between neurons by measuring the statistical dependence between their firing rates. Based on statistical analysis of the pairwise functional connectivity, we estimate, exclusively from neural data, the neural assembly functional connectivity given a behavior task, which provides a quantifiable representation of the dynamic nature during the behavioral task. Because of the time scale of behavior (100-1000 ms), a statistical method that yields robust estimators for this small sample size is desirable. In this work, the temporal resolutions of four estimators of functional connectivity are compared on both simulated data and real neural ensemble recordings. The comparison highlights how the properties and assumptions of statistical-based and phase-based metrics affect the interpretation of connectivity. Simulation results show that mean square contingency (MSC) and mutual information (MI) create more robust quantification of functional connectivity under identical conditions than cross correlation (CC) and phase synchronization (PhS) when the sample size is 1 s. The results of the simulated analysis are extended to real neuronal recordings to assess the functional connectivity in monkey's cortex corresponding to three movement states in a food reaching task and construct the assembly graph given a movement state and the activation degree of a state-related assembly over time using the statistical test exclusively from neural data dependencies. The activation degree of a given state-related assembly reaches the peak repeatedly when the specific movement states occur, which also reveals the network of interactions among the neurons are key for the operation of a specific behavior.

AB The heart integrates neuroregulatory messages into specific bands of frequency, such that the overall amplitude spectrum of the cardiac output reflects the variations of the autonomic nervous system. This modulatory mechanism seems to be well adjusted to the unpredictability of the cardiac demand, maintaining a proper cardiac regulation. A longstanding theory holds that biological organisms facing an ever-changing environment are likely to evolve adaptive mechanisms to extract essential features in order to adjust their behavior. The key question, however, has been to understand how the neural circuitry self-organizes these feature detectors to select behaviorally relevant information. Previous studies in computational perception suggest that a neural population enhances information that is important for survival by minimizing the statistical redundancy of the stimuli. Herein we investigate whether the cardiac system makes use of a redundancy reduction strategy to regulate the cardiac rhythm. Based on a network of neural filters optimized to code heartbeat intervals, we learn a population code that maximizes the information across the neural ensemble. The emerging population code displays filter tuning proprieties whose characteristics explain diverse aspects of the autonomic cardiac regulation, such as the compromise between fast and slow cardiac responses. We show that the filters yield responses that are quantitatively similar to observed heart rate responses during direct sympathetic or parasympathetic nerve stimulation. Our findings suggest that the heart decodes autonomic stimuli according to information theory principles analogous to how perceptual cues are encoded by sensory systems.

AB This study develops a data-driven approach for identifying critical transfer zones in the city to facilitate the coordination of transit and emerging on-demand services. First, the methods convert the trajectories into a 3 D grid with an optimal cube size. Built upon that, we zoom in and study the trajectory density of each mode in a cube and present the results by heatmaps. After that, we zoom out and aggregate those cube information fragments through the clustering algorithms to explore two critical patterns: the ridesharing swarm (RS) zones where many ridesharing trips go through, and the "sandwich pattern" zones where a transit trajectory dominant zone is sandwiched by two ridesharing trajectory dominant zones. Our numerical analysis confirms that these RS zones are well correlated to the promising areas/corridors for integrating transit and on-demand services; the "sandwich patterns" help discover first/last mile (FLM) zones. Last, we further develop a two-channel deep learning network to predict the variation of the FLM gaps so that adaptive services can be planned. A case study based on the field data of the second ring region of Chengdu, China confirms the effectiveness and capability of our analysis approach.

AB Reverse auctions in business-to-business (B2B) exchanges provide numerous benefits to participants. Arguably the most notable benefit is that of lowered prices driven by increased competition in such auctions. The competition between sellers in reverse auctions has been analyzed using a game-theoretic framework and equilibria have been established for several scenarios. One finding of note is that, in a setting in which sellers can meet total demand with the highest-bidding seller being able to sell only a fraction of the total capacity, the sellers resort to a mixed-strategy equilibrium. Although price randomization in industrial bidding is an accepted norm, one might argue that in reality managers do not utilize advanced game theory calculations in placing bids. More likely, managers adopt simple learning strategies. In this situation, it remains an open question as to whether the bid prices converge to the theoretical equilibrium over time. To address this question, we model reverse-auction bidding behavior by artificial agents as both two-player and n-player games in a simulation environment. The agents begin the game with a minimal understanding of the environment but over time analyze wins and losses for use in determining future bids. To test for convergence, the agents explore the price space and exploit prices where profits are higher, given varying cost and capacity scenarios. In the two-player case, the agents do indeed converge toward the theoretical equilibrium. The n-player case provides results that reinforce our understanding of the theoretical equilibria. These results are promising enough to further consider the use of artificial learning mechanisms in reverse auctions and other electronic market transactions, especially as more sophisticated mechanisms are developed to tackle real-life complexities. We also develop the analytical results when one agent does not behave strategically while the other agent does and show that our simulations for this environment also result in convergence toward the theoretical equilibrium. Because the nature of the best response in the new setting is very different (pure strategy as opposed to mixed), it indicates the robustness of the devised algorithm. The use of artificial agents can also overcome the limitations in rationality demonstrated by human managers. The results thus have interesting implications for designing artificial agents in automating bid responses for large numbers of bids where human intervention might not always be possible.

TI DeepAMO: a multi-slice, multi-view anthropomorphic model observer for

AB Purpose: We propose a deep learning-based anthropomorphic model observer (DeepAMO) for image quality evaluation of multi-orientation, multi-slice image sets with respect to a clinically realistic 3D defect detection task.
   Approach: The DeepAMO is developed based on a hypothetical model of the decision process of a human reader performing a detection task using a 3D volume. The DeepAMO is comprised of three sequential stages: defect segmentation, defect confirmation (DC), and rating value inference. The input to the DeepAMO is a composite image, typical of that used to view 3D volumes in clinical practice. The output is a rating value designed to reproduce a human observer's defect detection performance. In stages 2 and 3, we propose: (1) a projection-based DC block that confirms defect presence in two 2D orthogonal orientations and (2) a calibration method that "learns" the mapping from the features of stage 2 to the distribution of observer ratings from the human observer rating data (thus modeling inter- or intraobserver variability) using a mixture density network. We implemented and evaluated the DeepAMO in the context of Tc-99m-DMSA SPECT imaging. A human observer study was conducted, with two medical imaging physics graduate students serving as observers. A 5 x 2-fold cross-validation experiment was conducted to test the statistical equivalence in defect detection performance between the DeepAMO and the human observer. We also compared the performance of the DeepAMO to an unoptimized implementation of a scanning linear discriminant observer (SLDO).
   Results: The results show that the DeepAMO's and human observer's performances on unseen images were statistically equivalent with a margin of difference (Delta AUC) of 0.0426 at p < 0.05, using 288 training images. A limited implementation of an SLDO had a substantially higher AUC (0.99) compared to the DeepAMO and human observer.
   Conclusion: The results show that the DeepAMO has the potential to reproduce the absolute performance, and not just the relative ranking of human observers on a clinically realistic defect detection task, and that building conceptual components of the human reading process into deep learning-based models can allow training of these models in settings where limited training images are available.

ID ALGORITHMS
AB CMT-nek is a new scientific application for performing high fidelity predictive simulations of particle-laden, explosively dispersed turbulent flows. CMT-nek is compute-intensive and targeted for deployment on exascale platforms. The moving particles are the primary source of load imbalance when the application is executed on parallel processors. In a demonstration problem, all the particles are initially in a closed container until a detonation occurs and the particles move apart. If all processors get an equal share of the fluid domain, then only some of the processors get sections of the domain that are initially laden with particles, leading to disparate loads on the processors. To eliminate load imbalance in different processors and to speed up the makespan, we present different load-balancing algorithms for CMT-nek on large-scale multicore platforms. The load on a processor is determined using different techniques. The performance of the different load-balancing algorithms is compared, and the associated overheads are analyzed. Evaluations of the application with and without load-balancing are conducted, and these show that with load-balancing, simulation time becomes faster by a factor of up to 9.97. The performance was further improved by a factor of up to 1.42 using machine-learning-based algorithms.

AB Premise Digitization and imaging of herbarium specimens provides essential historical phenotypic and phenological information about plants. However, the full use of these resources requires high-quality human annotations for downstream use. Here we provide guidance on the design and implementation of image annotation projects for botanical research. Methods and Results We used a novel gold-standard data set to test the accuracy of human phenological annotations of herbarium specimen images in two settings: structured, in-person sessions and an online, community-science platform. We examined how different factors influenced annotation accuracy and found that botanical expertise, academic career level, and time spent on annotations had little effect on accuracy. Rather, key factors included traits and taxa being scored, the annotation setting, and the individual scorer. In-person annotations were significantly more accurate than online annotations, but both generated relatively high-quality outputs. Gathering multiple, independent annotations for each image improved overall accuracy. Conclusions Our results provide a best-practices basis for using human effort to annotate images of plants. We show that scalable community science mechanisms can produce high-quality data, but care must be taken to choose tractable taxa and phenophases and to provide informative training material.

SO JOURNAL OF CURRENT ISSUES AND RESEARCH IN ADVERTISING

ID PERCEPTIONS; EXPOSURE
AB Brands are embracing sociopolitical issues in their advertising campaigns, a strategy termed "woke advertising," to tailor to contemporary social movements. To create social impact, brands upload the woke campaigns on social media platforms, such as YouTube, to arouse discussion. However, the conversation among consumers regarding a woke campaign may move from level-headed debate to emotionally fueled fighting. Thus, research is needed to understand why consumers generate hate/toxic speech in the context of woke advertising. Based on previous research, we adopted machine learning algorithms to classify the comments on two woke campaigns into toxic and nontoxic comments, analyzed the topics of each comment type, examined the engagement performance of each comment type, and tracked the growth of each type of comments over time. Empirical findings shed light on two main sources of cognitive dissonance in the context of woke advertising (i.e., the stance of the woke campaign and others' comments on the woke campaign) and indicate that both supporters and opposers of a woke campaign may use hate/toxic speech to attack the source of cognitive dissonance. Moreover, given the source of cognitive dissonance, consumers may or may not leverage their persuasion knowledge to cope with a woke campaign.

AB Distributional approximation is a fundamental problem in machine learning with numerous applications across all fields of science and engineering and beyond. The key challenge in most approximation methods is the need to tackle the intractable normalization constant present in the candidate distributions used to model the data. This intractability is especially common in distributions of manifold-valued random variables such as rotation matrices, orthogonal matrices etc. In this paper, we focus on the distributional approximation problem in Lie groups since they are frequently encountered in many applications including but not limited to, computer vision, robotics, medical imaging and many more. We present a novel Stein's operator on Lie groups leading to a kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD), which is a normalization-free loss function. We present several theoretical results characterizing the properties of this new KSD on Lie groups and its minimizer namely, the minimum KSD estimator (MKSDE). Properties of MKSDE are presented and proved, including strong consistency, CLT and a closed form of the MKSDE for the von Mises-Fisher and in general, the exponential family on SO(N). Finally, we present several experimental results depicting advantages of MKSDE over maximum likelihood estimation.

AB A robust identification-based state derivative estimation method for uncertain nonlinear systems is developed. The identifier architecture consists of a recurrent multilayer dynamic neural network which approximates the system dynamics online, and a continuous robust feedback Robust Integral of the Sign of the Error (RISE) term which accounts for modeling errors and exogenous disturbances. Numerical simulations provide comparisons with existing robust derivative estimation methods including: a high gain observer, a 2-sliding mode robust exact differentiator, and numerical differentiation methods, such as backward difference and central difference.

AB Background: Tools capable of predicting the risk of asthma exacerbations can facilitate asthma management in clinical practice. However, existing tools require additional data from patients beyond electronic medical records.
   Objective: To predict asthma exacerbation in an upcoming year using electronically accessible data conditional on past adherence to asthma medications.
   Methods: This retrospective cohort study included patients with >= 1 hospitalization or >= 2 medical claims for asthma within 2 consecutive years between 2002 and 2015 in Quebec administrative databases. Cohort entry (CE) was defined as the date of the first asthma-related ambulatory visit on or after meeting the operational definition of asthma. Adherence to each controller medication and use of each rescue medication was measured in the year prior to CE. Elastic-net regularized logistic regression was applied.
   Results: Among 98,823 patients, the mean age was 55.9 years and 36.2% were men. The area under the curve for prediction was 0.708. In the model, the use of long-acting anticholinergic or long-acting beta(2)-agonists in the year prior to CE increased the odds of exacerbation by 24% and 21%, respectively. Among patients who received rescue medication, low and high adherence to controller medications increased the odds by 2%-5% compared with patients with medium adherence. Patients with a predicted risk of >= 0.20 were more likely to develop future exacerbation.
   Conclusion: This risk prediction indicated that asthma-related medication use increased the risk of asthma exacerbation. A potential U-shaped relationship between adherence to controller medications and the risk of exacerbation was identified among users of rescue medications.

AB This paper presents two algorithms to aid the supervised learning of feedforward neural networks. Specifically, an initialization and a learning algorithm are presented. The proposed methods are based on the independent optimization of a subnetwork using linear least squares. An advantage of these methods is that the dimensionality of the effective search space for the non-linear algorithm is reduced, and therefore it decreases the number of training epochs which are required to find a good solution. The performance of the proposed methods is illustrated by simulated examples.

AB COVID-19 has changed many aspects of the hospitality and tourism industry, including technology-oriented and contactless solutions. Despite the increasing number of service companies using robots on their premises, most of the previous attempts and practices of adoption have remained unsuccessful. Prior research hints that socioeconomic factors could influence the successful adoption of these emerging technologies. Nevertheless, these studies ignore the role of profile factors and assume a homogenous response to using robots in service operations during the pandemic. Based on the theory of diffusion of innovation and a sample of 525 participants, this study investigates the differences in customers' attitudes, their level of involvement, and optimism for service robots as well as their intentions to use service robots in the five main areas of hotel operations (front desk, concierge, housekeeping, room service, and food and beverage) based on five profile factors (age, gender, income level, education, and purpose of trip). MANOVA tests show significant differences in all variables based on demographic factors; male, younger, more educated, higher income, and leisure travelers show more positive attitudes, higher involvement, optimism, and intention to use service robots across various hotel departments. In particular, mean scores were found to be smaller for the traditionally human-oriented functional areas of the hotel operations. We also clustered the participants based on their level of comfort and optimism about using service robots in hotels. Given the rapid changes in the service industry and the increasing adoption of service robots, this paper adds a much-needed contribution to the ongoing research on service robots in the service industry by investigating the impact of profile factors on guests' behavior towards service robots.

AB Intracortical recordings can be used to voluntarily control external devices via brain-machine interfaces (BMI). Multiple factors, including the foreign body response (FBR), limit the stability of these neural signals over time. Current clinically approved devices consist of multi-electrode arrays with a single electrode site at the tip of each shank, confining the recording interface to a single layer of the cortex. Advancements in manufacturing technology have led to the development of high-density electrodes that can record from multiple layers. However, the long-term stability of neural recordings and the extent of neuronal cell loss around the electrode across different cortical depths have yet to be explored. To answer these questions, we recorded neural signals from rats chronically implanted with a silicon-substrate microelectrode array spanning the layers of the cortex. Our results show the long-term stability of intracortical recordings varies across cortical depth, with electrode sites around L4-L5 having the highest stability. Using machine learning guided segmentation, our novel histological technique, DeepHisto, revealed that the extent of neuronal cell loss varies across cortical layers, with L2/3 and L4 electrodes having the largest area of neuronal cell loss. These findings suggest that interfacing depth plays a major role in the FBR and long-term performance of intracortical neuroprostheses.

AB Background: Assessing the risk of developing clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia, by machine learning survival analysis approaches, among participants registered in Alzheimer's Disease Centers is important for AD dementia management.
   Objective: To construct a prediction model for the onset time of clinical AD dementia using the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center (NACC) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) registered cohorts.
   Methods: A model was constructed using the Random Survival Forest (RSF) approach and internally and externally validated on the NACC cohort and the ADNI cohort. An R package and a Shiny app were provided for accessing the model.
   Results: We built a predictive model having the six predictors: delayed logical memory score (story recall), CDR (R) Dementia Staging Instrument - Sum of Boxes, general orientation in CDR (R), ability to remember dates and ability to pay bills in the Functional Activities Questionnaire, and patient age. The C indices of the model were 90.82% (SE = 0.71%) and 86.51% (SE = 0.75%) in NACC and ADNI respectively. The time-dependent AUC and accuracy at 48 months were 92.48% (SE = 1.12%) and 88.66% (SE = 1.00%) respectively in NACC, and 90.16% (SE = 1.12%) and 85.00% (SE = 1.14%) respectively in ADNI.
   Conclusion: The model showed good prediction performance and the six predictors were easy to obtain, cost-effective, and non-invasive. The model could be used to inform clinicians and patients on the probability of developing clinical AD dementia in 4 years with high accuracy.

AB We conducted a systematic review of studies examining relationships between measures of beverage alcohol tax or price levels and alcohol sales or self-reported drinking. A total of 112 studies of alcohol tax or price effects were found, containing1003 estimates of the tax/price-consumption relationship.
   Studies included analyses of alternative outcome measures, varying subgroups of the population, several statistical models, and using different units of analysis. Multiple estimates were coded from each study, along with numerous study characteristics. Using reported estimates, standard errors, t-ratios, sample sizes and other statistics, we calculated the partial correlation for the relationship between alcohol price or tax and sales or drinking measures for each major model or subgroup reported within each study. Random-effects models were used to combine studies for inverse variance weighted overall estimates of the magnitude and significance of the relationship between alcohol tax/price and drinking.
   Simple means of reported elasticities are -0.46 for beer, -0.69 for wine and -0.80 for spirits. Meta-analytical results document the highly significant relationships (P < 0.001) between alcohol tax or price measures and indices of sales or consumption of alcohol (aggregate-level r = -0.17 for beer, -0.30 for wine, -0.29 for spirits and -0.44 for total alcohol). Price/tax also affects heavy drinking significantly (mean reported elasticity = -0.28, individual-level r = -0.01, P < 0.01), but the magnitude of effect is smaller than effects on overall drinking.
   A large literature establishes that beverage alcohol prices and taxes are related inversely to drinking. Effects are large compared to other prevention policies and programs. Public policies that raise prices of alcohol are an effective means to reduce drinking.

AB Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in American men. The cancer could either be locally confined, or it could spread outside the organ. When locally confined, there are several options for treating and curing this disease. Otherwise, surgery is the only option, and in extreme cases of outside spread, it could very easily recur within a short time even after surgery and subsequent radiation therapy. Hence, it is important to know, based on pre-surgery biopsy results how likely the cancer is organ-confined or not.
   The paper considers a hierarchical Bayesian neural network approach for posterior prediction probabilities of certain features indicative of non-organ confined prostate cancer. In particular, we find such probabilities for margin positivity (MP) and seminal vesicle (SV) positivity jointly. The available training set consists of bivariate binary outcomes indicating the presence or absence of the two. In addition, we have certain covariates such as prostate specific antigen (PSA), gleason score and the indicator for the cancer to be unilateral or bilateral (i.e. spread on one or both sides) in one data set and gene expression microarrays in another data set. We take a hierarchical Bayesian neural network approach to find the posterior prediction probabilities for a test and validation set, and compare these with the actual outcomes for the first data set. In case of the microarray data we use leave one out cross-validation to access the accuracy of our method. We also demonstrate the superiority of our method to the other competing methods through a simulation study. The Bayesian procedure is implemented by an application of the Markov chain Monte Carlo numerical integration technique. For the problem at hand, our Bayesian bivariate neural network procedure is shown to be superior to the classical neural network, Radford Neal's Bayesian neural network as well as bivariate logistic models to predict jointly the MP and SV in a patient in both the data sets as well as in the simulation study.

AB Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide alternative methods for communicating and acting on the world, since messages or commands are conveyed from the brain to an external device without using the normal output pathways of peripheral nerves and muscles. Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients in the most advanced stages, who have lost the ability to communicate verbally, could benefit from a BCI that may allow them to convey basic thoughts (e. g., "yes" and "no") and emotions. There is currently no report of such research, mostly because the cognitive deficits in AD patients pose serious limitations to the use of traditional BCIs, which are normally based on instrumental learning and require users to self-regulate their brain activation. Recent studies suggest that not only self-regulated brain signals, but also involuntary signals, for instance related to emotional states, may provide useful information about the user, opening up the path for so-called "affective BCIs". These interfaces do not necessarily require users to actively perform a cognitive task, and may therefore be used with patients who are cognitively challenged. In the present hypothesis paper, we propose a paradigm shift from instrumental learning to classical conditioning, with the aim of discriminating "yes" and "no" thoughts after associating them to positive and negative emotional stimuli respectively. This would represent a first step in the development of a BCI that could be used by AD patients, lending a new direction not only for communication, but also for rehabilitation and diagnosis.

AB In this work, we demonstrate provable guarantees on the training of a single ReLU gate in hitherto unexplored regimes. We give a simple iterative stochastic algorithm that can train a ReLU gate in the realizable setting in linear time while using significantly milder conditions on the data distribution than previous such results.& nbsp;Leveraging certain additional moment assumptions, we also show a first-of-its-kind approximate recovery of the true label generating parameters under an (online) data-poisoning attack on the true labels, while training a ReLU gate by the same algorithm. Our guarantee is shown to be nearly optimal in the worst case and its accuracy of recovering the true weight degrades gracefully with increasing probability of attack and its magnitude.& nbsp;For both the realizable and the non-realizable cases as outlined above, our analysis allows for minibatching and computes how the convergence time scales with the mini-batch size. We corroborate our theorems with simulation results which also bring to light a striking similarity in trajectories between our algorithm and the popular S.G.D. algorithm - for which similar guarantees as here are still unknown.

AB Coastal dune environments play a critical role in protecting coastal areas from damage associated with flooding and excessive erosion. Therefore, monitoring the morphology of dunes is an important coastal management operation. Traditional ground-based survey methods are time-consuming, and data must be interpolated over large areas, thus limiting the ability to assess small-scale details. High-resolution uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry allows one to rapidly monitor coastal dune elevations at a fine scale and assess the vulnerability of coastal zones. However, photogrammetric methods are unable to map ground elevations beneath vegetation and only provide elevations for bare sand areas. This drawback is significant as vegetated areas play a key role in the development of dune morphology. To provide a complete digital terrain model for a coastal dune environment at Topsail Hill Preserve in Florida's panhandle, we employed a UAV, equipped with a laser scanner and a high-resolution camera. Along with the UAV survey, we conducted a RTK-GNSS ground survey of 526 checkpoints within the survey area to serve as training/testing data for various machine-learning regression models to predict the ground elevation. Our results indicate that a UAV-LIDAR point cloud, coupled with a genetic algorithm provided the most accurate estimate for ground elevation (mean absolute error & PLUSMN; root mean square error, MAE +/- RMSE = 7.64 +/- 9.86 cm).

AB With the explosion of neural network applications and the linked need to perform an enormous amount of mathematical operations, traditional computing systems faced challenges in terms of speed and power consumption. Photonic integrated circuits (PICs), characterized by low latency, low energy consumption, and high bandwidth data processing capabilities, are attracting more and more attention in the advancing neural network research field. However, current photonic solutions require the use of electrical digital-to-analog (DACs) and analog-to-digital (ADCs) converters, which are significantly energy consumption and weaken the inherent advantages of PICs. In this study, we propose and demonstrate a novel approach, a silicon photonics circuit based on residue arithmetic which allows a faster computation of large integer numbers. By employing a specialized routing architecture, the circuit facilitates one-hot data encoding, obviating the need for DACs and ADCs. Experimental evidence substantiates that the power differential between high and low levels exceeds 6 dB in the worst scenario, with an average higher than 10 dB. Furthermore, the introduction of wavelength-division multiplexing can also achieve a 6 dB high/low difference across multiple wavelengths, elucidating the vast potential of PICs for computational applications.

AB Entropy has been widely employed as a measure of variability for problems, such as machine learning and signal processing. In this paper, we provide some new insights into the behaviors of entropy as a measure of multivariate variability. The relationships between multivariate entropy (joint or total marginal) and traditional measures of multivariate variability, such as total dispersion and generalized variance, are investigated. It is shown that for the jointly Gaussian case, the joint entropy (or entropy power) is equivalent to the generalized variance, while total marginal entropy is equivalent to the geometric mean of the marginal variances and total marginal entropy power is equivalent to the total dispersion. The smoothed multivariate entropy (joint or total marginal) and the kernel density estimation (KDE)-based entropy estimator (with finite samples) are also studied, which, under certain conditions, will be approximately equivalent to the total dispersion (or a total dispersion estimator), regardless of the data distribution.

AB Mycotoxins and particularly aflatoxin are a concern for peanut growers, processors, and consumers. Aflatoxins are responsible for approximately 25 % of liver cancer cases worldwide, while also costing millions of dollars in lost revenue on an annual basis. Current detection techniques based on high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) are time, labor and cost intensive. Peanut product can be held multiple days before testing is complete, costing processors additional revenue loss. Over the past few years, The Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) has been investigating the use of plant-based biogenic volatile organic compounds (bVOCs) for monitoring the status of peanut plants. Initially, GTRI utilized these bVOCs to monitor for heat/drought stress in peanut plants. They quickly saw very promising indications of the ability of bVOCs to monitor other parameters in these plants. More recently, the team has started to investigate the of use of bVOCs to monitor aflatoxin development in plants, pods, and kernels pre- and post-harvest. A field trial for detection of aflatoxin using bVOCs was conducted in August -September of 2020 where three test groups were prepared: plants treated with Aspergillus fungus; plants treated with Afla-Guard (biocontrol agent); plants not treated - acting as a control group. Plant-based bVOCs were collected from the plants before treatment, and once a week post treatment using Stir Bar Sorptive Extraction (SBSE) devices or Twisters (R). Each Twister (R) was then analyzed via gas chromatography -mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Pods from tested plants were harvested and sent to GTRI where bVOCs were collected and analyzed using GC/MS. Several statistical analysis and machine learning techniques were applied to all the collected GC/MS data. It was found using only bVOCs, that Random Forest classification performed well for the analysis of the pod and kernel samples with an F1 score of 0.80. On the other hand, Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA) was only able to correctly classify 50 % of plant-based samples solely on bVOCs alone, which may be due to training models developed using original labels assuming no cross contamination at the field level. These results indicate the potential for bVOC screening for aflatoxin as an important way to lower impacts to growers, shellers, and consumers.

AB The literature regarding subcortical vascular dementia associated with periventricular and deep white matter alterations is reviewed. Information pertaining to neuropathological, neuropsychological, and neuroradiological studies is emphasized. Based on this review and prior neuropsychological studies associating subcortical vascular pathology with greater deficits on tests of executive dysfunction and with relatively better performance on tests of delayed recognition memory, we conclude that vascular dementia associated with periventricular and deep white matter alterations can and should be regarded as a subcortical dementing illness. Also, we support schemes suggested by Erkinjuntti et al. (2000) and Cosentino et al. (this issue) that attempt to integrate neuropsychological and neuroradiological data into a diagnostic paradigm that describes, as well as diagnoses, dementing disorders. We discuss questions and issues about vascular dementia that deserve further consideration and study.

AB Amidst the rapid evolution and integration of AI within higher education, there is an urgent need to explore students' perceptions of AI-based learning. Despite the growing scholarly discussion, little attention has been given to whether students' expectations of their instructors influence their views on AI-driven education. To fill this void, this study gathered data from undergraduate students in the U.S. A key finding reveals the crucial role of perceived social presence in AI instructors. Specifically, students with high expectations for instructor nonverbal immediate behaviors demonstrate more positive perceptions of AI-based education when they experience stronger social presence in their AI instructor. These results underscore the importance of social presence and provide initial insights into how student expectations of instructors shape their evaluation of AI-led educational approaches.

AB As members of network systems share more information among agents and with network providers, sensitive data leakage raises privacy concerns. Motivated by such concerns, we introduce a novel mechanism that privatizes vectors belonging to the unit simplex. Such vectors can be found in many applications, such as privatizing a decision-making policy in a Markov decision process. We use differential privacy as the underlying mathematical framework for this work. The introduced mechanism is a probabilistic mapping that maps a vector within the unit simplex to the same domain using a Dirichlet distribution. We find the mechanism well-suited for inputs within the unit simplex because it always returns a privatized output that is also in the unit simplex. Therefore, no further projection back onto the unit simplex is required. We verify and quantify the privacy guarantees of the mechanism for three cases: identity queries, average queries, and general linear queries. We establish a trade-off between the level of privacy and the accuracy of the mechanism output, and we introduce a parameter to balance the trade-off between them. Numerical results illustrate the proposed mechanism.

AB With nearly 4.2 million registered nurses, nursing is the largest work force and the largest operational cost in health care. During 2022, nursing care accounted for more than 50% of operational costs in U.S. Despite the size of the investment in nurses and nursing care, we lack understanding in a range of important areas, including 1) nurses' contributions to patient outcomes; 2) the impact of nursing interventions; 3) cost of nursing care by patient, family, and community outcomes; and 4) nurse staffing needs based on optimal patient, family, and community outcomes. Underpinning these information needs are fundamental nursing and patient care workflows that provide a plethora of potentially useable data for a value-based approach to nursing care.

AB The purpose of this article is to review steatosis and fibrosis of skeletal muscle, focusing on older adults. Although CT, MRI, and ultrasound are commonly used to image skeletal muscle and provide diagnoses for a variety of medical conditions, quantitative assessment of muscle steatosis and fibrosis is uncommon. This review provides radiologists with a broad perspective on muscle steatosis and fibrosis in older adults by considering the public health impact, biologic mechanisms, and evaluation with CT, MRI, and ultrasound. Promising directions in clinical research that entail artificial intelligence algorithms and the imaging assessment of biologic age are also reviewed. The imaging methods presented hold promise for improving the evaluation of common conditions affecting older adults, including sarcopenia, frailty, and cachexia.

AB An approximate online equilibrium solution is developed for an N-player nonzero-sum game subject to continuous-time nonlinear unknown dynamics and an infinite horizon quadratic cost. A novel actor-critic-identifier structure is used, wherein a robust dynamic neural network is used to asymptotically identify the uncertain system with additive disturbances, and a set of critic and actor NNs are used to approximate the value functions and equilibrium policies, respectively. The weight update laws for the actor neural networks (NNs) are generated using a gradient-descent method, and the critic NNs are generated by least square regression, which are both based on the modified Bellman error that is independent of the system dynamics. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis shows that uniformly ultimately bounded tracking is achieved, and a convergence analysis demonstrates that the approximate control policies converge to a neighborhood of the optimal solutions. The actor, critic, and identifier structures are implemented in real time continuously and simultaneously. Simulations on two and three player games illustrate the performance of the developed method.

AB Learned movements can be skillfully performed at different paces. What neural strategies produce this flexibility? Can they be predicted and understood by network modeling? We trained monkeys to perform a cycling task at different speeds, and trained artificial recurrent networks to generate the empirical muscle-activity patterns. Network solutions reflected the principle that smooth well-behaved dynamics require low trajectory tangling. Network solutions had a consistent form, which yielded quantitative and qualitative predictions. To evaluate predictions, we analyzed motor cortex activity recorded during the same task. Responses supported the hypothesis that the dominant neural signals reflect not muscle activity, but network-level strategies for generating muscle activity. Single-neuron responses were better accounted for by network activity than by muscle activity. Similarly, neural population trajectories shared their organization not with muscle trajectories, but with network solutions. Thus, cortical activity could be understood based on the need to generate muscle activity via dynamics that allow smooth, robust control over movement speed.

AB The concave-convex procedure (CCCP) is a way to construct discrete-time iterative dynamical systems that are guaranteed to decrease global optimization and energy functions monotonically. This procedure can be applied to almost any optimization problem, and many existing algorithms can be interpreted in terms of it. In particular, we prove that all expectation-maximization algorithms and classes of Legendre minimization and variational bounding algorithms can be reexpressed in terms of CCCR We show that many existing neural network and mean-field theory algorithms are also examples of CCCR The generalized iterative scaling algorithm and Sinkhorn's algorithm can also be expressed as CCCP by changing variables. CCCP can be used both as a new way to understand, and prove the convergence of, existing optimization algorithms and as a procedure for generating new algorithms.

AB Recent weakly supervised semantic segmentation methods generate pseudolabels to recover the lost position information in weak labels for training the segmentation network. Unfortunately, those pseudolabels often contain mislabeled regions and inaccurate boundaries due to the incomplete recovery of position information. It turns out that the result of semantic segmentation becomes determinate to a certain degree. In this article, we decompose the position information into two components: high-level semantic information and low-level physical information, and develop a componentwise approach to recover each component independently. Specifically, we propose a simple yet effective pseudolabels updating mechanism to iteratively correct mislabeled regions inside objects to precisely refine high-level semantic information. To reconstruct low-level physical information, we utilize a customized superpixel-based random walk mechanism to trim the boundaries. Finally, we design a novel network architecture, namely, a dual-feedback network (DFN), to integrate the two mechanisms into a unified model. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that DFN outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of intersection-over-union (mIoU).

AB Decision makers rely on episodic memory to calculate choice values in everyday life, yet it is unclear how neural mechanisms of valuation differ when value-related information is encoded versus retrieved from episodic memory. The current fMRI study compared neural correlates of value while information was encoded versus retrieved from memory. Scanned tasks were followed by a behavioral episodic memory test for item-attribute associations. Our analyses sought to (i) identify neural correlates of value that were distinct and common across encoding and retrieval, and (ii) determine whether neural mechanisms of valuation and episodic memory interact. The study yielded three primary findings. First, value-related activation in the fronto-striatal reward circuit and posterior parietal cortex was comparable across valuation phases. Second, value-related activation in select fronto-parietal and salience regions was significantly greater at value retrieval than encoding. Third, there was no interaction between neural correlates of valuation and episodic memory. Taken with prior research, the present study indicates that fronto-parietal and salience regions play a key role in retrieval-dependent valuation and context-specific effects likely determine whether neural correlates of value interact with episodic memory.

AB Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) continues to have adverse effects on cognition and the brain in many infected people, despite a reduced incidence of HIV-associated dementia with combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). Working memory is often affected, along with attention, executive control, and cognitive processing speed. Verbal working memory (VWM) requires the interaction of each of the cognitive component processes along with a phonological loop for verbal repetition and rehearsal. HIV-related functional brain response abnormalities during VWM are evident in functional MRI (fMRI), though the neural substrate underlying these neurocognitive deficits is not well understood. The current study addressed this by comparing 24 HIV+ to 27 demographically matched HIV-seronegative (HIV-) adults with respect to fMRI activation on a VWM paradigm (n-back) relative to performance on two standardized tests of executive control, attention and processing speed (Stroop and Trail Making A-B). As expected, the HIV+ group had deficits on these neurocognitive tests compared to HIV- controls, and also differed in neural response on fMRI relative to neuropsychological performance. Reduced activation in VWM task-related brain regions on the 2-back was associated with Stroop interference deficits in HIV+ but not with either Trail Making A or B performance. Activation of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) of the default mode network during rest was associated with Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-2 (HVLT-2) learning in HIV+. These effects were not observed in the HIV - controls. Reduced dynamic range of neural response was also evident in HIV+ adults when activation on the 2-back condition was compared to the extent of activation of the default mode network during periods of rest. Neural dynamic range was associated with both Stroop and HVLT-2 performance. These findings provide evidence that HIV-associated alterations in neural activation induced by VWM demands and during rest differentially predict executive-attention and verbal learning deficits. That the Stroop, but not Trail Making was associated with VWM activation suggests that attentional regulation difficulties in suppressing interference and/or conflict regulation are a component of working memory deficits in HIV+ adults. Alterations in neural dynamic range may be a useful index of the impact of HIV on functional brain response and as a fMRI metric in predicting cognitive outcomes.

AB A previous double-blind, randomized clinical trial of 42 healthy individuals conducted with Lactobacillus johnsonii N6.2 found that the probiotic's mechanistic tryptophan pathway was significantly modified when the data was stratified based on the individuals' lactic acid bacteria (LAB) stool content. These results suggest that confounding factors such as dietary intake which impact stool LAB content may affect the response to the probiotic treatment. Using dietary intake, serum metabolite, and stool LAB colony forming unit (CFU) data from a previous clinical trial, the relationships between diet, metabolic response, and fecal LAB were assessed. The diets of subject groups with high vs. low CFUs of LAB/g of wet stool differed in their intakes of monounsaturated fatty acids, vegetables, proteins, and dairy. Individuals with high LAB consumed greater amounts of cheese, fermented meats, soy, nuts and seeds, alcoholic beverages, and oils whereas individuals with low LAB consumed higher amounts of tomatoes, starchy vegetables, and poultry. Several dietary variables correlated with LAB counts; positive correlations were determined for nuts and seeds, fish high in N-3 fatty acids, soy, and processed meats, and negative correlations to consumption of vegetables including tomatoes. Using machine learning, predictors of LAB count included cheese, nuts and seeds, fish high in N-3 fatty acids, and erucic acid. Erucic acid alone accurately predicted LAB categorization, and was shown to be utilized as a sole fatty acid source by several Lactobacillus species regardless of their mode of fermentation. Several metabolites were significantly upregulated in each group based on LAB titers, notably polypropylene glycol, caproic acid, pyrazine, and chondroitin sulfate; however, none were correlated with the dietary intake variables. These findings suggest that dietary variables may drive the presence of LAB in the human gastrointestinal tract and potentially impact response to probiotic interventions.

AB During mild or moderate exercise, alveolar ventilation increases in direct proportion to metabolic rate, regulating arterial CO2 pressure near resting levels. Mechanisms giving rise to the hyperpnoea of exercise are unsettled despite over a century of investigation. In the past three decades, neuroscience has advanced tremendously, raising optimism that the 'exercise hyperpnoea dilemma' can finally be solved. In this review, new perspectives are offered in the hope of stimulating original ideas based on modern neuroscience methods and current understanding. We first describe the ventilatory control system and the challenge exercise places upon blood-gas regulation. We highlight relevant system properties, including feedforward, feedback and adaptive (i.e., plasticity) control of breathing. We then elaborate a seldom explored hypothesis that the exercise ventilatory response continuously adapts (learns and relearns) throughout life and ponder if the memory 'engram' encoding the feedforward exercise ventilatory stimulus could reside within the cerebellum. Our hypotheses are based on accumulating evidence supporting the cerebellum's role in motor learning and the numerous direct and indirect projections from deep cerebellar nuclei to brainstem respiratory neurons. We propose that cerebellar learning may be obligatory for the accurate and adjustable exercise hyperpnoea capable of tracking changes in life conditions/experiences, and that learning arises from specific cerebellar microcircuits that can be interrogated using powerful techniques such as optogenetics and chemogenetics. Although this review is speculative, we consider it essential to reframe our perspective if we are to solve the till-now intractable exercise hyperpnoea dilemma.
   What is the topic of this review? This review reframes our perspective on the control of breathing during mild or moderate exercise, emphasising concepts of learning, memory and plasticity. What advances does it highlight? We propose that exercise hyperpnoea continuously adapts to ever-changing life conditions/experiences. We question if the memory 'engram' encoding exercise hyperpnoea resides within the cerebellum and outline powerful new methods to test this hypothesis. It is our hope that this review generates new ideas and renewed study of exercise hyperpnoea in the 21st century.

AB Thousands of images and videos are collected from construction projects during construction. These contain valuable data that, if harnessed efficiently, can help automate or at least reduce human effort in diverse construction management activities such as progress monitoring, safety management, quality control and productivity tracking. Extracting meaningful information from images requires the development of technology and algorithms that enable computers to understand digital images or videos, replicating the functionality of human visual systems. This is the goal of computer vision. This review aims at providing an updated and categorized overview of computer vision applications in construction by examining the recent developments in the field and identifying the opportunities and challenges that future research needs to address to fully leverage the potential benefits of Computer Vision. We restrict the focus to four areas that can benefit the most from computer vision Safety Management, Progress Monitoring, Productivity Tracking and Quality Control.

AB Introduction Autistic people experience higher risk of suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempts (SA) compared to non-autistic people, yet there is limited understanding of complex, multilevel factors that drive this disparity. Further, determinants of mental health service receipt among this population are unknown. This study will identify socioecological factors associated with increased risk of SI and SA for autistic people and evaluate determinants of mental health care receipt.Methods This study will link information for individuals aged 12-64 years in healthcare claims data (IBM (R) MarketScan (R) Research Database and CMS Medicaid) to publicly available databases containing community and policy factors, thereby creating a unique, multilevel dataset that includes health, demographic, community, and policy information. Machine learning data reduction methods will be applied to reduce the dimensionality prior to nested, multilevel empirical estimation. These techniques will allow for robust identification of clusters of socioecological factors associated with 1) risk of SI and SA and 2) receipt of mental health services (type, dose, delivery modality). Throughout, the research team will partner with an established group of autistic partners to promote community relevance, as well as receive input and guidance from a council of policy and practice advisors.Discussion We hypothesize that nested individual (co-occurring conditions, age, sex), community (healthcare availability, social vulnerabilities), and policy factors (state mental health legislation, state Medicaid expansion) will be associated with heightened risk of SI and SA, and that receipt, dose, and delivery of mental health services will be associated with interdependent factors at all three levels. The approach will lead to identification of multilevel clusters of risk and factors that facilitate or impede mental health service delivery. The study team will then engage the community partners, and policy and practice advisors to inform development of recommendations to reduce risk and improve mental health for the autistic population.

   PATHWAYS; NUCLEUS; EPHRINS; PATTERN
AB Vertebrates have evolved electrosensory receptors that detect electrical stimuli on the surface of the skin and transmit them somatotopically to the brain. In chondrichthyans, the electrosensory system is composed of a cephalic network of ampullary organs, known as the ampullae of Lorenzini, that can detect extremely weak electric fields during hunting and navigation. Each ampullary organ consists of a gel-filled epidermal pit containing sensory hair cells, and synaptic connections with primary afferent neurons at the base of the pit that facilitate detection of voltage gradients over large regions of the body. The developmental origin of electroreceptors and the mechanisms that determine their spatial arrangement in the vertebrate head are not well understood. We have analyzed electroreceptor development in the lesser spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula) and show that Sox8 and HNK1, two markers of the neural crest lineage, selectively mark sensory cells in ampullary organs. This represents the first evidence that the neural crest gives rise to electrosensory cells. We also show that pathfinding by cephalic mechanosensory and electrosensory axons follows the expression pattern of EphA4, a well-known guidance cue for axons and neural crest cells in osteichthyans. Expression of EphrinB2, which encodes a ligand for EphA4, marks the positions at which ampullary placodes are initiated in the epidermis, and EphA4 is expressed in surrounding mesenchyme. These results suggest that Eph-Ephrin signaling may establish an early molecular map for neural crest migration, axon guidance and placodal morphogenesis during development of the shark electrosensory system.

ID COMPUTER VISION
AB Separation of unshelled peanuts containing three or more kernels and then niche marketing them can potentially increase the value of unshelled peanuts and thus the profit of peanut producers or processors. Effective identification of peanut pods with three or more kernels is a critical step prior to separation. In this study, a machine vision system was teamed up with neural network technique to discriminate unshelled peanuts into two groups: one with three or more kernels and the other with two or less kernels. A set of physical features including the number of bumps, projected area, length and perimeter, etc., were extracted from the images taken and used to train an artificial neural network for discriminating the peanuts. It was found that among all the selected features, the length, the major axis length and perimeter have the best correlation with the number of kernels (correlation coefficient r = 0.87-0.88); the area and convex area have good correlation (r = 0.85); the eccentricity, number of bumps, and the compactness have relatively lower correction (r = 0.77-0.80); the solidity and the minor axis length have the least correlation to the number of kernels (r = -0.415-0.26). The best discrimination accuracy obtained for peanut pods with three or more kernels was 92.5% for the conditions used in this study.

ID DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; DYSFUNCTION; DEFICITS;
   IMPACT; LOBE
AB Patients seeking deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery for Parkinson's disease (PD) typically undergo neuropsychological assessment to determine candidacy for surgery, with poor memory performance interpreted as a contraindication. Patients with PD may exhibit worse memory for word lists than for stories due to the lack of inherent organization in a list of unrelated words. Unfortunately, word list and story tasks are typically developed from different normative datasets, and the existence of a memory performance discrepancy in PD has been challenged. We compared recall of stories and word lists in 35 non-demented PD candidates for DBS. We administered commonly used neuropsychological measures of word list and story memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, Logical Memory), along with a second word list task that was co-normed with the story task. Age-corrected scores were higher for the story task than for both word list tasks. Compared to story recall, word list recall correlated more consistently with motor severity and composite measures of processing speed, working memory, and executive functioning. These results support the classic view of fronto-subcortical contributions to memory in PD and suggest that executive deficits may influence word list recall more than story recall. We recommend a multi-componential memory battery in the neuropsychological assessment of DBS candidates to characterize both mesial temporal and frontal-executive memory processes. One should not rely solely on a word list task because patients exhibiting poor memory for word lists may perform better with stories and therefore deserve an interdisciplinary discussion for DBS surgery.

ID FOURIER DESCRIPTORS
AB We present a novel set of shape descriptors that represents a digitized pattern in a concise way and that is particularly well-suited for the recognition of handprinted characters. The descriptor set is derived from the wavelet transform of a pattern's contour. The approach is closely related to Feature extraction methods by Fourier series expansion. The motivation to use an orthonormal wavelet basis rather than the Fourier basis is that wavelet coefficients provide localized frequency information, and that wavelets allow us to decompose a function into a multiresolution hierarchy of localized frequency bands. We describe a character recognition system that relies upon wavelet descriptors to simultaneously analyze character shape at multiple levels of resolution. The system was trained and tested on a large database of more than 6000 samples of handprinted alphanumeric characters. The results show that wavelet descriptors are an efficient representation that can provide for reliable recognition in problems with large input variability.

AB Lespedeza cuneata (L. cuneata) is an invasive legume threatening grassland ecosystems of several states in the U.S. Mapping the occurrence of invasive species is the necessary first step to control their spread. Imaging spectroscopy or hyperspectral remote sensing imagery has shown its effectiveness in detecting invasive plants. However, challenges such as limited access to hyperspectral imagery, coarse temporal resolution, high costs, and lack of standardized analysis approaches have limited their application in monitoring biological invasions. Here, we aimed to take advantage of fine spatial and temporal resolution of PlanetScope multispectral satellite data and develop an effective approach to detect L. cuneata in a naturally assembled grassland ecosystem. To achieve this objective, we first sampled a suite of foliar functional traits in the field and identified key traits that distinguish L. cuneata from native plants. We then used our airborne hyperspectral data to select vegetation indices that are associated with the key traits while focusing on those indices that are applicable to satellite-derived multispectral data. We developed seven machine learning models and a decision fusion approach using layers of vegetation indices to map L. cuneata during the growing season. Using our approach, we were able to map L. cuneata with high level of accuracy using PlanetScope multispectral imagery. Our results suggested that the optimal period for detecting L. cuneata in our site was mid-to-late growing season, with an overall classification accuracy of 80.49 +/- 5.69% (mid-August) and 82.02 +/- 4.66% (end of September), respectively. Our study contributes to developing a cost-effective solution for mapping and monitoring invasive plants, which is essential for effective control of biological invasions.

AB This paper presents a novel neutral-pion reconstruction that takes advantage of the machine learning technique of semantic segmentation using MINERvA data collected between 2013-2017, with an average neutrino energy of 6 GeV. Semantic segmentation improves the purity of neutral pion reconstruction from two gamma s from 70.7 +/- 0.9% to 89.3 +/- 0.7% and improves the efficiency of the reconstruction by approximately 40%. We demonstrate our method in a charged current neutral pion production analysis where a single neutral pion is reconstructed. This technique is applicable to modern tracking calorimeters, such as the new generation of liquid-argon time projection chambers, exposed to neutrino beams with < E-nu > between 1-10 GeV. In such experiments it can facilitate the identification of ionization hits which are associated with electromagnetic showers, thereby enabling improved reconstruction of charged-current nu(e) events arising from nu(mu) -> nu(e) appearance.

AB Osteoderms are bony plates found in the skin of vertebrates, mostly commonly in reptiles where they have evolved independently multiple times, suggesting the presence of a gene regulatory network that is readily activated and inactivated. They are absent in birds and mammals except for the armadillo. However, we have discovered that in one subfamily of rodents, the Deomyinae, there are osteoderms in the skin of their tails. Osteoderm development begins in the proximal tail skin and is complete 6 weeks after birth. RNA sequencing has identified the gene networks involved in their differentiation. There is a widespread downregulation of keratin genes and an up-regulation of osteoblast genes and a finely balanced expression of signaling pathways as the osteoderms differentiate. Future comparisons with reptilian osteoderms may allow us to understand how these structures have evolved and why they are so rare in mammals.

AB Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in American men. Management depends on the staging of prostate cancer. Only cancers that are confined to organs of origin are potentially curable. The article considers a hierarchical Bayesian neural network approach for posterior prediction probabilities of certain features indicative of non-organ-confined prostate cancer. The Bayesian procedure is implemented by an application of the Markov chain Monte Carlo numerical integration technique. For the problem at hand, the hierarchical Bayesian neural network approach is shown to be superior to the approach based on hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression model as well as the classical feedforward neural networks.

AB Citrus Black Spot (CBS), caused by the pathogenic fungus Phyllosticta citricarpa, is a quarantine citrus disease, that has the potential to spread on nursery tress especially in regions like Florida and beyond. The early detection of this disease assumes paramount importance, especially during the asymptomatic phase of tree infection. This critical stage offers a window of opportunity for grove managers to implement preemptive measures, thereby mitigating the potential dissemination of the infection within orchards. In the present study, we elucidate the robust capabilities of the Contamination Sanitization Inspection-Disinfection Plus (CSI-D+) system, which integrates state-of-the-art fluorescence imaging technology, in tandem with the YOLOv8 deep learning framework. Our investigation is centered on the direct detection of conidia of the CBS-causing fungus P. citricarpa (Gc12) and its non-pathogenic counterpart P. capitalensis (Gm33), both prevalent on surfaces of infected citrus leaves across varying concentration gradients. Impressively, the CSI-D+ system (which is a new, handheld fluorescence-based imaging device developed to detect microbial contamination and disinfect surfaces rapidly) exhibits remarkable discriminatory acumen, achieving a noteworthy mean classification accuracy of 96.97 % for Gc12 fungus classification. This precision is complemented by an impressive F1-score of 96.35 %, coupled with a commendable mAP@50 score of 97.82 %. Furthermore, our inquiry extends to encompass the Gm33 variant, wherein the system maintains a commendable average classification accuracy of 96.17 %, alongside an F1-score of 88.76 %, and a mAP@50 of 91.64 %. Such pioneering systems bear substantial promise, serving as a rapid, non-invasive instrument for the early identification of incipient CBS infestations within citrus arboreal landscapes. In equipping grove managers with timely insights, these advancements stand to empower effective and timely intervention strategies, fortifying orchard resilience against the progression of this pathogenic menace.

AB Nonlinear similarity measures defined in kernel space, such as correntropy, can extract higher order statistics of data and offer potentially significant performance improvement over their linear counterparts especially in non Gaussian signal processing and machine learning. In this paper, we propose a new similarity measure in kernel space, called the kernel risk-sensitive loss (KRSL), and provide some important properties. We apply the KRSL to adaptive filtering and investigate the robustness, and then develop the MKRSL algorithm and analyze the mean square convergence performance. Compared with correntropy, the KRSL can offer a more efficient performance surface, thereby enabling a gradient-based method to achieve faster convergence speed and higher accuracy while still maintaining the robustness to outliers. Theoretical analysis results and superior performance of the new algorithm are confirmed by simulation.

AB This paper is to provide practical options for prognostics so that beginners can select appropriate methods for their fields of application. To achieve this goal, several popular algorithms are first reviewed in the data-driven and physics-based prognostics methods. Each algorithm's attributes and pros and cons are analyzed in terms of model definition, model parameter estimation and ability to handle noise and bias in data. Fatigue crack growth examples are then used to illustrate the characteristics of different algorithms. In order to suggest a suitable algorithm, several studies are made based on the number of data sets, the level of noise and bias, availability of loading and physical models, and complexity of the damage growth behavior. Based on the study, it is concluded that the Gaussian process is easy and fast to implement, but works well only when the covariance function is properly defined. The neural network has the advantage in the case of large noise and complex models but only with many training data sets. The particle filter and Bayesian method are superior to the former methods because they are less affected by noise and model complexity, but work only when physical model and loading conditions are available.

AB The central nervous system (CNS) control of human gait is complex, including descending cortical control, affective ascending neural pathways, interhemispheric communication, whole brain networks of functional connectivity, and neural interactions between the brain and spinal cord. Many important studies were conducted in the past, which administered gait training using externally targeted methods such as treadmill, weight support, over-ground gait coordination training, functional electrical stimulation, bracing, and walking aids. Though the phenomenon of CNS activity-dependent plasticity has served as a basis for more recently developed gait training methods, neurorehabilitation gait training has yet to be precisely focused and quantified according to the CNS source of gait control. Therefore, we offer the following hypotheses to the field: Hypothesis 1. Gait neurorehabilitation after stroke will move forward in important ways if research studies include brain structural and functional characteristics as measures of response to treatment. Hypothesis 2. Individuals with persistent gait dyscoordination after stroke will achieve greater recovery in response to interventions that incorporate the current and emerging knowledge of CNS function by directly engaging CNS plasticity and pairing it with peripherally directed, plasticity-based motor learning interventions. These hypotheses are justified by the increase in the study of neural control of motor function, with emerging research beginning to elucidate neural factors that drive recovery. Some are developing new measures of brain function. A number of groups have developed and are sharing sophisticated, curated databases containing brain images and brain signal data, as well as other types of measures and signal processing methods for data analysis. It will be to the great advantage of stroke survivors if the results of the current state-of-the-art and emerging neural function research can be applied to the development of new gait training interventions.

AB CFD analysis of heat and mass flow due to natural convection in partitioned enclosures has recently been the focus of many CFD researchers. In some cases, it was reported in the literature that: different CFD solutions (due to different numerical stability characteristics) were obtained for different mesh quality, time step, and discretization order. The objective of this paper is to investigate the feasibility of using neural networks (NNs) as a means lending support to the authenticity of steady-state CFD solutions for such ill-posed problems through inter-model comparisons. Attention is focused on using NNs trained on a database generated by numerically-stable CFD analysis to predict flow variables for the aforementioned ill-posed cases, thereby giving confidence in steady-state CFD results for these cases. Three types of NNs were evaluated and parametric studies were performed to optimize network designs for best predictions of the flow variables.
   A validated CFD code was used to generate a database that covered the range of Rayleigh number Ra from 10(4) to 4.7 x 10(6). The CFD analysis was used to calculate the normalized temperature theta and stream function psi throughout a partitioned enclosure. The results of the CFD were used to train and test the neural networks. The robustness of the trained NNs was tested by applying them to a number of "production" data sets that the networks have never "seen" before. The trained NNs were used to verify CFD solutions in cases of higher Ra ranges for which CFD simulations produce different solutions for different discretization schemes. The results showed that it is possible to design and train certain architectures of NNs to accurately predict theta and psi distribution within the enclosure, and hence impart confidence in the legitimacy of CFD solutions for new cases.

AB Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a neuromodulatory therapy that has been FDA approved for the treatment of various disorders, including but not limited to, movement disorders (e.g., Parkinson's disease and essential tremor), epilepsy, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Computational methods for estimating the volume of tissue activated (VTA), coupled with brain imaging techniques, form the basis of models that are being generated from retrospective clinical studies for predicting DBS patient outcomes. For instance, VTA models are used to generate target-and network-based probabilistic stimulation maps that play a crucial role in predicting DBS treatment outcomes. This review defines the methods for calculation of tissue activation (or modulation) including ones that use heuristic and clinically derived estimates and more computationally involved ones that rely on finite-element methods and biophysical axon models. We define model parameters and provide a comparison of commercial, open-source, and academic simulation platforms available for integrated neuroimaging and neural activation prediction. In addition, we review clinical studies that use these modeling methods as a function of disease. By describing the tissue-activation modeling methods and highlighting their application in clinical studies, we provide the neural engineering and clinical neuromodulation communities with perspectives that may influence the adoption of modeling methods for future DBS studies.

AB Objective. 4D-CBCT provides phase-resolved images valuable for radiomics analysis for outcome prediction throughout treatment courses. However, 4D-CBCT suffers from streak artifacts caused by under-sampling, which severely degrades the accuracy of radiomic features. Previously we developed group-patient-trained deep learning methods to enhance the 4D-CBCT quality for radiomics analysis, which was not optimized for individual patients. In this study, a patient-specific model was developed to further improve the accuracy of 4D-CBCT based radiomics analysis for individual patients. Approach. This patient-specific model was trained with intra-patient data. Specifically, patient planning 4D-CT was augmented through image translation, rotation, and deformation to generate 305 CT volumes from 10 volumes to simulate possible patient positions during the onboard image acquisition. 72 projections were simulated from 4D-CT for each phase and were used to reconstruct 4D-CBCT using FDK back-projection algorithm. The patient-specific model was trained using these 305 paired sets of patient-specific 4D-CT and 4D-CBCT data to enhance the 4D-CBCT image to match with 4D-CT images as ground truth. For model testing, 4D-CBCT were simulated from a separate set of 4D-CT scan images acquired from the same patient and were then enhanced by this patient-specific model. Radiomics features were then extracted from the testing 4D-CT, 4D-CBCT, and enhanced 4D-CBCT image sets for comparison. The patient-specific model was tested using 4 lung-SBRT patients' data and compared with the performance of the group-based model. The impact of model dimensionality, region of interest (ROI) selection, and loss function on the model accuracy was also investigated. Main results. Compared with a group-based model, the patient-specific training model further improved the accuracy of radiomic features, especially for features with large errors in the group-based model. For example, the 3D whole-body and ROI loss-based patient-specific model reduces the errors of the first-order median feature by 83.67%, the wavelet LLL feature maximum by 91.98%, and the wavelet HLL skewness feature by 15.0% on average for the four patients tested. In addition, the patient-specific models with different dimensionality (2D versus 3D) or loss functions (L1 versus L1 + VGG + GAN) achieved comparable results for improving the radiomics accuracy. Using whole-body or whole-body+ROI L1 loss for the model achieved better results than using the ROI L1 loss alone as the loss function. Significance. This study demonstrated that the patient-specific model is more effective than the group-based model on improving the accuracy of the 4D-CBCT radiomic features analysis, which could potentially improve the precision for outcome prediction in radiotherapy.

AB This study was performed to analyze the accuracy of health-related information on Twitter during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Authors queried Twitter on three dates for information regarding COVID-19 and five terms (cure, emergency or emergency room, prevent or prevention, treat or treatments, vitamins or supplements) assessing the first 25 results with health-related information. Tweets were authoritative if written by governments, hospitals, or physicians. Two physicians assessed each tweet for accuracy. Metrics were compared between accurate and inaccurate tweets using chi(2) analysis and Mann-Whitney U. A total of 25.4% of tweets were inaccurate. Accurate tweets were more likely written by Twitter authenticated authors (49.8% vs. 20.9%, 28.9% difference, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 17.7-38.2) with accurate tweet authors having more followers (19,491 vs. 7346; 3446 difference, 95% CI: 234-14,054) versus inaccurate tweet authors. Likes, retweets, tweet length, botometer scores, writing grade level, and rank order did not differ between accurate and inaccurate tweets. We found 1/4 of health-related COVID-19 tweets inaccurate indicating that the public should not rely on COVID-19 health information written on Twitter. Ideally, improved government regulatory authority, public/private industry oversight, independent fact-checking, and artificial intelligence algorithms are needed to ensure inaccurate information on Twitter is removed.

DE skin biopsy; shave biopsy; punch biopsy; excision biopsy; internists
AB OBJECTIVE: To review three commonly performed skin biopsy procedures: shave, punch, and excision,
   DATA SOURCES: English-language articles identified through a MEDLINE search (1966-1997] using the MeSH headings skin and biopsy, major dermatology and primary care textbooks, and cross-references.
   STUDY SELECTION Articles that reviewed the indications, contraindications, choice of procedure, surgical technique, specimen handling, and wound care,
   DATA EXTRACTION: Information was manually extracted from all selected articles and texts: emphasis was placed on information relevant to internal medicine physicians who want to learn skin biopsy techniques,
   DATA SYNTHESIS: Shave biopsies require the least experience and time but are limited to superficial, nonpigmented lesions. Punch biopsies are simple to perform, have few complications, and if small, can heal without suturing. Closing the wound with unbraided nylon on a C-17 needle will enhance the cosmetic result but requires more expertise and time, Elliptical excisions are ideal for removing large or deep lesions, provide abundant material for many studies, and can be curative for a number of conditions, but require the greatest amount of time, expertise, and office resources, Elliptical excisions can be closed with unbraided nylon using a CE-3 or FS-3 needle in thick skin or a P-3 needle on the face, All specimens should be submitted in a labeled container with a brief clinical description and working diagnosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: Skin biopsies ate an essential technique in the management of skin diseases and can enhance the dermatologic care rendered by internists.

AB Objective Pilot testing of real time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) and real time functional near infrared spectroscopy (rt-fNIRS) as brain computer interface (BCI) neural feedback systems combined with motor learning for motor recovery in chronic severely impaired stroke survivors.
   Approach We enrolled a four-case series and administered three sequential rt-fMRI and ten rt-fNIRS neural feedback sessions interleaved with motor learning sessions. Measures were: Arm Motor Assessment Tool, functional domain (AMAT-F; 13 complex functional tasks), Fugl-Meyer arm coordination scale (FM); active wrist extension range of motion (ROM); volume of activation (fMRI); and fNIRS HbO concentration. Performance during neural feedback was assessed, in part, using percent successful brain modulations during rt-fNIRS.
   Main results Pre-/post-treatment mean clinically significant improvement in AMAT-F (.49 0.22) and FM (10.0 3.3); active wrist ROM improvement ranged from 20 degrees to 50 degrees. Baseline to follow-up change in brain signal was as follows: fMRI volume of activation was reduced in almost all ROIs for three subjects, and for one subject there was an increase or no change; fNIRS HbO was within normal range, except for one subject who increased beyond normal at post-treatment. During rt-fNIRS neural feedback training, there was successful brain signal modulation (42%-78%).
   Significance Severely impaired stroke survivors successfully engaged in spatially focused BCI systems, rt-fMRI and rt-fNIRS, to clinically significantly improve motor function. At the least, equivalency in motor recovery was demonstrated with prior long-duration motor learning studies (without neural feedback), indicating that no loss of motor improvement resulted from substituting neural feedback sessions for motor learning sessions. Given that the current neural feedback protocol did not prevent the motor improvements observed in other long duration studies, even in the presence of fewer sessions of motor learning in the current work, the results support further study of neural feedback and its potential for recovery of motor function in stroke survivors. In future work, expanding the sophistication of either or both rt-fMRI and rt-fNIRS could hold the potential for further reducing the number of hours of training needed and/or the degree of recovery.

AB Soil temperature is a very important variable in agricultural meteorology and strongly influences agricultural activities and planning (e.g. the date and depth of sowing crops, frost protection). There are many physically based studies in the literature which model soil temperature, but few are easily applicable for use in the field. Simple and precise short-term forecasting of soil temperature with minimum data requirements is the main goal of this study. The soil temperature at 0300, 0900 and 1500 GMT was forecast based only on surface air temperatures using artificial neural network (ANN) and wavelet transform artificial neural network (WANN) models. The hourly data were collected from the Mashhad synoptic station in Khorasan Razavi province in Iran between 2010 and 2013. The results of this study showed that using a wavelet transform for preprocessing improved the accuracy of soil temperature forecasting. It was also found that changing the temporal increment in forecasting time did not have a noticeable effect on errors in the WANN models. WANN models can be used as accurate tools to forecast soil temperature 1-7days ahead at depths of 5-30cm.

AB An upper motor neuron lesion (UMNL) can be caused by various neurological disorders or trauma and leads to disabilities. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is a technique that is widely used for rehabilitation and restoration of motor function for people suffering from UMNL. Typically, stability analysis for closed-loop NMES ignores the modulated implementation of NMES. However, electrical stimulation must be applied to muscle as a modulated series of pulses. In this paper, a muscle activation model with an amplitude modulated control input is developed to capture the discontinuous nature of muscle activation, and an identification-based closed-loop NMES controller is designed and analyzed for the uncertain amplitude modulated muscle activation model. Semi-global uniformly ultimately bounded tracking is guaranteed. The stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed with Lyapunov-based methods, and a pulse frequency related gain condition is obtained. Experiments are performed with five able-bodied subjects to demonstrate the interplay between the control gains and the pulse frequency, and results are provided which indicate that control gains should be increased to maintain stability if the stimulation pulse frequency is decreased to mitigate muscle fatigue. For the first time, this paper brings together an analysis of the controller and modulation scheme.

AB Autoencoder reconstruction-based unsupervised damage detection is widely utilized in structural health monitoring. However, such methods typically necessitate a comprehensive collection of historical guided waves as training data. Acquiring such data presents challenges, as it requires prolonged monitoring to cover various environmental and operational conditions (EOCs), making these methods less practical for real-world applications. This paper proposes an unsupervised damage detection method solely trained on the current measurements directly. To improve the performance of the unsupervised damage detection method when the training data (the current measurements ) contains a large ratio of damage-induced guided waves, two noise-augmentation strategies are designed to limit the neural network's learning ability to recover damage-induced guided waves from their segments, improving detection performance. Additionally, we use t-SNE to visualize the impact of noise augmentation on the separation of different types of guided waves within the recovery network's latent space. Experimental results indicate that input signals with relatively low SNR can achieve better damage detection performance, and a strategy for estimating the optimal noise intensity in input signals is provided in this paper. The effectiveness of the unsupervised this damage detection method with noise-augmentation strategy is validated by 10 regions of 80-days guided waves collected from uncontrolled and dynamic environmental conditions.

AB Covariance estimation for high-dimensional datasets is a fundamental problem in machine learning, and has numerous applications. In these high-dimensional settings the number of features or variables p is typically larger than the sample size n. A popular way of tackling this challenge is to induce sparsity in the covariance matrix, its inverse or a relevant transformation. In many applications, the data come with a natural ordering. In such settings, methods inducing sparsity in the Cholesky parameter of the inverse covariance matrix can be quite useful. Such methods are also better positioned to yield a positive definite estimate of the covariance matrix, a critical requirement for several downstream applications. Despite some important advances in this area, a principled approach to general sparse-Cholesky based covariance estimation with both statistical and algorithmic convergence safeguards has been elusive. In particular, the two popular likelihood based methods proposed in the literature either do not lead to a well-defined estimator in high-dimensional settings, or consider only a restrictive class of models. In this paper, we propose a principled and general method for sparse-Cholesky based covariance estimation that aims to overcome some of the shortcomings of current methods, but retains their respective strengths. We obtain a jointly convex formulation for our objective function, and show that it leads to rigorous convergence guarantees and well-defined estimators, even when p>n. Very importantly, the approach always leads to a positive definite and symmetric estimator of the covariance matrix. We establish both high-dimensional estimation and selection consistency, and also demonstrate excellent finite sample performance on simulated/real data.

AB Bladder cancer is the fifth most commonly diagnosed malignancy in the United States and one of the most prevalent worldwide. It harbors a probability of recurrence of > 50%; thus, rigorous, long-term surveillance of patients is advocated. Flexible cystoscopy coupled with voided urine cytology is the primary diagnostic approach, but cystoscopy is an uncomfortable, invasive procedure and the sensitivity of voided urine cytology is poor in all but high-grade tumors. Thus, improvements in noninvasive urinalysis assessment strategies would benefit patients. We applied gene expression microarray analysis to exfoliated urothelia recovered from bladder washes obtained prospectively from 46 patients with subsequently confirmed presence or absence of bladder cancer. Data from microarrays containing 56,000 targets was subjected to a panel of statistical analyses to identify bladder cancer-associated gene signatures. Hierarchical clustering and supervised learning algorithms were used to classify samples on the basis of tumor burden. A differentially expressed geneset of 319 gene probes was associated with the presence of bladder cancer (P < 0.01), and visualization of protein interaction networks revealed vascular endothelial growth factor and angiotensinogen as pivotal factors in tumor cells. Supervised machine learning and a cross-validation approach were used to build a 14-gene molecular classifier that was able to classify patients with and without bladder cancer with an overall accuracy of 76%. Our results show that it is possible to achieve the detection of bladder cancer using molecular signatures present in exfoliated tumor urothelia. Further investigation and validation of the cancer-associated profiles may reveal important biomarkers for the noninvasive detection and surveillance of bladder cancer.

AB This study contributes to quantifying the coupling impacts of multiple factors including traffic, meteorology, and built environment on particle (PM) distributions at urban neighborhood scales. Increasing knowledge of the PM distribution characteristics and the quantification of multifactorial effects could assist in alleviating pollution. However, the contribution of multiple factors and their coupling effects to PM concentrations have not been quantified adequately. Meanwhile, the vertical distribution patterns above 10 m in urban near-road areas, which are closely related to the residents' exposure in high-rise buildings, are rarely revealed. To bridge the research gaps, this study developed an integrated method of unmanned aerial vehicle measurement and Explainable Boosting Machine to reveal the vertical PM distributions and quantify the coupling effects of traffic, meteorology, and built environments. Results show that the PM concentrations at 9-18 m are significantly higher than those at ground level. Moreover, background concentration (20.9%), traffic volume (15.6%), and street morphology (11.4%) are the top three important features. The coupling effects of selected features, especially the interplay between wind factors and monitoring position, account for 8.9% of PM concentrations. This study provides insights into source identification of particles and improving livability and sustainability in urban residential areas.

DE Artificial neural network; Distributed model; Rainfall-runoff; Watershed
AB Distributed models capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of hydrologic processes such as rainfall-runoff, which enable them to be more insightful tools for watershed management. Although artificial neural network (ANN) offers a framework for developing cause-effect relationships, the majority of the ANN-based hydrologic models are lumped. This study explores the ability of an ANN to represent the spatiotemporal dynamics of a watershed process. A distributed ANN (d4NN) model was developed using a cascade-forward. multi-layer perceptron model framework to represent the RR process. The model was tested for a sample watershed, the L'Anguille River watershed in eastern Arkansas. This model incorporated the known spatial dynamics of rainfall and flow in the watershed through laterally connected blocks that represented subbasins. The model had high predictability, simulated the flow with high accuracy (RMSE = 0.15 to 0.37 mm, R-2 = 0.93 to 0.99) at daily time scale when compared to measured flow, and represented the spatial dynamics of flow as well as the SWAT model. The d4NN model can be a computationally efficient tool for simulating spatiotemporally dynamic watershed processes, which can expand its applications into water quality modeling, flood forecasting, and watershed management.

AB The etiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) is complex and largely unclear. Among various lines of inquiry, many have suggested convergence onto disruptions in both neural circuitry and immune regulation/glial cell function pathways. However, the interpretation of the relationship between these two putative mechanisms has largely focused on the role of exogenous factors and insults, such as maternal infection, in activating immune pathways that in turn result in neural network abnormalities. Yet, given recent insights into our understanding of human neurodevelopment, and in particular the critical role of glia and the immune system in normal brain development, it is important to consider these putative pathological processes in their appropriate normal neurodevelopmental context. In this review, we explore the hypothesis that the autistic brain cellular phenotype likely represents intrinsic abnormalities of glial/immune processes constitutively operant in normal brain development that result in the observed neural network dysfunction. We review recent studies demonstrating the intercalated role of neural circuit development, the immune system, and glial cells in the normal developing brain, and integrate them with studies demonstrating pathological alterations in these processes in autism. By discussing known abnormalities in the autistic brain in the context of normal brain development, we explore the hypothesis that the glial/immune component of ASD may instead be related to intrinsic exaggerated/abnormal constitutive neurodevelopmental processes such as network pruning. Moreover, this hypothesis may be relevant to other neurodevelopmental disorders that share genetic, pathologic, and clinical features with autism.

AB A novel invariant pattern recognition machine is proposed based on a modified ART architecture. Invariance is achieved by adding a new layer called F23, beyond the F2 layer in the ART architecture. The design of the weight connections between the nodes of the F2 layer and the cells of the F3 layer are similar to the invariance net. Computer simulations show that the model is not only invariant to translations and rotations of 2-D binary images but also noise-tolerant to these transformed images.

AB Carbon functional materials (CFMs) such as biochar and hydrochar can be obtained from hundreds of biomass precursors varying from urban sludge to agriculture wastes. They can be produced through tens of synthesis methods and postsynthesis processing steps tuned at specific conditions (e.g., temperature, time, and chemical concentrations). To achieve a "rational design" platform for a system with a high dimensional parameter space such as CFMs, we processed 10,975 scientific articles (from years 2000 to 2020) related to the subject with automatic reading-interpreting-extracting computational routines (namely, the a.RIX engine). The a.RIX engine automatically recognized more than a hundred precursors, among which wheat straw, rice husk, and rice straw were the most studied for CFM synthesis and application in agriculture (e.g., as an amendment), as fuel (energy generation), and as an adsorbent. Parameters related to the CFMs' synthesis conditions, such as carbonization temperature and time, and parameters related to CFMs' properties, such as surface area and heavy metals adsorption capacity, can also be extracted from the articles. Correlations between the CFM precursors and synthesis conditions indicated very little statistical difference between the carbonization temperature and time used for the CFMs' synthesis from different precursors. Essentially, precursors are carbonized at temperatures varying from 100 to 900 degrees C for 30 min to 6 h using pyrolysis, hydrothermal carbonization, and gasification. When focusing the analysis on just CFMs produced by pyrolysis (biochar), we observed that peanut shells can produce materials with higher surface areas than other precursors (P < 0.05). When performing correlations between biochar synthesis conditions and their properties, general trends can be confirmed: (i) the higher the carbonization temperature, the lower the H/C and O/C ratios, and (ii) the increase in the surface area can be achieved by preserving a high aromatic degree (low H/C ratio) and a low oxidation level (low O/C ratio). However, a deeper understanding of the relation between CFM synthesis/postsynthesis methods and the resulting properties can only be achieved using clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means) and complex network analysis. The a.RIX engine groups articles describing optimized synthesis conditions and CFM properties (e.g., low carbonization temperature, low carbonization time, and large surface area and adsorption capacity) and automatically recognizes the synthesis/postsynthesis steps used for these groups. The program efficiently recognized that precursors such as peanut shells can be converted into highly porous biochar by using experimental routes such as "pyrolysis" -> "activation" -> "drying" -> "ashing" -> "washing" -> "filtration." With this approach, we show that a noncomputational review of scientific articles for materials with a huge parameter space such as CFMs is largely obsolete. Finally, taken together, the results provide a powerful platform for data-oriented experimental design of CFMs produced from biomass.

AB Ranking function is instrumental in affecting the performance of a search engine. Designing and optimizing a search engine's ranking function remains a daunting task for computer and information scientists. Recently, genetic programming (GP), a machine learning technique based on evolutionary theory, has shown promise in tackling this very difficult problem. Ranking functions discovered by GP have been found to be significantly better than many of the other existing ranking functions. However, current GP implementations for ranking function discovery are all designed utilizing the Vector Space model in which the same term weighting strategy is applied to all terms in a document. This may not be an ideal representation scheme at the individual query level considering the fact that many query terms should play different roles in the final ranking. In this paper, we propose a novel nonlinear ranking function representation scheme and compare this new design to the well-known Vector Space model. We theoretically show that the new representation scheme subsumes the traditional Vector Space model representation scheme as a special case and hence allows for additional flexibility in term weighting. We test the new representation scheme with the GP-based discovery framework in a personalized search (information routing) context using a TREC web corpus. The experimental results show that the new ranking function representation design outperforms the traditional Vector Space model for GP-based ranking function discovery. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
LA English
DT Article
AB We present a follow-up method based on supervised machine learning (ML) to improve the performance in the search of gravitational wave (GW) bursts from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) using the coherent WaveBurst (cWB) pipeline. The ML model discriminates noise from signal events by using a set of reconstruction parameters provided by cWB as features. Detected noise events are discarded yielding a reduction in the false alarm rate (FAR) and the false alarm probability thus enhancing the statistical significance. We tested the proposed method using strain data from the first half of the third observing run of advanced LIGO, and CCSNe GW signals extracted from 3D simulations. The ML model is tuned using a dataset of noise and signal events, and then used to identify and discard noise events in the cWB analyses. Noise and signal reduction levels were examined in single (L1 and H1) and two detector network (L1H1). The FAR was reduced by a factor of-10 to-100 resulting in an enhancement in the statistical significance of-1?? to-2??, while not impacting the detection efficiencies.

AB In the light of the urgency raised by the COVID-19 pandemic, global investment in wildlife virology is likely to increase, and new surveillance programmes will identify hundreds of novel viruses that might someday pose a threat to humans. To support the extensive task of laboratory characterization, scientists may increasingly rely on data-driven rubrics or machine learning models that learn from known zoonoses to identify which animal pathogens could someday pose a threat to global health. We synthesize the findings of an interdisciplinary workshop on zoonotic risk technologies to answer the following questions. What are the prerequisites, in terms of open data, equity and interdisciplinary collaboration, to the development and application of those tools? What effect could the technology have on global health? Who would control that technology, who would have access to it and who would benefit from it? Would it improve pandemic prevention? Could it create new challenges? This article is part of the theme issue 'Infectious disease macroecology: parasite diversity and dynamics across the globe'.

AB The purpose of this study was to develop an automated method for classifying liver fibrosis stage >F2 based on ultrasound shear wave elastography (SWE) and to assess the system's performance in comparison with a reference manual approach. The reference approach consists of manually selecting a region of interest from each of eight or more SWE images, computing the mean tissue stiffness within each of the regions of interest and computing a resulting stiffness value as the median of the means. The 527-subject database consisted of 5526 SWE images and pathologist-scored biopsies, with data collected from a single system at a single site. The automated method integrates three modules that assess SWE image quality, select a region of interest from each SWE measurement and perform machine learning-based, multi-image SWE classification for fibrosis stage >= F2. Several classification methods were developed and tested using fivefold cross-validation with training, validation and test sets partitioned by subject. Performance metrics were area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), specificity at 95% sensitivity and number of SWE images required. The final automated method yielded an AUROC of 0.93 (95% confidence interval: 0.90-0.94) versus 0.69 (95% confidence interval: 0.65-0.72) for the reference method, 71% specificity with 95% sensitivity versus 5% and four images per decision versus eight or more. In conclusion, the automated method reported in this study significantly improved the accuracy for >F2 classification of SWE measurements as well as reduced the number of measurements needed, which has the potential to reduce clinical workflow.

AB BACKGROUND: Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) often leads to hypertension posttreatment. Evidence is lacking for the current >20 mm Hg peak-to-peak blood pressure (BP) gradient (BPGpp) guideline, which can cause aortic thickening, stiffening, and dysfunction. This study sought to find the BPGpp severity and duration that avoid persistent dysfunction in a preclinical model and test if predictors translate to hypertension status in patients with CoA. METHODS: Rabbits (n=75; 5-12/group) were exposed to mild, intermediate, or severe CoA (<= 12, 13-19, >= 20 mm Hg BPGpp) for approximate to 1, 3, or 22 weeks using dissolvable and permanent sutures with thickening, stiffening, contraction, and endothelial function evaluated via multivariate regression. Relevance to patients with CoA (n=239; age, 0.01-46 years; median 3.7 months) was tested by retrospective review of predictors (preoperative BPGpp, surgical age, etc.) versus follow-up hypertension status. RESULTS: CoA duration and severity were predictive of aortic remodeling and active dysfunction in rabbits, and hypertension in patients with CoA. Interaction between patient age and BPGpp at surgery contributed significantly to hypertension, similar to rabbits, suggesting preclinical findings translate to patients. Machine learning decision tree analysis uncovered that preoperative BPGpp and surgical age predict risk of hypertension along with residual postoperative BPGpp. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest the current BPGpp threshold determined decades ago is likely too high to prevent adverse coarctation-induced aortic remodeling. The results and decision tree analysis provide a foundation for revising CoA treatment guidelines considering the interaction between CoA severity and duration to limit the risk of hypertension.

AB Climate change involves long term changes in climate including increase in temperature, elevated CO2 and uneven distribution of rainfall quantity and periodicity. Though daily mean temperature (T-mean) is considered a widely useful index of assessment of climate change, averaging can obscure some of the variations expected in diurnal temperature range (DTR). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of DTR relative to T-mean as a metric for predicting millet yield using a combination of a historical dataset (1980-2010) and two climate model (MIROC5 and GFDL) projections for 2017-2046 under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 across two different environments (arid, Layyah and semi-arid, Faisalabad) of Punjab, Pakistan. Provincial datasets of pearl millet yields were collected and checked for an empirical relationship between T-mean, DTR and crop yield. The mean of projections showed increasing DTR relative to baseline in both environments. Projected T-max and T-min were highly correlated (0.90-0.99) for both environments and climate models. MIROC5 predicted T-max and T-min well and GFDL performed efficiently in predicting precipitation by 2046. The data also showed more hot days in future decades and erractic rainfall pattern by 2046 in both environments. The Genetic Algorithm (GA) appeared to be a good approach to assess climate change impact on pearl millet yield in Punjab, Pakistan, predicting negative yield impacts (11-12%) due to future warming. We suggest broadening tests of this method to other cases around the world, with similar climate regimes.

AB Recently, stereoscopic image quality assessment has attracted a lot attention. However, compared with 2D image quality assessment, it is much more difficult to assess the quality of stereoscopic images due to the lack of understanding of 3D visual perception. This paper proposes a novel no-reference quality assessment metric for stereoscopic images using natural scene statistics with consideration of both the quality of the cyclopean image and 3D visual perceptual information (binocular fusion and binocular rivalry). In the proposed method, not only is the quality of the cyclopean image considered, but binocular rivalry and other 3D visual intrinsic properties are also exploited. Specifically, in order to improve the objective quality of the cyclopean image, features of the cyclopean images in both the spatial domain and transformed domain are extracted based on the natural scene statistics (NSS) model. Furthermore, to better comprehend intrinsic properties of the stereoscopic image, in our method, the binocular rivalry effect and other 3D visual properties are also considered in the process of feature extraction. Following adaptive feature pruning using principle component analysis, improved metric accuracy can be found in our proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed metric can achieve a good and consistent alignment with subjective assessment of stereoscopic images in comparison with existing methods, with the highest SROCC (0.952) and PLCC (0.962) scores being acquired on the LIVE 3D database Phase I.

   EQUATION
AB Modern computational and experimental tools for aerodynamics and propulsion applications have matured to a stage where they can provide substantial insight into engineering processes involving fluid flows, and can be Fruitfully utilized to help improve the design of practical devices. In particular. rapid and continuous development in aerospace engineering demands that new design concepts be regularly proposed to meet goals for increased performance, robustness and safety while concurrently decreasing cost. To date, the majority of the effort in design optimization of fluid dynamics has relied on gradient-based search algorithms. Global optimization methods can utilize the information collected from various sources and by different tools. These methods offer multi-criterion optimization, handle the existence of multiple design points and trade-offs via insight into the entire design space, can easily perform tasks in parallel, and are often effective in filtering the noise intrinsic to numerical and experimental data. However, a successful application of the global optimization method needs to address issues related to data requirements with an increase in the number of design variables, and methods for predicting the model performance. In this article, we review recent progress made in establishing suitable global optimization techniques employing neural-network- and polynomial-based response surface methodologies. Issues addressed include techniques for construction of the response surface, design of experiment techniques for supplying information in an economical manner, optimization procedures and multi-level techniques, and assessment of relative performance between polynomials and neural networks. Examples drawn From wing aerodynamics, turbulent diffuser flows, gas-gas injectors, and supersonic turbines are employed to help demonstrate the issues involved in an engineering design context. Both the usefulness of the existing knowledge to aid current design practices and the need for future research are identified. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose of ReviewTo provide an overview of the impact of virtual and augmented reality in contemporary cardiovascular medical practice.Recent FindingsThe utilization of virtual and augmented reality has emerged as an innovative technique in various cardiovascular subspecialties, including interventional adult, pediatric, and adult congenital as well as structural heart disease and heart failure. In particular, electrophysiology has proven valuable for both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The incorporation of 3D reconstruction modeling has significantly enhanced our understanding of patient anatomy and morphology, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.SummaryThe interactive modeling of cardiac structure and function within the virtual realm plays a pivotal role in comprehending complex congenital, structural, and coronary pathology. This, in turn, contributes to safer interventions and surgical procedures. Noteworthy applications include septal defect device closure, transcatheter valvular interventions, and left atrial occlusion device implantation. The implementation of virtual reality has been shown to yield cost savings in healthcare, reduce procedure time, minimize radiation exposure, lower intravenous contrast usage, and decrease the extent of anesthesia required. These benefits collectively result in a more efficient and effective approach to patient care.

ID SELECTION
AB In this paper, we propose an application customized network slicing mechanism to cope with dynamic traffic in future networks and various service requirements for network users, namely, context-aware network slicing (CANS). The resource allocation is carried out in frequency (f), space (s) and time (t) domains (referred to as three domains (3D) resource allocation) while the customization targets at low latency and high reliability, characteristic for IoT applications. We first formulate CANS as a two-step matching game with unknown preferences for access and back-haul networks. To dynamically resize mobile users' network slices (NSs), we propose application customized CANS++ method based on a coalition game to minimize the hand-off risk in the network. We then develop two-step stable matching (TSSM) and $\epsilon$-Pareto stability techniques to find the solutions to CANS and CANS++, respectively. To improve energy and cost efficiency, an artificial intelligence-based Dynamic Network Architecture (DNA) with ON/OFF scheduling (AI-DOS) is proposed to dynamically maximize NS utilization. Finally, we carry out extensive numerical analysis and demonstrate that context-aware 3D network slicing and resizing schemes can improve at least three times the users' utilities. These utilities are enhanced up to 180% by minimizing their hand-off risk. Furthermore, NS shrinking technique can reduce the number of active nodes (controlled in the s-domain) by factor five while the average utility of macro base stations, controlled in the t-domain, is improved between 70% and 500%.

AB The development of measurement methodologies to detect and monitor nuclear-relevant materials remains a consistent and significant interest across the nuclear energy, nonproliferation, safeguards, and forensics communities. Optical spectroscopy of laser-produced plasmas is becoming an increasingly popular diagnostic technique to measure radiological and nuclear materials in the field without sample preparation, where current capabilities encompass the standoff, isotopically resolved and phase-identifiable (e.g., UO and UO2) detection of elements across the periodic table. These methods rely on the process of laser ablation (LA), where a high-powered pulsed laser is used to excite a sample (solid, liquid, or gas) into a luminous microplasma that rapidly undergoes de-excitation through the emission of electromagnetic radiation, which serves as a spectroscopic fingerprint for that sample. This review focuses on LA plasmas and spectroscopy for nuclear applications, covering topics from the wide-area environmental sampling and atmospheric sensing of radionuclides to recent implementations of multivariate machine learning methods that work to enable the real-time analysis of spectrochemical measurements with an emphasis on fundamental research and development activities over the past two decades. Background on the physical breakdown mechanisms and interactions of matter with nanosecond and ultrafast laser pulses that lead to the generation of laser-produced microplasmas is provided, followed by a description of the transient spatiotemporal plasma conditions that control the behavior of spectroscopic signatures recorded by analytical methods in atomic and molecular spectroscopy. High-temperature chemical and thermodynamic processes governing reactive LA plasmas are also examined alongside investigations into the condensation pathways of the plasma, which are believed to serve as chemical surrogates for fallout particles formed in nuclear fireballs. Laser-supported absorption waves and laser-induced shockwaves that accompany LA plasmas are also discussed, which could provide insights into atmospheric ionization phenomena from strong shocks following nuclear detonations. Furthermore, the standoff detection of trace radioactive aerosols and fission gases is reviewed in the context of monitoring atmospheric radiation plumes and off-gas streams of molten salt reactors. Finally, concluding remarks will present future outlooks on the role of LA plasma spectroscopy in the nuclear community.

AB Residents learn the vesico-urethral anastomosis (VUA), a key step in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP), early in their training. VUA assessment and training significantly impact patient outcomes and have high educational value. This study aimed to develop objective prediction models for the Robotic Anastomosis Competency Evaluation (RACE) metrics using electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye-tracking data. Data were recorded from 23 participants performing robot-assisted VUA (henceforth 'anastomosis') on plastic models and animal tissue using the da Vinci surgical robot. EEG and eye-tracking features were extracted, and participants' anastomosis subtask performance was assessed by three raters using the RACE tool and operative videos. Random forest regression (RFR) and gradient boosting regression (GBR) models were developed to predict RACE scores using extracted features, while linear mixed models (LMM) identified associations between features and RACE scores. Overall performance scores significantly differed among inexperienced, competent, and experienced skill levels (P value < 0.0001). For plastic anastomoses, R-2 values for predicting unseen test scores were: needle positioning (0.79), needle entry (0.74), needle driving and tissue trauma (0.80), suture placement (0.75), and tissue approximation (0.70). For tissue anastomoses, the values were 0.62, 0.76, 0.65, 0.68, and 0.62, respectively. The models could enhance RARP anastomosis training by offering objective performance feedback to trainees.

AB The unique relationship between dog and owner has been demonstrated in several experimental procedures, including tests in which dogs are left alone or with a stranger, tests of dogs' appeasement or social approach when petted by their owner or a stranger, and their ability to learn when taught by their owner or a stranger. In all cases, dogs responded differently to their owner, which has been referred to as a specific attachment, and likely a product of a prolonged history of reinforcement. In the current study, we used a concurrent choice paradigm in which dogs could interact with two people, both of whom provided the same petting interaction, to test whether owned dogs would prefer their owner over a stranger and whether the familiarity of the testing context would influence preference. We also investigated whether shelter and owned dogs tested with two strangers would show a preference between strangers and whether that preference would be similar in magnitude to any preference between the owner and stranger. Owned dogs preferred to interact with their owners when in an unfamiliar context, but allocated more time to the stranger in a familiar context. Both shelter and owned dogs tested with two strangers showed a magnitude of preference for one stranger over the other similar to owned dogs' preference for owners in an unfamiliar context. These results parallel what has been found in strange situation tests with owned dogs tested with their owners, but the strength of preference shown for one of two strangers indicates dogs can form a preference for one person quickly.

AB Neural networks are routinely used for nonparametric regression modeling. The interest in these models is growing with ever-increasing complexities in modern datasets. With modern technological advancements, the number of predictors frequently exceeds the sample size in many application areas. Thus, selecting important predictors from the huge pool is an extremely important task for judicious inference. This paper proposes a novel flexible class of single-layer radial basis functions (RBF) networks. The proposed architecture can estimate smooth unknown regression functions and also perform variable selection. We primarily focus on Gaussian RBF-net due to its attractive properties. The extensions to other choices of RBF are fairly straightforward. The proposed architecture is also shown to be effective in identifying relevant predictors in a low-dimensional setting using the posterior samples without imposing any sparse estimation scheme. We develop an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to generate posterior samples of the parameters. We illustrate the proposed method's empirical efficacy through simulation experiments, both in high and low dimensional regression problems. The posterior contraction rate is established with respect to empirical l2 distance assuming that the error variance is unknown, and the true function belongs to a Holder ball. We illustrate our method in a Human Connectome Project dataset to predict vocabulary comprehension and to identify important edges of the structural connectome.

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to characterize early urinary gene expression differences between patients with sepsis and patients with sterile inflammation and summarize in terms of a reproducible sepsis probability score. Design: This was a prospective observational cohort study. Setting: The study was conducted in a quaternary care academic hospital. Patients: One hundred eighty-six sepsis patients and 78 systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) patients enrolled between January 2015 and February 2018. Interventions: Whole-genome transcriptomic analysis of RNA was extracted from urine obtained from sepsis patients within 12 hours of sepsis onset and from patients with surgery-acquired SIRS within 4 hours after major inpatient surgery. Measurements and Main Results: We identified 422 of 23,956 genes (1.7%) that were differentially expressed between sepsis and SIRS patients. Differentially expressed probes were provided to a collection of machine learning feature selection models to identify focused probe sets that differentiate between sepsis and SIRS. These probe sets were combined to find an optimal probe set (UrSepsisModel) and calculate a urinary sepsis score (UrSepsisScore), which is the geometric mean of downregulated genes subtracted from the geometric mean of upregulated genes. This approach summarizes the expression values of all decisive genes as a single sepsis score. The UrSepsisModel and UrSepsisScore achieved area under the receiver operating characteristic curves 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.86-0.96) and 0.80 (95% confidence interval, 0.70-0.88) on the validation cohort, respectively. Functional analyses of probes associated with sepsis demonstrated metabolic dysregulation manifest as reduced oxidative phosphorylation, decreased amino acid metabolism, and decreased oxidation of lipids and fatty acids. Conclusions: Whole-genome transcriptomic profiling of urinary cells revealed focused probe panels that can function as an early diagnostic tool for differentiating sepsis from sterile SIRS. Functional analysis of differentially expressed genes demonstrated a distinct metabolic dysregulation signature in sepsis.

TI Toward a Kernel-Based Uncertainty Decomposition Framework for Data and
   Models
SO NEURAL COMPUTATION
LA English
DT Article
ID EQUATION
AB This letter introduces a new framework for quantifying predictive uncertainty for both data and models that relies on projecting the data into a gaussian reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and transforming the data probability density function (PDF) in a way that quantifies the flow of its gradient as a topological potential field (quantified at all points in the sample space). This enables the decomposition of the PDF gradient flow by formulating it as a moment decomposition problem using operators from quantum physics, specifically Schrodinger's formulation. We experimentally show that the higher-order moments systematically cluster the different tail regions of the PDF, thereby providing unprecedented discriminative resolution of data regions having high epistemic uncertainty. In essence, this approach decomposes local realizations of the data PDF in terms of uncertainty moments. We apply this framework as a surrogate tool for predictive uncertainty quantification of point-prediction neural network models, overcoming various limitations of conventional Bayesian-based uncertainty quantification methods. Experimental comparisons with some established methods illustrate performance advantages that our framework exhibits.

AB Neuroimaging provides for non-invasive evaluation of brain structure and activity and has been employed to suggest possible mechanisms for cognitive aging in humans. However, these imaging procedures have limits in terms of defining cellular and molecular mechanisms. In contrast, investigations of cognitive aging in animal models have mostly utilized techniques that have offered insight on synaptic, cellular, genetic, and epigenetic mechanisms affecting memory. Studies employing magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy (MRI and MRS, respectively) in animal models have emerged as an integrative set of techniques bridging localized cellular/molecular phenomenon and broader in vivo neural network alterations. MRI methods are remarkably suited to longitudinal tracking of cognitive function over extended periods permitting examination of the trajectory of structural or activity related changes. Combined with molecular and electrophysiological tools to selectively drive activity within specific brain regions, recent studies have begun to unlock the meaning of fMRI signals in terms of the role of neural plasticity and types of neural activity that generate the signals. The techniques provide a unique opportunity to causally determine how memory-relevant synaptic activity is processed and how memories may be distributed or reconsolidated over time. The present review summarizes research employing animal MRI and MRS in the study of brain function, structure, and biochemistry, with a particular focus on age-related cognitive decline.

AB In this paper we present a new technique for time series segmentation built around a fast principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm that is on-line and stable. The traditional Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test (GLRT) has been used to solve the segmentation problem, but this has enormous limitations in terms of complexity and speed. Newer methods use gated experts and mixture models to detect transitions in time series. These techniques perform better than GLRT, but most of them require extensive training of relatively large neural networks. The segmentation method discussed in this paper is based on a novel idea that involves solving the generalized eigendecomposition of two consecutive windowed time series and can be formulated as a two-step PCA. Thus, the performance of our segmentation technique mainly depends on the efficiency of the PCA algorithm. Most of the existing techniques for PCA are based on gradient search procedures that are slow and they also suffer from convergence problems. The PCA algorithm presented in this paper is both online, and is proven to converge faster than the current methods.

TI Machine-learning nonstationary noise out of gravitational-wave detectors
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
LA English
DT Article
AB Signal extraction out of background noise is a common challenge in high-precision physics experiments, where the measurement output is often a continuous data stream. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the detection, witness sensors are often used to independently measure background noises and subtract them from the main signal. If the noise coupling is linear and stationary, optimal techniques already exist and are routinely implemented in many experiments. However, when the noise coupling is nonstationary, linear techniques often fail or are suboptimal. Inspired by the properties of the background noise in gravitational wave detectors, this work develops a novel algorithm to efficiently characterize and remove nonstationary noise couplings, provided there exist witnesses of the noise source and of the modulation. In this work, the algorithm is described in its most general formulation, and its efficiency is demonstrated with examples from the data of the Advanced LIGO gravitational-wave observatory, where we could obtain an improvement of the detector gravitational-wave reach without introducing any bias on the source parameter estimation.

AB Near ground wind velocity observations and wind tunnel measurements have identified height dependent non-Gaussian behavior in longitudinal wind turbulence. The potential sensitivity of bluff body peak pressure loads to non-Gaussian turbulence motivates an investigation to modulate longitudinal skewness in the approach flow through passive mechanical turbulence generation. It is currently an open question as to whether higher-order properties of turbulence can be modulated via roughness element grid. This research leverages outcomes from a recent active machine learning experimental study to modulate turbulence profiles in a boundary layer wind tunnel using an automated roughness grid. Reynolds stress fraction analyses of turbulence data from hundreds of non-homogeneous roughness configurations are related to the observed along wind turbulence skewness profile. The results identify a relationship between roughness element configuration features and resultant skewness profiles, providing insights into modulating higher-order longitudinal turbulence behavior in boundary layer wind simulation.

AB Introduction Long-distance robot teleoperation faces high latencies that pose cognitive challenges to human operators. Latency between command, execution, and feedback in teleoperation can impair performance and affect operators' mental state. The neural underpinnings of these effects are not well understood.Methods This study aims to understand the cognitive impact of latency in teleoperation and the related mitigation methods, using functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) to analyze functional connectivity. A human subject experiment (n = 41) of a simulated remote robot manipulation task was performed. Three conditions were tested: no latency, with visual and haptic latency, with visual latency and no haptic latency. fNIRS and performance data were recorded and analyzed.Results The presence of latency in teleoperation significantly increased functional connectivity within and between prefrontal and motor cortexes. Maintaining visual latency while providing real-time haptic feedback reduced the average functional connectivity in all cortical networks and showed a significantly different connectivity ratio within prefrontal and motor cortical networks. The performance results showed the worst performance in the all-delayed condition and best performance in no latency condition, which echoes the neural activity patterns.Conclusion The study provides neurological evidence that latency in teleoperation increases cognitive load, anxiety, and challenges in motion planning and control. Real-time haptic feedback, however, positively influences neural pathways related to cognition, decision-making, and sensorimotor processes. This research can inform the design of ergonomic teleoperation systems that mitigate the effects of latency.

AB Neural data are inevitably contaminated by noise. When such noisy data are subjected to statistical analysis, misleading conclusions can be reached. Here we attempt to address this problem by applying a state-space smoothing method, based on the combined use of the Kalman filter theory and the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, to denoise two datasets of local field potentials recorded from monkeys performing a visuomotor task. For the first dataset, it was found that the analysis of the high gamma band (60-90 Hz) neural activity in the prefrontal cortex is highly susceptible to the effect of noise, and denoising leads to markedly improved results that were physiologically interpretable. For the second dataset, Granger causality between primary motor and primary somatosensory cortices was not consistent across two monkeys and the effect of noise was suspected. After denoising, the discrepancy between the two subjects was significantly reduced. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The design of echo state network (ESN) parameters relies on the selection of the maximum eigenvalue of the linearized system around zero (spectral radius). However, this procedure does not quantify in a systematic manner the performance of the ESN in terms of approximation error. This article presents a functional space approximation framework to better understand the operation of ESNs and proposes an information-theoretic metric, the average entropy of echo states, to assess the richness of the ESN dynamics. Furthermore, it provides an interpretation of the ESN dynamics rooted in system theory as families of coupled linearized systems whose poles move according to the input signal dynamics. With this interpretation, a design methodology for functional approximation is put forward where ESNs are designed with uniform pole distributions covering the frequency spectrum to abide by the richness metric, irrespective of the spectral radius. A single bias parameter at the ESN input, adapted with the modeling error, configures the ESN spectral radius to the input-output joint space. Function approximation examples compare the proposed design methodology versus the conventional design.

AB This correspondence introduces a new approach to characterize textures at multiple scales. The performance of wavelet packet spaces are measured in terms of sensitivity and selectivity for the classification of twenty-five natural textures. Both energy and entropy metrics were computed for each wavelet packet and incorporated into distinct scale space representations, where each wavelet packet (channel) reflected a specific scale and orientation sensitivity. Wavelet packet representations for twenty-five natural textures were classified without error by a simple two-layer network classifier. An analyzing function of large regularity (D20) was shown to be slightly more efficient in representation and discrimination than a similar function with fewer vanishing moments (D6). In addition, energy representations computed from the standard wavelet decomposition alone (17 features) provided classification without error for the twenty-five textures included in our study. The reliability exhibited by texture signatures based on wavelet packets analysis suggest that the multiresolution properties of such transforms are beneficial for accomplishing segmentation, classification and subtle discrimination of texture.

AB A printed circuit board (PCB) provides necessary mechanical support to an electronic system and acts as a platform for connecting electronic components. Counterfeiting and in-field tampering of PCBs have become significant security concerns in the semiconductor industry as a result of increasing untrusted entities in the supply chain. These counterfeit components may result in performance degradation, profit reduction, and reputation risk for the manufacturers. While Integrated Circuit (IC) level authentication using physical unclonable functions (PUFs) has been widely investigated, countermeasures at the PCB level are scarce. These approaches either suffer fromsignificant overhead issues, or opportunistic counterfeiters can breach them like clockwork. Besides, they cannot be extended to system-level (both chip and PCB together), and their applications are also limited to a specific purpose (i.e., either counterfeiting or tampering). In this article, we introduce SILVerIn, a novel systematic approach to verify the authenticity of all chips used in a PCB aswell as the board for combating attacks such as counterfeiting, cloning, and in-field malicious modifications. We develop this approach by utilizing the existing boundary scan architecture (BSA) of modern ICs and PCBs. As a result, its implementation comes at a negligible (similar to 0.5%) hardware overhead. SILVerIn is integrated into a PCB design during the manufacturing phase. We implement our technique on a custom hardware platform consisting of an FPGA and a microcontroller. We incorporate the industry-standard JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) interface to transmit test data into the BSA and perform hands-on measurement of supply current at both chip and PCB levels on 20 boards. We reconstruct these current values to digital signatures that exhibit high uniqueness, robustness, and randomness features. Our approach manifests strong reproducibility of signatures at different supply voltage levels, even with a low-resolution measurement setup. SILVerIn also demonstrates a high resilience against machine learning-based modeling attacks, with an average prediction accuracy of similar to 51%. Finally, we conduct intentional alteration experiments by replacing the on-board FPGA to replicate the scenario of PCB tampering, and the results indicate successful detection of in-field modifications in a PCB.

AB Background: The influence of Parkinson's disease (PD) as well as deep brain stimulation (DBS) on visual-artistic production of people who have been artists is unclear. We systematically assessed the artistic-creative productions of a patient with PD who was referred to us for management of a left subthalamic region (STN) DBS. The patient was an artist before her disease started, permitting us to analyze changes in her artistic-creative production over the course of the illness and during her treatment with DBS.
   Methods: We collected her paintings from four time periods: Time 1 (Early Pre-Presymptomatic), Time 2 (Later Presymptomatic), Time 3 (Symptomatic), and Time 4 (DBS Symptomatic). A total of 59 paintings were submitted to a panel of judges, who rated the paintings on 6 different artistic qualities including: aesthetics, closure, evocative impact, novelty, representation, technique.
   Results: Aesthetics and evocative impact significantly declined from Time 2 to Time 4. Representation and technique indicated a curvilinear relationship, with initial improvement from Time 1 to Time 2 followed by a decline from Time 2 to Time 4.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that left STN/SNR-DBS impacted artistic performances in our patient. The reason for these alterations is not known, but it might be that alterations of left hemisphere functions induce a hemispheric bias reducing the influence the right hemisphere which is important for artistic creativity. The left hemisphere itself plays a critical role in artistic creativity and DBS might have altered left hemisphere functions or altered the mesolimbic system which might have also influenced creativity. Future studies will be required to learn how PD and DBS influence creativity. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB IntroductionThis study aims to explore machine learning (ML) methods for early prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD) using the real-world electronic health records (EHRs). MethodsA total of 23,835 ADRD and 1,038,643 control patients were identified from the OneFlorida+ Research Consortium. Two ML methods were used to develop the prediction models. Both knowledge-driven and data-driven approaches were explored. Four computable phenotyping algorithms were tested. ResultsThe gradient boosting tree (GBT) models trained with the data-driven approach achieved the best area under the curve (AUC) scores of 0.939, 0.906, 0.884, and 0.854 for early prediction of ADRD 0, 1, 3, or 5 years before diagnosis, respectively. A number of important clinical and sociodemographic factors were identified. DiscussionWe tested various settings and showed the predictive ability of using ML approaches for early prediction of ADRD with EHRs. The models can help identify high-risk individuals for early informed preventive or prognostic clinical decisions.

AB BackgroundResearch on health and sustainable development is growing at a pace such that conventional literature review methods appear increasingly unable to synthesize all relevant evidence. This paper employs a novel combination of natural language processing (NLP) and network science techniques to address this problem and to answer two questions: (1) how is health thematically interconnected with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in global science? (2) What specific themes have emerged in research at the intersection between SDG 3 ("Good health and well-being") and other sustainability goals?MethodsAfter a descriptive analysis of the integration between SDGs in twenty years of global science (2001-2020) as indexed by dimensions.ai, we analyze abstracts of articles that are simultaneously relevant to SDG 3 and at least one other SDG (N = 27,928). We use the top2vec algorithm to discover topics in this corpus and measure semantic closeness between these topics. We then use network science methods to describe the network of substantive relationships between the topics and identify 'zipper themes', actionable domains of research and policy to co-advance health and other sustainability goals simultaneously.ResultsWe observe a clear increase in scientific research integrating SDG 3 and other SDGs since 2001, both in absolute and relative terms, especially on topics relevant to interconnections between health and SDGs 2 ("Zero hunger"), 4 ("Quality education"), and 11 ("Sustainable cities and communities"). We distill a network of 197 topics from literature on health and sustainable development, with 19 distinct network communities - areas of growing integration with potential to further bridge health and sustainability science and policy. Literature focused explicitly on the SDGs is highly central in this network, while topical overlaps between SDG 3 and the environmental SDGs (12-15) are under-developed.ConclusionOur analysis demonstrates the feasibility and promise of NLP and network science for synthesizing large amounts of health-related scientific literature and for suggesting novel research and policy domains to co-advance multiple SDGs. Many of the 'zipper themes' identified by our method resonate with the One Health perspective that human, animal, and plant health are closely interdependent. This and similar perspectives will help meet the challenge of 'rewiring' sustainability research to co-advance goals in health and sustainability.

AB Citrus Black Spot (CBS) causes considerable damage to the Florida citrus industry. Early detection of CBS, especially in the presence of other peel blemishes, would enable better mapping and control of CBS spread, reduce wasted fruit, and permit early removal of culls from the packing stream. Oranges whose peels bore the symptoms of four defects/disease (CBS, greasy spot, melanose, and wind scar), as well as a normal control group, were imaged with a hyperspectral imaging system. Principal Component Analysis- (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) -based methods were employed to select bands from these images, and a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) for feature extraction was trained with these bands. The extracted features permitted classification of the peel conditions with four classifiers: SoftMax, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). A mean overall accuracy of 94.9 % was achieved using an SVM classifier on five bands selected with PCA, and 90.2 % with LDA-selected bands. These results show the potential of CNNs to extract features for automated postharvest citrus inspection.

TI RVIP: an indistinguishable approach to scalable network simulation at
   real time
SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
LA English
DT Article
DE hybrid network simulation; virtual protocol stack; no topological
   constraint; zero live node change
AB In the hybrid simulation research, we investigate a new approach to build software virtual networks (SVNs) that are indistinguishable from their equivalent real live networks (LNs). We define the concept of 'Network's Interactive Turing Test' based on the similar concept used in the artificial intelligence areas. Our goal is to actualize the interactive and indistinguishable real-virtual interface pair (RVIP) for large-scale computer network simulations. By RVIP's support, a single SVN is indistinguishable from its equivalent LN. In the entire hybrid system, multiple LNs and multiple SVNs are connected using many RVIPs in an arbitrary topology and at real time. To actualize RVIP, the following necessary conditions must be satisfied: (i) the performance of the underlying simulation platform must be faster than real time; (ii) all needed changes incurred by introducing any SVN into an LN scenario are put on the simulation's side. To interact with an SVN, RVIP requires that no change is made on any live node; (iii) an SVN does not exchange simulation events with LNs, that is, only standard IP protocol interactions between SVN and LN are allowed. (iv) Any LN can be dynamically plugged into the hybrid scenario at real time, just like being plugged into an equivalent purely LN. Compared with existing hybrid simulation efforts on NS-3, QualNet's EXata and OPNET's system-in-the-loop, in this paper, we use the actual RVIP implementation to show that RVIP is a better candidate to pass the Network's Interactive Turing Test owing to the following two advantages: (i) an interactive network tester can easily distinguish the existing hybrid networks from the LNs by using a live topology that cannot be simulated, for example, by including the entire live Internet. But RVIP is not vulnerable to such tests. RVIP can support hybrid scenarios with multiple SVNs and multiple LNs connected by an arbitrary network topology, and with the LNs on and off at anytime. (ii) Performance-wise, our studies show that RVIP provides more efficient support in terms of common metrics such as larger throughput limit and smaller extra latency; thus, the simulated SVNs are more indistinguishable from their live counterparts.

ID CARBON-DIOXIDE
AB The effect of energy degradation (Degradation is the creation of net entropy resulting from irreversibility.) accompanying pressure drops across chromatographic columns is examined with regard to explaining axial temperature gradients in both high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC). The observed effects of warming and cooling can be explained equally well in the language of thermodynamics or fluid dynamics. The necessary equivalence of these treatments is reviewed here to show the legitimacy of using whichever one supports the simpler determination of features of interest. The determination of temperature profiles in columns by direct application of the laws of thermodynamics is somewhat simpler than applying them indirectly by solving the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations. Both disciplines show that the preferred strategy for minimizing the reduction in peak quality caused by temperature gradients is to operate columns as nearly adiabatically as possible (i.e. as Joule-Thomson expansions). This useful fact, however, is not widely familiar or appreciated in the chromatography community due to some misunderstanding of the meaning of certain terms and expressions used in these disciplines. In fluid dynamics, the terms "resistive heating" or "frictional heating" have been widely used as synonyms for the dissipation function, 0, in the NS energy equation. These terms have been widely used by chromatographers as well, but often misinterpreted as due to friction between the mobile phase and the column packing, when in fact 0 describes the increase in entropy of the system (dissipation, integral TdS(univ) > 0) due to the irreversible decompression of the mobile phase. Two distinctly different contributions to the irreversibility are identified; (1) Delta S-ext, viscous dissipation of work done by the external surroundings driving the flow (the pump) contributing to its warming, and (2) Delta S-int, entropy change accompanying decompression of fluid in the column, contributing either to warming or cooling depending on local density and temperature. The molecular basis for this variation is described. Sample calculations of dissipation and temperature profiles of several model fluids including carbon dioxide-methanol mixtures are presented, based on the NIST REFPROP program including select equations of state and property calculation software.

AB Urban environments, characterized by bustling mass transit systems and high population density, host a complex web of microorganisms that impact microbial interactions. These urban microbiomes, influenced by diverse demographics and constant human movement, are vital for understanding microbial dynamics. We explore urban metagenomics, utilizing an extensive dataset from the Metagenomics & Metadesign of Subways & Urban Biomes (MetaSUB) consortium, and investigate antimicrobial resistance (AMR) patterns. In this pioneering research, we delve into the role of bacteriophages, or "phages"-viruses that prey on bacteria and can facilitate the exchange of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) through mechanisms like horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Despite their potential significance, existing literature lacks a consensus on their significance in ARG dissemination. We argue that they are an important consideration. We uncover that environmental variables, such as those on climate, demographics, and landscape, can obscure phage-resistome relationships. We adjust for these potential confounders and clarify these relationships across specific and overall antibiotic classes with precision, identifying several key phages. Leveraging machine learning tools and validating findings through clinical literature, we uncover novel associations, adding valuable insights to our comprehension of AMR development.

AB Forest landscape restoration (FLR) commitments have been established in the past years to restore over 200 million hectares, as part of the global Bonn Challenge goal, mostly through the implementation of several different restorative practices in degraded lands, ranging from com-mercial tree monocultures to restoration plantings. The potential of such contrasting restorative practices to support biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services provision vary over space and time, making the monitoring of FLR programs an emerging challenge. Remote sensing techniques, together with innovative technologies for data acquisition, treatment, and analysis have proven to be strategic for planning and monitoring FLR, yet there are still important un-resolved questions. Here, we evaluated the potential of multispectral orbital images of the high spatial (5 m) and spectral (12 bands) resolution VEN mu S microsatellite, joint project of the Israeli Space Agency and CNES, to classify the spectral behavior and diversity of six tree cover classes (savanna woodlands, old-and second-growth semi-deciduous forests, young restoration plant-ings, and eucalyptus and pine tree monocultures) commonly found in FLR programs in tropical regions. We assessed how these tree cover classes located in a study landscape in southeastern Brazil differ according to their spectral response (winter and summer bands, and vegetation indices), canopy variability (textural features), seasonal behavior (delta layers -difference be-tween summer and winter vegetation indexes), and spectral diversity, and used these attributes as variables to the model. We used the Random Forest algorithm to generate the models and evaluate how the tree cover classes differ in the classification and how the variables supported the model. We achieved high values of global accuracy (91.9%) and "F1 score" (above 0.8) for all tree cover classes, in which second-growth forest presented the lowest accuracy. The textural layers, delta layers, and the spectral diversity layers were the most important attributes to discriminate among tree cover classes. We demonstrate here the potential of using VEN mu S or similar sensor images together with different image processing and machine learning algorithms to monitor FLR programs, allowing further remote sensing approaches and in-deep field assessments to advance evaluation of FLR benefits for nature and people. We demonstrated how the fusion of all these types of data and innovative approaches to data processing, can result in novel ways to assess restoration performance and open new avenues to upscale monitoring, bridging the gap between FLR expectations and achieved goals.

AB Historical vegetation data are important to ecological studies, as many structuring processes operate at long time scales, from decades to centuries. Capturing the pattern of variability within a system (enough to declare a significant change from past to present) relies on correct assumptions about the temporal scale of the processes involved. Sufficient long-term data are often lacking, and current techniques have their weaknesses. To address this concern, we constructed multistate and artificial neural network models (ANN) to provide fore- and hindcast vegetation communities considered critical foraging habitat for an endangered bird, the Florida Snail Kite (Rostrhamus sociabilis). Multistate models were not able to hindcast due to our data not satisfying a detailed balance requirement for time reversibility in Markovian dynamics. Multistate models were useful for forecasting and providing environmental variables for the ANN. Results from our ANN hindcast closely mirrored the population collapse of the Snail Kite population using only environmental data to inform the model. The parallel between the two gives us confidence in the hindcasting results and their use in future demographic models.

AB This study applies computationally efficient shallow neural networks to predict topographic effect multipliers directly from digital elevation data obtained from complex terrain, such as mountainous areas. Data were obtained from boundary layer wind tunnel (BLWT) modeling of surface wind flow over six regions in mainland Puerto Rico and its municipal islands. The results demonstrate an improvement over linear regression models, even for computationally efficient low neuron count and single hidden layer models. The paper proposes the development of a global BLWT data atlas to inform development of methods to predict topographic wind speedup for a diverse range of topography and surface roughness conditions. It also identifies knowledge gaps that could prevent standardization of data collected from different BLWT experimental designs.

AB Ultrasound (US) use has rapidly entered the field of acute pain medicine and regional anesthesia and interventional pain medicine over the last decade, and it may even become the standard of practice. The advantages of US guidance over conventional techniques include the ability to both view the targeted structure and visualize, in real time, the distribution of the injected medication, and the capacity to control its distribution by readjusting the needle position, if needed. US guidance should plausibly improve the success rate of the procedures, their safety and speed. This article provides basic information on musculoskeletal US techniques, with an emphasis on the principles and practical aspects. We stress that for the best use of US, one should venture beyond the "pattern recognition" mode to the more advanced systematic approach and use US as a tool to visualize structures beyond the skin (sonoanatomy mode). We discuss the sonographic appearance of different tissues, introduce the reader to commonly used US-related terminology, cover basic machine "knobology" and fundamentals of US probe selection and manipulation. At the end, we discuss US-guided needle advancement. We only briefly touch on topics dealing with physics, artifacts, or sonopathology, which are available elsewhere in the medical literature.

AB The translocation of clay sized particles is an extensive soil process that occurs in over half of the total surface area covered by soil globally. However, investigations into lessivage are usually limited in extent and scale, and results from experimental data do not reflect natural conditions since control is exerted on various soil properties, such as particle size distributions, and clay mineralogy. Using the NCSS Soil Characterization Database and the USDA Soil Taxonomy definition for an argillic horizon, a random forest machine learning approach was used to investigate lessivage in Florida soils. Within the database, 395 soil profiles observed and described in Florida were identified to have an argillic horizon and lack the presence of a lithologic discontinuity. The coefficient of determination (R2), and the root mean square error (RMSE) were used to estimate the performance of the random forest model. The validation results showed that the model for the depth of lessivage achieved an R2 of 0.59 f 0.07 and an RMSE of 27.86 f 2.62 cm and the model for the degree of lessivage achieved an R2 of 0.68 f 0.14 and an RMSE of 5.91 f 3.25. A variable importance analysis indicated that the concentration of OC, the CEC, and the total extractable bases in the eluvial zone were the dominant soil properties in predicting the depth of the argillic horizon. The response in the predicted depth to the argillic horizon was similar with each of the aforementioned correlated variables and indicative of the flocculating mechanism, whereby polyvalent cations anchor OM to particle surfaces which then enables particle bridging. Whereas, extractable acidity in the eluvial zone and sand concentration in the illuvial zone were the dominant soil properties in predicting the degree of lessivage. As extractable acidity in the eluvial zone increased, the degree of lessivage decreased which could be indicative of coagulation due to an increase in the activity of Al3+ and H+ ions. Another mechanism identified in clay immobilization in this study is the cessation of the wetting front as a result of the loss of energy. As the depth to gleying increased, the predicted depth to the argillic horizon increased and the degree of lessivage increased. However, based on the variable importance analysis, this mechanism was not determined to be dominant in Florida soils.

AB In vivo therapeutic gene transfer has emerged as a novel class of medicines. Its feasibility relies on the safe and efficacious delivery of genetic cargo to the appropriate targets. The adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector manifested itself as a preferred gene delivery vehicle enabling therapeutic gene expression for several clinical indications. Here, we cover the recent trends in AAV capsid engineering to enhance its targeting specificity, safety, and endurance. While each and every desirable trait can be individually remodeled, combining several attributes in one capsid amounts to a significant engineering challenge. Taking advantage of virion structure and phylogenetics, harnessing directed evolution, sequence analyses, and machine learning, researchers develop novel capsid variants to realize the goals of safe and enduring gene therapy.

   Histopathology image classification
AB Although convolutional neural networks have achieved tremendous success on histopathology image classification, they usually require large-scale clean annotated data and are sensitive to noisy labels. Unfortunately, labeling large-scale images is laborious, expensive and lowly reliable for pathologists. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel self-ensembling based deep architecture to leverage the semantic information of annotated images and explore the information hidden in unlabeled data, and meanwhile being robust to noisy labels. Specifically, the proposed architecture first creates ensemble targets for feature and label predictions of training samples, by using exponential moving average (EMA) to aggregate feature and label predictions within multiple previous training epochs. Then, the ensemble targets within the same class are mapped into a cluster so that they are further enhanced. Next, a consistency cost is utilized to form consensus predictions under different configurations. Finally, we validate the proposed method with extensive experiments on lung and breast cancer datasets that contain thousands of images. It can achieve 90.5% and 89.5% image classification accuracy using only 20% labeled patients on the two datasets, respectively. This performance is comparable to that of the baseline method with all labeled patients. Experiments also demonstrate its robustness to small percentage of noisy labels. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI Child-adult speech diarization in naturalistic conditions of preschool
   classrooms using room-independent ResNet model and automatic speech
   recognition-based re-segmentation
SO JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
LA English
DT Article
AB Speech and language development are early indicators of overall analytical and learning ability in children. The preschool classroom is a rich language environment for monitoring and ensuring growth in young children by measuring their vocal interactions with teachers and classmates. Early childhood researchers are naturally interested in analyzing naturalistic vs controlled lab recordings to measure both quality and quantity of such interactions. Unfortunately, present-day speech technologies are not capable of addressing the wide dynamic scenario of early childhood classroom settings. Due to the diversity of acoustic events/conditions in such daylong audio streams, automated speaker diarization technology would need to be advanced to address this challenging domain for segmenting audio as well as information extraction. This study investigates alternate deep learning-based lightweight, knowledge-distilled, diarization solutions for segmenting classroom interactions of 3-5 years old children with teachers. In this context, the focus on speech-type diarization which classifies speech segments as being either from adults or children partitioned across multiple classrooms. Our lightest CNN model achieves a best F1-score of similar to 76.0% on data from two classrooms, based on dev and test sets of each classroom. It is utilized with automatic speech recognition-based re-segmentation modules to perform child-adult diarization. Additionally, F1-scores are obtained for individual segments with corresponding speaker tags (e.g., adult vs child), which provide knowledge for educators on child engagement through naturalistic communications. The study demonstrates the prospects of addressing educational assessment needs through communication audio stream analysis, while maintaining both security and privacy of all children and adults. The resulting child communication metrics have been used for broad-based feedback for teachers with the help of visualizations.

AB To maximize the transmitted power available in active sensing, the probing waveform should be of constant modulus. On the other hand, in order to adapt to the increasingly crowed radio frequency spectrum and prevent mutual interferences, there are also requirements in the waveform spectral shape. That is to say, the waveform must fulfill constraints in both time and frequency domains. In this work, designing these waveforms is formulated as a nonlinear constrained optimization problem. By introducing auxiliary variable neurons and Lagrange neurons, we solve it using the Lagrange programming neural network. We also analyze the local stability conditions of the dynamic neuron model. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm is a competitive alternative for waveform design with unit modulus and arbitrary spectral shapes.

AB The purpose of this study is to examine the use of multi-resolution object-based classification methods for the classification of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) images of wetland vegetation and to compare its performance with pixel-based classification approaches. Three types of classifiers (Support Vector Machine, Artificial Neural Network and Maximum Likelihood) were utilized to classify the object-based images, the original 8-cm UAS images and the down-sampled (30 cm) version of the image. The results of the object-based and two pixel-based classifications were evaluated and compared. Object-based classification produced higher accuracy than pixel-based classifications if the same type of classifier is used. Our results also showed that under the same classification scheme (i.e. object or pixel), the Support Vector Machine classifier performed slightly better than Artificial Neural Network, which often yielded better results than Maximum Likelihood. With an overall accuracy of 70.78%, object-based classification using Support Vector Machine showed the best performance. This study also concludes that while UAS has the potential to provide flexible and feasible solutions for wetland mapping, some issues related to image quality still need to be addressed in order to improve the classification performance.

AB Insects that feed by ingesting plant and animal fluids cause devastating damage to humans, livestock, and agriculture worldwide, primarily by transmitting pathogens of plants and animals. The feeding processes required for successful pathogen transmission by sucking insects can be recorded by monitoring voltage changes across an insect-food source feeding circuit. The output from such monitoring has traditionally been examined manually, a slow and onerous process. We taught a computer program to automatically classify previously described insect feeding patterns involved in transmission of the pathogen causing citrus greening disease. We also show how such analysis contributes to discovery of previously unrecognized feeding states and can be used to characterize plant resistance mechanisms. This advance greatly reduces the time and effort required to analyze insect feeding, and should facilitate developing, screening, and testing of novel intervention strategies to disrupt pathogen transmission affecting agriculture, livestock and human health.

AB Training multilayer neural networks is typically carried out using descent techniques such as the gradient-based backpropagation (BP) of error or the quasi-Newton approaches including the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm. This is basically due to the fact that there are no analytical methods to find the optimal weights, so iterative local or global optimization techniques are necessary. The success of iterative optimization procedures is strictly dependent on the initial conditions, therefore, in this paper, we devise a principled novel method of backpropagating the desired response through the layers of a multilayer perceptron (MLP), which enables us to accurately initialize these neural networks in,the minimum mean-square-error sense, using the analytic linear least squares solution. The generated solution can be used as an initial condition to standard iterative optimization algorithms. However, simulations demonstrate that in most cases, the performance achieved through the proposed initialization scheme leaves little room for further improvement in the mean-square-error (MSE) over the training set. In addition, the performance of the network optimized with the proposed approach also generalizes well to testing data. A rigorous derivation of the initialization algorithm is presented and its high performance is verified with a number of benchmark training problems including chaotic time-series prediction, classification, and nonlinear system identification with MLPs.

AB Large Igneous Province (LIP) eruptions are thought to have driven environmental and climate change over wide temporal scales ranging from a few to thousands of years. Since the radiative effects and atmospheric lifetime of carbon dioxide (CO2, warming) and sulfur dioxide (SO2, cooling) are very different, the conventional assumption has been to analyze the effects of CO2 and SO2 emissions separately and add them together afterward. In this study, we test this assumption by analyzing the joint effect of CO2 and SO2 on the marine carbonate cycle using a biogeochemical carbon cycle box model (Long-term Ocean-atmosphere-Sediment CArbon cycle Reservoir Model). By performing model runs with very fine temporal resolution (similar to 0.1-year timestep), we analyze the effects of LIP carbon and sulfur gas emissions on timescales ranging from an individual eruption (hundreds to thousands of years) to the entire long-term carbon cycle (>100,000 years). We find that, contrary to previous work, sulfur emissions have significant long-term (>1,000 years) effects on the marine carbon cycle (dissolved inorganic carbon, pH, alkalinity, and carbonate compensation depth). This is due to two processes: the strongly temperature-dependent equilibrium coefficients for marine carbonate chemistry and the few thousand-year timescale for ocean overturning circulation. Thus, the effects of volcanic sulfur are not simply additive to the impact of carbon emissions. We develop a causal mechanistic framework to visualize the feedbacks associated with combined carbon and sulfur emissions and the associated timescales. Our results provide a new perspective for understanding the complex feedback mechanisms controlling the environmental effects of large volcanic eruptions over Earth history. Plain Language Summary Large Igneous Province (LIP) eruptions are among the largest volcanic events in Earth history and have been linked with environmental catastrophes such as mass extinctions and oceanic anoxic events. One of the main ways these volcanic events affect the environment is through the emission of climate-active gases, primarily carbon dioxide (CO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2). These gases are often thought of as behaving independently, as CO2 causes long-term climate warming, while SO2, which turns into sulfate aerosols, causes short-term climate cooling. However, in addition to directly causing climate change, both gases also cause more complex environmental changes, including changes to the ocean carbon cycle (e.g., ocean acidification and the amount and chemical species of dissolved carbon). Our study uses a long-term marine carbon cycle box model to investigate these complex effects. We find that the assumption that the effects of each type of gas are independent is not accurate. Instead, we show that the carbon-cycle effects of sulfur emissions, in particular, can persist on long timescales (>1,000 years) in addition to short-term cooling. Our results provide a new perspective for understanding the environmental effects of large volcanic eruptions over Earth history.

AB Background In suspected myocardial infarction (MI), guidelines recommend using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin (hscTn)- based approaches. These require fixed assay-specific thresholds and timepoints, without directly integrating clinical information. Using machine-learning techniques including hs-cTn and clinical routine variables, we aimed to build a digital tool to directly estimate the individual probability of MI, allowing for numerous hs-cTn assays.
   Methods In 2,575 patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected MI, two ensembles of machine-learning models using single or serial concentrations of six different hs-cTn assays were derived to estimate the individual MI probability ( ARTEMIS model). Discriminative performance of the models was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and logLoss. Model performance was validated in an external cohort with 1688 patients and tested for global generalizability in 13 international cohorts with 23,411 patients.
   Results Eleven routinely available variables including age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, electrocardiography, and hs-cTn were included in the ARTEMIS models. In the validation and generalization cohorts, excellent discriminative performance was confirmed, superior to hs-cTn only. For the serial hs-cTn measurement model, AUC ranged from 0.92 to 0.98. Good calibration was observed. Using a single hs-cTn measurement, the ARTEMIS model allowed direct rule-out of MI with very high and similar safety but up to tripled efficiency compared to the guideline- recommended strategy.
   Conclusion We developed and validated diagnostic models to accurately estimate the individual probability of MI, which allow for variable hs-cTn use and flexible timing of resampling. Their digital application may provide rapid, safe and efficient personalized patient care.

AB Recently, the conventional criterion of "one-size-fits-all" is not qualified for each individual patient, requiring precision medicine for enhanced therapeutic effects. Besides, drug screening is a high-cost and time-consuming process which requires innovative approaches to facilitate drug development rate. Benefiting from consistent technical advances in 3D bioprinting techniques, droplet-based 3D bioprinting techniques have been broadly utilized in pharmaceutics due to the noncontact printing mechanism and precise control on the deposition position of droplets. More specifically, cell-free/cell-laden bioinks which are deposited for the fabrication of drug carriers/3D tissue constructs have been broadly utilized for precise drug delivery and high throughput drug screening, respectively. This review summarizes the mechanism of various droplet-based 3D bioprinting techniques and the most up-to-date applications in drug delivery and screening and discusses the potential improvements of droplet-based 3D bioprinting techniques from both technical and material aspects. Through technical innovations, materials development, and the assistance from artificial intelligence, the formation process of drug carriers will be more stable and accurately controlled guaranteeing precise drug delivery. Meanwhile, the shape fidelity and uniformity of the printed tissue models will be significantly improved ensuring drug screening efficiency and efficacy.

AB Previously. we demonstrated that placebo analgesia (PA) accompanies reductions in neural activity during painful stimulation. This study investigated areas of the brain where the neural activity was increased during PA. The literature has associated PA with two potential mechanisms of action; one sustained (e.g., engaged for the duration of PA), the other, transitory (e.g., a feedback mechanism). We propose that PA results from the engagement of two complementary pain-modulation mechanisms that are identified with fMRI data as a main effect for condition or a time * condition interaction. The mechanism with Sustained activity should activate the emotional regulation circuitry needed for memory formation of the event. The mechanism with transient activity Should process cognitive and evaluative information of the stimuli in the context o the placebo Suggestion to confirm the expectations set by it. To identify regions involved with these mechanisms, we re-analyzed fMRI data from two conditions: baseline (B) and PA. Results support the presence of both mechanisms, identified its two neural-networks with different temporal characteristics. Regions with sustained activity primarily involved the temporal and parahippocampal cortices. Conversely, brain regions with transient activity included linguistic centers in the left hemisphere and frontal regions of the right hemisphere generally associated with executive functioning. Together, these mechanisms likely engage analgesic processes and then simply monitor the system for unexpected stimuli, effectively liberating resources for other processes. Identifying brain regions associated with pain-modulation with different temporal profiles is consistent with the multidimesionality of PA and highlights the need for continued investigation of this construct.

AB Researchers have investigated whether machine learning (ML) may be able to resolve one of the most fundamental concerns in personnel selection, which is by helping reduce the subgroup differences (and resulting adverse impact) by race and gender in selection procedure scores. This article presents three such investigations. The findings show that the growing practice of making statistical adjustments to (nonlinear) ML algorithms to reduce subgroup differences must create predictive bias (differential prediction) as a mathematical certainty. This may reduce validity and inadvertently penalize high-scoring racial minorities. Similarly, one approach that adjusts the ML input data only slightly reduces the subgroup differences but at the cost of slightly reduced model accuracy. Other emerging tactics involve weighting predictors to balance or find a compromise between the competing goals of reducing subgroup differences while maintaining validity, but they have been limited to two outcomes. The third investigation extends this to three outcomes (e.g., validity, subgroup differences, and cost) and presents an online tool. Collectively, the studies in this article illustrate that ML is unlikely to be able to resolve the issue of adverse impact, but it may assist in finding incremental improvements.

AB Globally, about 17% individuals are suffering from the maladaptive procrastination until now, which impacts individual's financial status, mental health, and even public policy. However, the comprehensive understanding of neuroanatomical understructure of procrastination still remains gap. 688 participants including 3 independent samples were recruited for this study. Brain morphological dynamics referred to the idiosyncrasies of both brain size and brain shape. Multilinear regression analysis was utilized to delineate brain morphological dynamics of procrastination in Sample 1. In the Sample 2, cross-validation was yielded. Finally, prediction models of machine learning were conducted in Sample 3. Procrastination had a significantly positive correlation with the gray matter volume (GMV) in the left insula, anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC), and parahippocampal gyrus (PHC) but was negatively correlated with GMV of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and gray matter density of ACC. Furthermore, procrastination was positively correlated to the cortical thickness and cortical complexity of bilateral orbital frontal cortex (OFC). In Sample 2, all the results were cross-validated highly. Predication analysis demonstrated that these brain morphological dynamic can predict procrastination with high accuracy. This study ascertained the brain morphological dynamics involving in self-control, emotion, and episodic prospection brain network for procrastination, which advanced promising aspects of the biomarkers for it.

AB Classifying images using supervised machine learning (ML) relies on labeled training data-classes or text descriptions, for example, associated with each image. Data-driven models are only as good as the data used for training, and this points to the importance of high-quality labeled data for developing a ML model that has predictive skill. Labeling data is typically a time-consuming, manual process. Here, we investigate the process of labeling data, with a specific focus on coastal aerial imagery captured in the wake of hurricanes that affected the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of the United States. The imagery data set is a rich observational record of storm impacts and coastal change, but the imagery requires labeling to render that information accessible. We created an online interface that served labelers a stream of images and a fixed set of questions. A total of 1,600 images were labeled by at least two or as many as seven coastal scientists. We used the resulting data set to investigate interrater agreement: the extent to which labelers labeled each image similarly. Interrater agreement scores, assessed with percent agreement and Krippendorff's alpha, are higher when the questions posed to labelers are relatively simple, when the labelers are provided with a user manual, and when images are smaller. Experiments in interrater agreement point toward the benefit of multiple labelers for understanding the uncertainty in labeling data for machine learning research.
   Plain Language Summary After hurricanes and storms, pictures taken from a plane can be used to observe how the coast was impacted. A single flight might take thousands of pictures. If a computer could automatically analyze the pictures, then a person would not need to look at them one-byone. To teach a computer to analyze images, we need many pictures and many labels that describe what is visible in each picture. But where do we get those labels? Typically, a coastal scientist labels the pictures by sorting them into folders or typing codes into a spreadsheet. But does every coastal scientist label pictures the same way? Some labeling questions are easy to answer, and scientists mostly agree ("Is this image all water?"). Other labeling questions are harder to answer, and cause disagreement ("Was there damage to buildings?"). This paper is about how well scientists agree when labeling the same pictures, and how we can improve agreement among scientists. We try some experiments and offer a few ideas on how to improve agreement. We suggest writing very clear questions, using smaller images, and having a comprehensive manual. It turns out that having a manual with examples-and reading the manual!really helps.

ID NATURAL-CONVECTION; SQUARE CAVITY; AIR
AB Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are an emerging technology that can be used both in place of and in conjunction with conventional simulation methods. In this paper, we used PINNs to perform a forward simulation without leveraging known data. Our simulation was of a 2D natural convection-driven cavity using the vorticity-stream function formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations. We used both 2D simulations across the x and z domains at constant Rayleigh (Ra) numbers and 3D simulations across the x, z and Ra domains. The 3D simulation was tested for a PINN's ability to learn solutions in a higher-dimensional space than standard simulations. The results were validated against published solutions at Ra values of 103\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$<^>{3}$$\end{document}, 104\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$<^>{4}$$\end{document}, 105\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$<^>{5}$$\end{document}, and 106\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$<^>{6}$$\end{document}. Both the 2D simulations and 3D simulations successfully matched the expected results. For the 2D cases, more training iterations were needed for the model to converge at higher Ra values (105\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$<^>5$$\end{document} and 106\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$<^>6$$\end{document}) than at lower Ra (103\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$<^>3$$\end{document} and 104\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$<^>4$$\end{document}) indicating increased nonlinear fluid-thermal coupling. The 3D case was also able to converge but, but it required more training than any of the 2D cases due to the curse of dimensionality. These results showed the validity of standard simulations via PINNs and the feasibility of higher-order parameter space solutions that are not possible using conventional methods. They also showcased the additional computational demand associated with increasing the dimensionality of the learned parameter space.

AB Botulinum toxin (BoNT) is a potent neurotoxin produced by toxigenic strains of Clostridium botulinum Botulimun toxin poses a major threat since It could be employed In a deliberate attack on the U.S. food supply. Furthermore, BoNT may be liberated in any Insufficiently processed food containing a reduced oxygen atmosphere. Hence, rapid and reliable detection of BoNT in foods Is necessary to reduce risks posed through food contamination. We present a BoNT biosensor employing living neural cultures grown in vitro on microelectrode arrays (MEAs). An MEA is a culture dish with a grid of electrodes embedded in its surface, enabling extracellular recording of action potentials of neural cultures grown over the array. Pharmaceutical grade BoNT A was applied to the media bath of mature cortical networks cultured on MEAs. Both spontaneous and evoked activities were monitored over 1 wk to quantify changes In the neural population produced by BoNTA. Introduction of RoNT A resulted in an I Increased duration and number of spikes in spontaneous and evoked bursts relative to control cultures. Increases 1 were significant within 48 h of BoNT A dosage (P < 0.05). Application of BoNT A also Induced unique oscillatory behavior within each burst that Is reminiscent of early developmental activity patterns rather than the mature cultures used here. Three or more activity peaks were observed in 50% of the BoNT dosed cultures. Control cultures exhibited only a single activity peak, Thus activity of these cortical networks measured with MEAs could provide a valuable substrate for BoNT detection.

AB Objective: To determine work of breathing per minute or power of breathing noninvasively (POBN) by using an artificial neural network (ANN) without the need for an esophageal catheter in patients with respiratory failure.
   Design: Prospective study comparing the relationship between POBN and invasively measured power of breathing (POBI).
   Setting: Intensive care unit of a university hospital.
   Patients. Forty-five intubated adults (age, 51 +/- 11 yrs; weight, 71 +/- 18 kg; 28 males and 17 females) receiving pressure support ventilation (PSY). Interventions: Data from an esophageal catheter and airway pressure/flow sensor were used to measure POBI. A pretrained ANN provided real time calculation of POBN. POBI and POBN were measured at various levels of PSV, ranging from 5 to 25 cm H2O.
   Measurements and Main Results. POBN was highly correlated with POBI (r = 0.91; p < .002), and because POBN explained or predicted 83% of the variance in POBI, it was considered a very good predictor (r(2) = 0.83; P < .002). Bias was negligible (0.00) and precision was clinically acceptable (2.2 J/min).
   Conclusions. POB can be calculated noninvasively with reasonable clinical accuracy for patients receiving ventilatory support by using an ANN. This method obviates the need for inserting an esophageal catheter and thus greatly simplifies measurement of POB. POBI may be a clinically useful tool for consideration when setting PSV to unload the respiratory muscles. Before considering its use in clinical practice, POBI would need to be incorporated within the context of load tolerance and shown to improve outcomes.

AB Background Recently, tau PET tracers have shown strong associations with clinical outcomes in individuals with cognitive impairment and cognitively unremarkable elderly individuals. flortaucipir PET scans to measure tau deposition in multiple brain areas as the disease progresses. This information needs to be summarized to evaluate disease severity and predict disease progression. We, therefore, sought to develop a machine learning-derived index, SPARE-Tau, which successfully detects pathology in the earliest disease stages and accurately predicts progression compared to a priori-based region of interest approaches (ROI).
   Methods 587 participants of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort had flortaucipir scans, structural MRI scans, and an A beta biomarker test (CSF or florbetapir PET) performed on the same visit. We derived the SPARE-Tau index in a subset of 367 participants. We evaluated associations with clinical measures for CSF p-tau, SPARE-MRI, and flortaucipir PET indices (SPARE-Tau, meta-temporal, and average Braak ROIs). Bootstrapped multivariate adaptive regression splines linear regression analyzed the association between the biomarkers and baseline ADAS-Cog13 scores. Bootstrapped multivariate linear regression models evaluated associations with clinical diagnosis. Cox-hazards and mixed-effects models investigated clinical progression and longitudinal ADAS-Cog13 changes. The A beta positive cognitively unremarkable participants, not included in the SPARE-Tau training, served as an independent validation group.
   Results Compared to CSF p-tau, meta-temporal, and averaged Braak tau PET ROIs, SPARE-Tau showed the strongest association with baseline ADAS-cog13 scores and diagnosis. SPARE-Tau also presented the strongest association with clinical progression in cognitively unremarkable participants and longitudinal ADAS-Cog13 changes. Results were confirmed in the A beta+ cognitively unremarkable hold-out sample participants. CSF p-tau showed the weakest cross-sectional associations and longitudinal prediction.
   Discussion Flortaucipir indices showed the strongest clinical association among the studied biomarkers (flortaucipir, florbetapir, structural MRI, and CSF p-tau) and were predictive in the preclinical disease stages. Among the flortaucipir indices, the machine-learning derived SPARE-Tau index was the most sensitive clinical progression biomarker. The combination of different biomarker modalities better predicted cognitive performance.

ID NEURAL-NETWORKS; DYNAMICS; MODEL
AB We derive a synaptic weight update rule for learning temporally precise spike train-to-spike train transformations in multilayer feedforward networks of spiking neurons. The framework, aimed at seamlessly generalizing error backpropagation to the deterministic spiking neuron setting, is based strictly on spike timing and avoids invoking concepts pertaining to spike rates or probabilistic models of spiking. The derivation is founded on two innovations. First, an error functional is proposed that compares the spike train emitted by the output neuron of the network to the desired spike train by way of their putative impact on a virtual postsynaptic neuron. This formulation sidesteps the need for spike alignment and leads to closed-form solutions for all quantities of interest. Second, virtual assignment of weights to spikes rather than synapses enables a perturbation analysis of individual spike times and synaptic weights of the output, as well as all intermediate neurons in the network, which yields the gradients of the error functional with respect to the said entities. Learning proceeds via a gradient descent mechanism that leverages these quantities. Simulation experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed learning framework. The experiments also highlight asymmetries between synapses on excitatory and inhibitory neurons.

AB Camera-based systems are increasingly used for collecting information on intersections and arterials. Unlike loop controllers that can generally be only used for detection and movement of vehicles, cameras can provide rich information about the traffic behavior. Vision-based frameworks for multiple-object detection, object tracking, and near-miss detection have been developed to derive this information. However, much of this work currently addresses processing videos offline. In this article, we propose an integrated two-stream convolutional networks architecture that performs real-time detection, tracking, and near-accident detection of road users in traffic video data. The two-stream model consists of a spatial stream network for object detection and a temporal stream network to leverage motion features for multiple-object tracking. We detect near-accidents by incorporating appearance features and motion features from these two networks. Further, we demonstrate that our approaches can be executed in real-time and at a frame rate that is higher than the video frame rate on a variety of videos collected from fisheye and overhead cameras.

ID TRACKING
AB In this work, the authors propose a novel decentralised coordination scheme for autonomous ground vehicles to enable map building and path planning with a network of smart overhead cameras. Decentralised indoor smart camera mapping and hierarchical navigation supports the automatic generation of waypoint graphs for each camera in an environment and allows path planning through the environment across multiple camera fields of view, or subviews. The proposed solution utilises the growing neural gas algorithm to learn the topology of unoccupied working space in each subview for maintaining a dynamic waypoint graph on each camera. The authors' pathing solution leverages a modified version of the A* algorithm to compute paths in a decentralised and hierarchical fashion. Waypoint generation was simulated and analysed on a generated environment to ensure it is both effective and efficient, while path planning was simulated on various randomised hierarchical graphs to effectively compare the proposed Decentralised-A* (D-A*) algorithm against standard greedy search. The proposed method efficiently handles the cases where other robot navigation methods are otherwise weak and ineffective, while still providing avenues for further optimisation of resource overhead for both the smart camera network as well as the robots themselves.

AB Variations in the amplitude and period of essential and Parkinsonian tremors were studied. It was found that the variations in frequency (or period) were mostly similar to the white noise, with the standard deviation typically less than 10% of the mean, whereas the variations in amplitude were much larger, with standard deviations greater than 30% of the mean, and so could not be effectively smoothed by running means. It is conjectured that variations in frequency reflect the stable nature of the neural network that generates the rhythmicity responsible for the tremor. The variations in amplitude, however, reflect more the fluctuations in the firing of individual neurons in the network. It is further discussed that the oscillator behind pathological tremor has a stochastic nature and can be characterised as a diffusional process. The latter suggests that it is sometimes possible for tremors to be described as chaotic processes on certain scales in phase space. It is further discussed how the stochastic nature of tremors determines the lack of correlation between different tremulous parts of the body.

AB Human communication not only involves the need to switch between the modalities of speaking and listening, but for bilinguals, it can also involve switching between languages. It is unknown as to whether modality and language switching share underlying control mechanisms or whether one type of switching affects control processes involved in the other. The present study uses behavioral and fMRI measures to examine neural circuits of control during communicative situations that required Chinese-English bilinguals to switch between modalities and their two languages according to associated color cues. The results showed that for both language and modality control, similar brain regions were recruited during speech production and comprehension. For modality control, the specific control processes partly depended on the corresponding modality. Finally, switching between modalities appears to exert more influence on language control in production compared to comprehension. These findings offer a first detailed characterization of the neural bases involved in control mechanisms in bilingual communication.

AB In recent years, there has been a growing interest in realizing methodologies to integrate more and more computation at the level of the image sensor. The rising trend has seen an increased research interest in developing novel event cameras that can facilitate CNN computation directly in the sensor. However, event-based cameras ca be expensive, limiting performance exploration on high-level models and algorithms. This paper presents an event camera simulator that can be a potent tool for hardware design prototyping, parameter optimization, attention-based innovative algorithm development, and benchmarking. The proposed simulator implements a distributed computation model to identify relevant regions in an image frame. Our simulator's relevance computation model is realized as a collection of modules and performs computations in parallel. The distributed computation model is configurable, making it highly useful for design space exploration. The Rendering engine of the simulator samples frame-regions only when there is a new event. The simulator closely emulates an image processing pipeline similar to that of physical cameras. Our experimental results show that the simulator can effectively emulate event vision with low overheads

ID ADAPTATION
AB Visual domain adaptation aims to seek an effective transferable model for unlabeled target images by benefiting from the well-labeled source images following different distributions. Many recent efforts focus on extracting domain-invariant image representations via exploring target pseudo labels, predicted by the source classifier, to further mitigate the conditional distribution shift across domains. However, two essential factors are overlooked by most existing methods: 1) the learned transferable features should be not only domain invariant but also category discriminative; and 2) the target pseudo label is a two-edged sword to cross-domain alignment. In other words, the wrongly predicted target labels may hinder the class-wise domain matching. In this article, to address these two issues simultaneously, we propose a discriminative transfer feature and label consistency (DTLC) approach for visual domain adaptation problems, which can naturally unify cross-domain alignment with discriminative information preserved and label consistency of source and target data into one framework. To be specific, DTLC first incorporates class discriminative information by penalizing the maximum distance of data pair in the same class and the minimum distance of data pair sharing the different labels for each data into the distribution alignment of both domains. The target pseudo labels are then refined based on the label consistency within the domains. Thus, the transfer feature learning and coarse-to-fine target labels would be coupled to benefit each other in an iterative way. Comprehensive experiments on several visual cross-domain benchmarks verify that DTLC can gain remarkable margins over state-of-the-art (SOTA) nondeep visual domain adaptation methods and even be comparable to competitive deep domain adaptation ones.

AB Individuals exhibit significant variability in their ability to adapt locomotor skills, with some adapting quickly and others more slowly. Differences in brain activity likely contribute to this variability, but direct neural evidence is lacking. We investigated individual differences in electrocortical activity that led to faster locomotor adaptation rates. We recorded high-density electroencephalography while young, neurotypical adults adapted their walking on a split-belt treadmill and grouped them based on how quickly they restored their gait symmetry. Results revealed unique spectral signatures within the posterior parietal, bilateral sensorimotor, and right visual cortices that differ between fast and slow adapters. Specifically, fast adapters exhibited lower alpha power in the posterior parietal and right visual cortices during early adaptation, associated with quicker attainment of steady-state step length symmetry. Decreased posterior parietal alpha may reflect enhanced spatial attention, sensory integration, and movement planning to facilitate faster locomotor adaptation. Conversely, slow adapters displayed greater alpha and beta power in the right visual cortex during late adaptation, suggesting potential differences in visuospatial processing. Additionally, fast adapters demonstrated reduced spectral power in the bilateral sensorimotor cortices compared with slow adapters, particularly in the theta band, which may suggest variations in perception of the split-belt perturbation. These findings suggest that alpha and beta oscillations in the posterior parietal and visual cortices and theta oscillations in the sensorimotor cortex are related to the rate of gait adaptation.

TI Estimating Field Capacity from Volumetric Soil Water Content Time Series
   Using Automated Processing Algorithms
SO VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL

ID PREFERENTIAL FLOW; MOISTURE CONTENT; SENSOR; INFILTRATION; NETWORK
AB Vadose zone measurements of volumetric soil water content (theta) using soil moisture sensors (SMSs) have become more common due to advances in technology and reduction of costs. Soil moisture sensor data exhibit a characteristic cyclical pattern reflecting water flux dynamics into and out of the observed soil volume. Expert review of SMS datasets to distinguish valid from corrupt or incomplete soil water cycles is arguably the most precise method for determining field capacity (theta(FC)) but is impractically cumbersome and time consuming for increasingly large SMS datasets. We evaluated competing approaches for automated soil water cycles analysis that use widely available R packages based on pattern recognition and machine learning (findpeaks [R-FP], symbolic aggregate approximation [R-SAX], and density histogram [R-DH]), and a MATLAB code based on soil water dynamic principles (SWDP). These approaches were applied to three SMS datasets. Our empirical results showed superiority of R-SAX for identifying valid soil water cycles, probably due to benefiting from training sets to calibrate to correct cycles. Two other approaches (SWDP and R-FP) provided similar results without need of training sets or preprocessing data. Three approaches for estimating field capacity were applied to valid cycles, R-FP, regression of exponential decay (SWDP-R), and estimated "knee" of curve (SWDP-K). Each performed similarly to the expert defined values, with R-FP and SWDP-R generally performing best across analyses. Results of this study also show temporal dynamics of theta(FC) within datasets used here. There is potential for optimizing theta(FC) and a need for automated, objective analysis to leverage dynamics in irrigation management and modeling.

AB Weed control between plastic covered, raised beds in Florida vegetable crops relies predominantly on herbicides. Broadcast applications of post-emergence herbicides are unnecessary due to the general patchy distribution of weed populations. Development of precision herbicide sprayers to apply herbicides where weeds occur would result in input reductions. The objective of the study was to test a state-of-the-art object detection convolutional neural network, You Only Look Once 3 (YOLOV3), to detect vegetation both indiscriminately (1-class network) and to detect and discriminate three classes of vegetation commonly found within Florida vegetable plasticulture row-middles (3-class network). Vegetation was discriminated into three categories: broadleaves, sedges and grasses. The 3-class network (Fscore = 0.95) outperformed the 1-class network (Fscore = 0.93) in overall vegetation detection. The increase in target variability when combining classes increased and potentially negated benefits from pooling classes into a single target (and increasing the available data per class). The 3-class network Fscores for grasses, sedges and broadleaves were 0.96, 0.96 and 0.93 respectively. Recall was the limiting factor for all classes. With consideration to how much of the plant was identified (broadleaves and grasses), the 3-class network (Fscore = 0.93) outperformed the 1-class network (Fscore = 0.79). The 1-class network struggled to detect grassy weed species (recall = 0.59). Use of YOLOV3 as an object detector for discrimination of vegetation classes is a feasible option for incorporation into precision applicators.

ID CARBON; FOREST
AB Amazonian dark earth (ADE) is highly nutrient- and carbon-rich soil created by past inhabitants of the Amazon. It would be valuable to know the extent of ADE because of its cultural and environmental importance, but systematic efforts to map its distribution and extent are impractical with traditional field methods. We use remote-sensing imagery and a machine-learning classifier with ground-truthed training data to predict the occurrence of ADE across the 26,000 km2 Territ & oacute;rio Ind & iacute;gena do Xingu (TIX) in the southeastern Amazon region of Brazil. We find widespread ADE across the TIX, well beyond previously studied archaeological sites, occupying at least 3-4% of the land area. We further estimate that the TIX may sequester 9 Mt of carbon within ADE deposits from past human inputs. Our findings show that ancient inhabitants of the TIX substantially modified their environment, highlighting the importance of conserving this natural and cultural resource given threats from climate change and deforestation.
   Past human land modification in the Amazon has resulted in nutrient- and carbon-rich soil deposits of great cultural and environmental value. A new remote-sensing and machine-learning approach reveals the extent of Amazonian dark earth and its potentially substantial carbon reservoir.

AB Understanding ecological niches of major tick species and prevalent tick-borne pathogens is crucial for efficient surveillance and control of tick-borne diseases. Here we provide an up-to-date review on the spatial distributions of ticks and tick-borne pathogens in China. We map at the county level 124 tick species, 103 tick-borne agents, and human cases infected with 29 species (subspecies) of tick-borne pathogens that were reported in China during 1950-2018. Haemaphysalis longicornis is found to harbor the highest variety of tick-borne agents, followed by Ixodes persulcatus, Dermacentor nutalli and Rhipicephalus microplus. Using a machine learning algorithm, we assess ecoclimatic and socioenvironmental drivers for the distributions of 19 predominant vector ticks and two tick-borne pathogens associated with the highest disease burden. The model-predicted suitable habitats for the 19 tick species are 14476% larger in size than the geographic areas where these species were detected, indicating severe under-detection. Tick species harboring pathogens of imminent threats to public health should be prioritized for more active field surveillance. Ticks are an important vector of disease in China, posing threats to humans, livestock and wild animals. Here, Zhao et al. compile a database of the distributions of the 124 tick species known in China and 103 tick-borne pathogens and predict the additional suitable habitats for the predominant vector species.

ID DYNAMIC SIMULATIONS; DATA AUGMENTATION; PREDICTION
AB Obtaining large biomechanical datasets for machine learning is an ongoing challenge. Physics-based simulations offer one approach for generating large datasets, but many simulation methods, such as computed muscle control (CMC), are computationally costly. In contrast, interpolation methods, such as inverse distance weighting (IDW), are computationally fast. We examined whether IDW is a low-cost and accurate approach for interpolating muscle activations from CMC. IDW was evaluated using lateral pinch simulations in OpenSim. Simulated pinch data were organized into grids of varying sparsity (high, medium, and low density), where each grid point represented the muscle activations associated with a unique combination of mass and height of a young adult. For each grid, muscle activations were calculated via CMC and IDW for 108 random mass-height pairs that were not coincident with simulation grid vertices. We evaluated the interpolation errors from IDW for each grid, as well as the sensitivity of lateral pinch force to these errors. The root mean square error (RMSE) associated with interpolated muscle activations decreased with increasing grid density and never exceeded 4%. While CMC received a target thumb-tip force of 40 N, errors from the interpolated muscle activations never impacted the simulated force magnitude by more than 0.1 N. Furthermore, the computation time for CMC simulations aver-aged 4.22 core-minutes, while IDW averaged 0.95 core-seconds per mass-height pair. These results indicate IDW is a practical approach for rapidly estimating muscle activations from sparse CMC datasets. Future works could adapt our IDW approach to evaluate other tasks, biomechanical features, and/or populations.

AB A Gabor wavelets based technique was investigated as a potential tool for scene classification (into one of bare patch, plant, or weed) for its ultimate utility in site-specific application of agrochemicals in wild blueberry fields. Images were gathered from five sites located in central Nova Scotia, Canada. Gabor wavelet features extracted from these images were used to classify scenes according to visually determined classes using step-wise linear discriminant analysis.For individual fields, classification accuracy attained ranged between 87.9% and 98.3%; selected Gabor features ranged between 27 and 72; contextual accuracy for herbicide ranged between 67.5% and 96.7%, and contextual accuracy for fertilizer ranged between 63.6% and 97.1%. The pooled scenes yielded a classification accuracy of 81.4%, and contextual accuracy figures of 61.1% and 73.1% for herbicide and fertilizer, respectively, with selected Gabor features of 36. Calibrations based on LDA coefficients from the pooled scenes could help avoid the need to re-calibrate for each field, whereas those based on individual field LDA coefficients could improve accuracy, hence enable saving on expensive agrochemicals.& COPY; 2021 The Authors.

AB Despite the best efforts of cyber security analysts, networked computing assets are routinely compromised, resulting in the loss of intellectual property, the disclosure of state secrets, and major financial damages. Anomaly detection methods are beneficial for detecting new types of attacks and abnormal network activity, but such algorithms can be difficult to understand and trust. Network operators and cyber analysts need fast and scalable tools to help identify suspicious behavior that bypasses automated security systems, but operators do not want another automated tool with algorithms they do not trust. Experts need tools to augment their own domain expertise and to provide a contextual understanding of suspicious behavior to help them make decisions. In this paper we present Situ, a visual analytics system for discovering suspicious behavior in streaming network data. Situ provides a scalable solution that combines anomaly detection with information visualization. The system's visualizations enable operators to identify and investigate the most anomalous events and IP addresses, and the tool provides context to help operators understand why they are anomalous. Finally; operators need tools that can be integrated into their workflow and with their existing tools. This paper describes the Situ platform and its deployment in an operational network setting. We discuss how operators are currently using the tool in a large organization's security operations center and present the results of expert reviews with professionals.

TI Leveraging multimodal social media data for rapid disaster damage

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION

   analysis; Social media; Text mining
AB During disaster response and recovery stages, stakeholders including governmental agencies collect disaster's impact information to inform disaster relief, resource allocation, and infrastructure reconstruction. The damage data collected using field surveys and satellite imagery are often not available immediately after a disaster while rapid information is crucial for time-sensitive decision makings. Some researchers turned to social media for realtime situational information of disaster damage. However, existing damage assessment research mostly focused on single data modality (i.e. text or image) and made coarse-grained predictions, which limited their practical applications in assisting city-level operations. The difficulties of retrieving useful information from vast noisy social media data have been outlined by many studies. Thus, we propose a data-driven method to locate and assess disaster damage with massive multimodal social media data. The method splits and processes two data modalities, i.e. texts and images, using two modules. The image analysis module uses five machine learning classifiers that are organized in a hierarchical structure. The text analysis module uses a keyword search-based method. They together mine various damage information including hazard types (e.g. wind and flood), hazard severities, damage types (e.g. infrastructure destruction and housing damage). The method is applied and evaluated with two recent hurricane events. In practice, the method acquires damage information throughout extreme events and supplements conventional damage assessment methods. It enables the rapid damage information access and disaster response for both first responders and the general public. The research effort contributes to achieving more transparent and effective disaster relief activities.

AB Machine-learning (ML) techniques are explored to identify and classify hadronic decays of highly Lorentz-boosted W/Z/Higgs bosons and top quarks. Techniques without ML have also been evaluated and are included for comparison. The identification performances of a variety of algorithms are characterized in simulated events and directly compared with data. The algorithms are validated using proton-proton collision data at root S = 13 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.9 fb(-1). Systematic uncertainties are assessed by comparing the results obtained using simulation and collision data. The new techniques studied in this paper provide significant performance improvements over non-ML techniques, reducing the background rate by up to an order of magnitude at the same signal efficiency.

AB In this study, the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) for estimating reaction rates in enzymatic hydrolysis of squid waste protein was investigated. This is a complex process because a number of inherent simultaneous inhibition and enzyme inactivation reactions occur during hydrolysis that make it difficult to develop a reliable kinetic model by more traditional deterministic approaches. A series of 12 enzyme hydrolysis experiments were carried out on samples of squid waste under specified conditions of temperature, pH, and initial enzyme and substrate concentrations. Experimental data in the form of substrate concentration over time were taken as real time course data (TCD), and divided into three groups for respective use in training, validating, and testing the model. A feed-forward architecture was utilized to construct the necessary predictive model. The network was trained until the mean squared error function between target and actual output values reached a desired minimum. Data sets from the remaining two groups were used for subsequent validation and testing of the model. The model performed well when tested against experimental data in the third group (not used in its development) and taken over a wide range of initial conditions. Maximum differences between experimental and predicted values of substrate concentration at any point in time ranged from 0.3 to 0.5 g L-1 (1% to 3% of initial substrate concentration), with correlation coefficients between predicted and experimental results ranging from 0.95 to 0.97.

AB This work is devoted to the development of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models of the biological activity of 123 1-phenylbenzimidazoles as inhibitors of the PDGF receptor, The molecular features are represented by chemical descriptors that have been calculated on geometrical, topological, quantum mechanical, and electronic basis by using CODESSA PRO. The obtained models, linear (multilinear regression) and nonlinear (artificial neural network), are aimed to link the structures to their reported activity log 1/IC50. The former model can be used for physico-chemical interpretation, while the latter possesses a superior predictive ability. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Estimates of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks are essential for many environmental applications. However, significant inconsistencies exist in SOC stock estimates for the U.S. across current SOC maps. We propose a framework that combines unsupervised multivariate geographic clustering (MGC) and supervised Random Forests regression, improving SOC maps by capturing heterogeneous relationships with SOC drivers. We first used MGC to divide the U.S. into 20 SOC regions based on the similarity of covariates (soil biogeochemical, bioclimatic, biological, and physiographic variables). Subsequently, separate Random Forests models were trained for each SOC region, utilizing environmental covariates and SOC observations. Our estimated SOC stocks for the U.S. (52.6 +/- 3.2 Pg for 0-30 cm and 108.3 +/- 8.2 Pg for 0-100 cm depth) were within the range estimated by existing products like Harmonized World Soil Database, HWSD (46.7 Pg for 0-30 cm and 90.7 Pg for 0-100 cm depth) and SoilGrids 2.0 (45.7 Pg for 0-30 cm and 133.0 Pg for 0-100 cm depth). However, independent validation with soil profile data from the National Ecological Observatory Network showed that our approach (R2 = 0.51) outperformed the estimates obtained from Harmonized World Soil Database (R2 = 0.23) and SoilGrids 2.0 (R2 = 0.39) for the topsoil (0-30 cm). Uncertainty analysis (e.g., low representativeness and high coefficients of variation) identified regions requiring more measurements, such as Alaska and the deserts of the U.S. Southwest. Our approach effectively captures the heterogeneous relationships between widely available predictors and the current SOC baseline across regions, offering reliable SOC estimates at 1 km resolution for benchmarking Earth system models.
   Soils represent the largest terrestrial carbon (C) pool. To understand how soil C will change under a changing climate, we first need to have an accurate estimate of how much soil organic carbon (SOC) is present. However, SOC maps for the U.S. are highly variable. In this study, we developed a new framework for estimating SOC stocks across the entire U.S. using data from site-level measurements. We first divided the U.S. into 20 regions based on environmental conditions and then created machine-learning models for each region to make an accurate, continuous map. Our method was able to capture different relationships between environmental variables and SOC across regions and improved the overall estimates for the amount of SOC found in U.S. soils. While in all regions, climate was an important variable for predicting SOC, soil properties, plant inputs, and elevation played key roles in some regions. As part of this effort, we identified areas with high uncertainty, which could be target regions for additional measurements in the future (e.g., Alaska and the deserts of the Southwest U.S.). Our method provides new insights for the soil mapping community and yields robust SOC estimates that can inform the terrestrial C cycle in models.

AB The anti-invasive activity of 139 compounds was correlated by an artificial neural network approach with descriptors calculated solely from the molecular structures using CODESSA Pro. The best multilinear regression method implemented in CODESSA Pro was used for a pre-selection of descriptors. The resulting nonlinear (artificial neural network) QSAR model predicted the exact class for 66 (71%) of the training set of 93 compounds and 32 (70%) of validation set of 46 compounds. The standard deviation ratios for the both training and validation sets are less than unity, indicating a satisfactory predictive capability for classification of the nature of the anti-invasive activity data. The proposed model can be used for the prediction of the anti-invasive activity of novel classes of compounds enabling a virtual screening of large databases of anticancer drugs.

AB Marine resource management is shifting from optimizing single species yield to redefining sustainable fisheries within the context of managing ocean use and ecosystem health. In this introductory article to the theme set, Plugging spatial ecology into ecosystem-based management (EBM) we conduct an informal horizon scan with leaders in EBM research to identify three rapidly evolving areas that will be game changers in integrating spatial ecology into EBM. These are: (1) new data streams from fishers, genomics, and technological advances in remote sensing and bio-logging; (2) increased analytical power through Big Data and artificial intelligence; and (3) better integration of social dimensions into management. We address each of these areas by first imagining capacity in 20 years from now, and then highlighting emerging efforts to get us there, drawing on articles in this theme set, other scientific literature, and presentations/discussions from the symposium on Linkages between spatial ecology and sustainable fisheries held at the ICES Annual Science Conference in September 2017.

AB The application of land use regression (LUR) modeling for estimating air pollution exposure has been used only rarely in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This is generally due to a lack of air quality monitoring networks in the region. Low cost air quality sensors developed locally in sub-Saharan Africa presents a sustainable operating mechanism that may help generate the air monitoring data needed for exposure estimation of air pollution with LUR models. The primary objective of our study is to investigate whether a network of locally developed low-cost air quality sensors can be used in LUR modeling for accurately predicting monthly ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution in urban areas of central and eastern Uganda. Secondarily, we aimed to explore whether the application of machine learning (ML) can improve LUR predictions compared to ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. We used data for the entire year of 2020 from a network of 23 PM2.5 low-cost sensors located in urban municipalities of eastern and central Uganda. Between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, these sensors collected highly time-resolved measurement data of PM2.5 air concentrations. We used monthlyaveraged PM2.5 concentration data for LUR prediction modeling of monthly PM2.5 concentrations. We used eight different ML base-learner algorithms as well as ensemble modeling. We applied 5-fold cross validation (80% training/20% test random splits) to evaluate the models with resampling and Root mean squared error (RMSE). The relative explanatory power and accuracy of the ML algorithms were evaluated by comparing coefficient of determination (R2) and RMSE, using OLS as the reference approach. The overall average PM2.5 concentration during the study period was 52.22 mu g/m3 (IQR: 38.11, 62.84 mu g/m3)-well above World Health Organization PM2.5 ambient air guidelines. From the base-learner and ensemble models, RMSE and R2 values ranged between 7.65 mu g/m3 - 16.85 mu g/m3 and 0.24-0.84, respectively. Extreme gradient boosting (xgbTree) performed best out of the base learner algorithms (R2 = 0.84; RMSE = 7.65 mu g/m3). Model performance from ensemble modeling with Lasso and Elastic-Net Regularized Generalized Linear Models (glmnet) did not outperform xgbTree, but prediction performance was comparable to that of xgbTree. The most important temporal and spatial predictors of monthly PM2.5 levels were monthly precipitation, percent of the population using solid fuels for cooking, distance to Lake Victoria, and greenspace (NDVI) within a 500-m buffer of air monitors. In conclusion, data from locally developed low-cost PM sensors provide evidence that they can be used for spatiotemporal prediction modeling of air pollution exposures in Uganda. Moreover, the non-parametric ML and ensemble approaches to LUR modeling clearly outperformed OLS regression algorithm for the prediction of monthly PM2.5 concentrations. Deploying low-cost air quality sensors in concert with implementation of data quality control measures, can help address the critical need for expanding and improving air quality monitoring in resource-constrained settings of sub-Saharan Africa. These low-cost sensors, in conjunction with nonparametric ML algorithms, may provide a rapid path forward for PM2.5 exposure assessment and to spur air pollution epidemiology research in the region.

AB Learning causal effects from observational data, e.g. estimating the effect of a treatment on survival by datamining electronic health records (EHRs), can be biased due to unmeasured confounders, mediators, and colliders. When the causal dependencies among features/covariates are expressed in the form of a directed acyclic graph, using do-calculus it is possible to identify one or more adjustment sets for eliminating the bias on a given causal query under certain assumptions. However, prior knowledge of the causal structure might be only partial; algorithms for causal structure discovery often provide ambiguous solutions, and their computational complexity becomes practically intractable when the feature sets grow large. We hypothesize that the estimation of the true causal effect of a causal query on to an outcome can be approximated as an ensemble of lower complexity estimators, namely bagged random causal networks. A bagged random causal network is an ensemble of subnetworks constructed by sampling the feature subspaces (with the query, the outcome, and a random number of other features), drawing conditional dependencies among the features, and inferring the corresponding adjustment sets. The causal effect can be then estimated by any regression function of the outcome by the query paired with the adjustment sets. Through simulations and a real-world clinical dataset (class III malocclusion data), we show that the bagged estimator is ?in most cases? consistent with the true causal effect if the structure is known, has a good variance/bias trade-off when the structure is unknown (estimated using heuristics), has lower computational complexity than learning a full network, and outperforms boosted regression. In conclusion, the bagged random causal network is well-suited to estimate query-target causal effects from observational studies on EHR and other high-dimensional biomedical databases.

AB Nanoparticles (NPs) have been widely used in different areas, including consumer products and medicine. In terms of biomedical applications, NPs or NP-based drug formulations have been extensively investigated for cancer diagnostics and therapy in preclinical studies, but the clinical translation rate is low. Therefore, a thorough and comprehensive understanding of the pharmacokinetics of NPs, especially in drug delivery efficiency to the target therapeutic tissue tumor, is important to design more effective nanomedicines and for proper assessment of the safety and risk of NPs. This review article focuses on the pharmacokinetics of both organic and inorganic NPs and their tumor delivery efficiencies, as well as the associated mechanisms involved. We discuss the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) processes following different routes of exposure and the mechanisms involved. Many physicochemical properties and experimental factors, including particle type, size, surface charge, zeta potential, surface coating, protein binding, dose, exposure route, species, cancer type, and tumor size can affect NP pharmacokinetics and tumor delivery efficiency. NPs can be absorbed with varying degrees following different exposure routes and mainly accumulate in liver and spleen, but also distribute to other tissues such as heart, lung, kidney and tumor tissues; and subsequently get metabolized and/or excreted mainly through hepatobiliary and renal elimination. Passive and active targeting strategies are the two major mechanisms of tumor delivery, while active targeting tends to have less toxicity and higher delivery efficiency through direct interaction between ligands and receptors. We also discuss challenges and perspectives remaining in the field of pharmacokinetics and tumor delivery efficiency of NPs.

AB A method relying on the convex combination of two normalized filtered-s least mean square algorithms (CNFSLMS) is presented for nonlinear active noise control (ANC) systems with a linear secondary path (LSP) and nonlinear secondary path (NSP) in this paper. The proposed CNFSLMS algorithm-based functional link artificial neural network (FLANN) filter, aiming to overcome the compromise between convergence speed and steady state mean square error of the NFSLMS algorithm, offers both fast convergence rate and low steady state error. Furthermore, by replacing the sigmoid function with the modified Versorial function, the modified CNFSLMS (MCNFSLMS) algorithm with low computational complexity is also presented. Experimental results illustrate that the combination scheme can behave as well as the best component and even better. Moreover, the MCNFSLMS algorithm requires less computational complexity than the CNFSLMS while keeping the same filtering performance. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Algorithms for moving objects databases
SO COMPUTER JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
ID TIME
AB Whereas earlier work on spatiotemporal databases generally focused on geometries changing in discrete steps, the emerging area of moving objects databases supports geometries changing continuously. Two important abstractions are moving point and moving region, modelling objects for which only the time-dependent position, or also the shape and extent are relevant, respectively. Examples of the first kind of moving entity are all kinds of vehicles, aircraft, people or animals; of the latter hurricanes, forest fires, forest growth or oil spills in the sea. The goal is to develop data models and query languages as well as DBMS implementations supporting such entities, enabling new kinds of database applications. In earlier work we have proposed an approach based on abstract data types. Hence, moving point or moving region are viewed as data types with suitable operations. For example, a moving point might be projected into the plane, yielding a curve, or a moving region be mapped to a function describing the development of its size, yielding a real-valued function. A careful design of a system of types and operations (an algebra) has been presented, emphasizing completeness, closure, consistency and genericity. This design was given at an abstract level, defining, for example, geometries in terms of infinite point sets. In the next step, a discrete model was presented, offering finite representations and data structures for all the types of the abstract model. The present paper provides the final step towards implementation by studying and developing systematically algorithms for (a large subset of) the operations. Some of them are relatively straightforward; others are quite complex. Algorithms are meant to be used in a database context; we also address filtering techniques and practical issues such as large object management or numeric robustness in the context of an ongoing prototype implementation.

AB Transient propagation of information across neuronal assembles is thought to underlie many cognitive processes. However, the nature of the neural code that is embedded within these transmissions remains uncertain. Much of our understanding of how information is transmitted among these assemblies has been derived from computational models. While these models have been instrumental in understanding these processes they often make simplifying assumptions about the biophysical properties of neurons that may influence the nature and properties expressed. To address this issue we created an in vitro analog of a feed-forward network composed of two small populations (also referred to as assemblies or layers) of living dissociated rat cortical neurons. The populations were separated by, and communicated through, a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) device containing a strip of microscale tunnels. Delayed culturing of one population in the first layer followed by the second a few days later induced the unidirectional growth of axons through the microtunnels resulting in a primarily feed-forward communication between these two small neural populations. In this study we systematically manipulated the number of tunnels that connected each layer and hence, the number of axons providing communication between those populations. We then assess the effect of reducing the number of tunnels has upon the properties of between-layer communication capacity and fidelity of neural transmission among spike trains transmitted across and within layers. We show evidence based on Victor-Purpura's and van Rossum's spike train similarity metrics supporting the presence of both rate and temporal information embedded within these transmissions whose fidelity increased during communication both between and within layers when the number of tunnels are increased. We also provide evidence reinforcing the role of synchronized activity upon transmission fidelity during the spontaneous synchronized network burst events that propagated between layers and highlight the potential applications of these MEMs devices as a tool for further investigation of structure and functional dynamics among neural populations.

AB Objective. In this study, we tackle the challenge of latency in magnetic resonance linear accelerator (MR-Linac) systems, which compromises target coverage accuracy in gated real-time radiotherapy. Our focus is on enhancing motion prediction precision in abdominal organs to address this issue. We developed a convolutional long short-term memory (convLSTM) model, utilizing 2D cine magnetic resonance (cine-MR) imaging for this purpose. Approach. Our model, featuring a sequence-to-one architecture with six input frames and one output frame, employs structural similarity index measure (SSIM) as loss function. Data was gathered from 17 cine-MRI datasets using the Philips Ingenia MR-sim system and an Elekta Unity MR-Linac equivalent sequence, focusing on regions of interest (ROIs) like the stomach, liver, pancreas, and kidney. The datasets varied in duration from 1 to 10 min. Main results. The study comprised three main phases: hyperparameter optimization, individual training, and transfer learning with or without fine-tuning. Hyperparameters were initially optimized to construct the most effective model. Then, the model was individually applied to each dataset to predict images four frames ahead (1.24-3.28 s). We evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as SSIM, normalized mean square error, normalized correlation coefficient, and peak signal-to-noise ratio, specifically for ROIs with target motion. The average SSIM values achieved were 0.54, 0.64, 0.77, and 0.66 for the stomach, liver, kidney, and pancreas, respectively. In the transfer learning phase with fine-tuning, the model showed improved SSIM values of 0.69 for the liver and 0.78 for the kidney, compared to 0.64 and 0.37 without fine-tuning. Significance. The study's significant contribution is demonstrating the convLSTM model's ability to accurately predict motion for multiple abdominal organs using a Unity-equivalent MR sequence. This advancement is key in mitigating latency issues in MR-Linac radiotherapy, potentially improving the precision and effectiveness of real-time treatment for abdominal cancers.

AB Breeding programs rely on genotype-by-environment interaction (GEI) to recommend cultivars for specific locations. GEI describes how different genotypes perform under varying environmental conditions. Several methods were proposed to assess adaptability and stability across environments. These methods utilize various statistical approaches like parametric and non-parametric regression, multivariate analysis techniques, and even Bayesian frameworks and artificial intelligence. The accessibility of environmental data through platforms like NASA POWER allows breeders to integrate this information into a breeding process. It has been done by using multi-omics integration models that combine data across various biological levels to create accurate predictive models. In the context of phenotypic adaptability and stability analysis, structural equation modeling (SEM) offers an interesting approach to integrating environmental covariates. This work aimed to propose a novel approach that integrates weather information into adaptability and stability analysis, combining SEM with the established Eberhart and Russell model. Additionally, a user-friendly applet, denoted ECERSEM-AdaptStab, was made available to perform the analysis. This approach utilized data from 12 cotton cultivar trials conducted across two growing seasons at 19 sites. This approach successfully integrated environmental covariates into a phenotypic adaptability and stability analysis of cotton cultivars. Specifically, the genotypes TMG 41 WS, IMA CV 690, DP 555 BGRR, BRS 286 and BRS 369 RF were recommended for favorable environments, while the genotypes TMG 43 WS, IMA 5675 B2RF, IMA 08 WS, NUOPAL, DELTA OPAL, BRS 335, and BRS 368 RF are more suitable for unfavorable environments.

AB Previous literature has associated math literacy with linguistic factors such as verbal ability and phonological skills. However, few studies have investigated linguistic synchrony, shown in mathematical discussions. This study modelled math literacy and examined the relationship of math literacy with linguistic synchrony between students and facilitators. We retrieved data from 20,776 online mathematical discussion threads at a secondary school level. First, we assessed students' math literacy based on their discussions and classified them into high- and low-math literacy groups. Then, we conducted Cross-Recurrence Quantification Analysis (CRQA) to calculate linguistic synchrony within each thread. The result implies that students with high math literacy are more likely to share common words (eg, mathematical terms) with facilitators. At the same time, they would paraphrase the facilitators' words rather than blindly mimic them as the exact sentences or phrases. On the other hand, students with low math literacy tend to use overlapping words with facilitators less frequently and are more likely to repeat the exact same phrases from the facilitators. The findings provide an empirical data analysis and insights into mathematical discussions and linguistic synchrony. In addition, this paper implies the directions to improve online mathematical discussions and foster math literacy.Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Mathematical discussions are known to be an effective way to promote math literacy. Math literacy and linguistic skills have a strong link. Linguistic synchrony is related to better collaboration and common knowledge building. What this paper adds Reveals the relationship between math literacy and linguistic synchrony and deepens the understanding of digital communication in online learning environments. Provides empirical analysis of natural language data in group discussions using CRQA. Conceptualizes linguistic synchrony with three sub-concepts: linguistic concurrence, predictability, and complexity. Implications for practice and/or policy Educators and practitioners could utilize the automatic formative assessment of math literacy based on the student's language use in mathematical discussions. Educational technology researchers and designers could include CRQA indices and recurrence plots in the dashboard design to provide information to support teachers and learners. Teachers would be able to provide real-time interventions to promote effective mathematical communication and foster math literacy throughout mathematical discussions.

TI Use of Natural Language Processing to Extract and Classify Papillary
   Thyroid Cancer Features From Surgical Pathology Reports
SO ENDOCRINE PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
DE artificial intelligence; Natural Language Processing; thyroid cancer
AB Background: We aim to use Natural Language Processing to automate the extraction and classification of thyroid cancer risk factors from pathology reports. Methods: We analyzed 1410 surgical pathology reports from adult papillary thyroid cancer patients from 2010 to 2019. Structured and nonstructured reports were used to create a consensus-based ground truth dictionary and categorized them into modified recurrence risk levels. Nonstructured reports were narrative, while structured reports followed standardized formats. We developed ThyroPath, a rule-based Natural Language Processing pipeline, to extract and classify thyroid cancer features into risk categories. Training involved 225 reports (150 structured, 75 unstructured), with testing on 170 reports (120 structured, 50 unstructured) for evaluation. The pipeline's performance was assessed using both strict and lenient criteria for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score; a metric that combines precision and recall evaluation. Results: In extraction tasks, ThyroPath achieved overall strict F-1 scores of 93% for structured reports and 90% for unstructured reports, covering 18 thyroid cancer pathology features. In classification tasks, ThyroPath-extracted information demonstrated an overall accuracy of 93% in categorizing reports based on their corresponding guideline-based risk of recurrence: 76.9% for high-risk, 86.8% for intermediate risk, and 100% for both low and very low-risk cases. However, ThyroPath achieved 100% accuracy across all risk categories with human extracted pathology information. Conclusions: ThyroPath shows promise in automating the extraction and risk recurrence classification of thyroid pathology reports at large scale. It offers a solution to laborious manual reviews and advancing virtual registries. However, it requires further validation before implementation. (c) 2024 AACE. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Spatial classification with limited observations is important in geographical applications where only a subset of sensors are deployed at certain spots or partial responses are collected in field surveys. For example, in observation-based flood inundation mapping, there is a need to map the full flood extent on geographic terrains based on earth imagery that partially covers a region. Existing research mostly focuses on addressing incomplete or missing data through data cleaning and imputation or modeling missing values as hidden variables in the EM algorithm. These methods, however, assume that missing feature observations are rare and thus are ineffective in problems whereby the vast majority of feature observations are missing. To address this issue, we recently proposed a new approach that incorporates physics-aware structural constraint into the model representation. We design efficient learning and inference algorithms. This paper extends our recent approach by allowing feature values of samples in each class to follow a multi-modal distribution. Evaluations on real-world flood mapping applications show that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods in classification accuracy, and the multi-modal extension is more robust than our early single-modal version. Computational experiments show that the proposed solution is computationally efficient on large datasets.

AB We discuss the collider phenomenology of the model of Minimal Universal Extra Dimensions (MUED) at the Large hadron Collider (LHC). We derive analytical results for all relevant strong pair-production processes of two level 1 Kaluza-Klein partners and use them to validate and correct the existing MUED implementation in the fortran version of the PYTHIA event generator. We also develop a new implementation of the model in the C++ version of PYTHIA. We use our implementations in conjunction with the CHECKMATE package to derive the LHC bounds on MUED from a large number of published experimental analyses from Run 1 at the LHC.

   Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 181 (2010) 122-127
   Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes
   Reasons for new version: The Minimal Universal Extra Dimension (MUED) model was implemented in the PYTHIA6 event generator from version 6.4.18 onwards. The new version now allows for different masses for various level 1 KK excitations, modified and corrected subroutines to handle the kinematics and squared matrix elements. A new production process has been added. Additionally the model is now made available in the PYTHIA8 event generator.
   Summary of revisions: The Minimal Universal Extra Dimension (MUED) model implementation in the PYTHIA6 event generator now allows for different masses for various level 1 KK excitations. These may appear both in the final states and in the propagators of t/u channel contributions. Routines handling the kinematics and squared matrix elements are suitably modified to incorporate correct kinematics and ensure proper interferences of diagrams. For some processes, corrections in the expressions for the existing squared matrix elements have been made. A new subprocess q (q) over bar -> g(1)*g(1)* has been added. A couple of production modes (which originally had some subprocesses lumped together) are now split to handle different masses of doublet and singlet KK excitations.
   Nature of problem: The ongoing run of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN continues to look for new physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). For many years, the only complete models which were seriously investigated by the LHC collaborations, were different versions of low energy supersymmetry: mSUGRA, gauge-mediated SUSY, anomaly-mediated SUSY, etc. The MUED model provides an interesting and motivated alternative to supersymmetry, with unique and challenging collider phenomenology. In order to study the MUED model, it was implemented in the fortran version PYTHIA6 general purpose event generator from version 6.4.18 onwards. The MUED model is not available in the C++ version of PYTHIA8.
   Solution method: The new implementation validates and fixes the backward compatibility and some issues in the current PYTHIA6 version. The model has now been implemented in the PYTHIA8 event generator. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Enzymes, as paramount protein catalysts, occupy a central role in fostering remarkable progress across numerous fields. However, the intricacy of sequence-function relationships continues to obscure our grasp of enzyme behaviors and curtails our capabilities in rational enzyme engineering. Generative artificial intelligence (AI), known for its proficiency in handling intricate data distributions, holds the potential to offer novel perspectives in enzyme research. Generative models could discern elusive patterns within the vast sequence space and uncover new functional enzyme sequences. This review highlights the recent advancements in employing generative AI for enzyme sequence analysis. We delve into the impact of generative AI in predicting mutation effects on enzyme fitness, catalytic activity and stability, rationalizing the laboratory evolution of de novo enzymes, and decoding protein sequence semantics and their application in enzyme engineering. Notably, the prediction of catalytic activity and stability of enzymes using natural protein sequences serves as a vital link, indicating how enzyme catalysis shapes enzyme evolution. Overall, we foresee that the integration of generative AI into enzyme studies will remarkably enhance our knowledge of enzymes and expedite the creation of superior biocatalysts.
   This Review underscores the latest advances in applying generative AI to the analysis of enzyme sequences, which has deepened our insight into enzyme evolution and catalysis, thereby advancing enzyme engineering.

AB Mosquito repellency data on acylpiperidines derived from the U.S. Department of Agriculture archives were modeled by using molecular descriptors calculated by CODESSA PRO software. An artificial neural network model was developed for the correlation of these archival results and used to predict the repellent activity of novel compounds of similar structures. A series of 34 promising N-acylpiperidine mosquito repellent candidates (4a-4q') were synthesized by reactions of acylbenzotriazoles 2a-2p with piperidines 3a-3f. Compounds (4a-4q') were screened as topically applied mosquito repellents by measuring the duration of repellency after application to cloth patches worn on the arms of human volunteers. Some compounds that were evaluated repelled mosquitoes as much as three times longer than N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), the most widely used repellent throughout the world. The newly measured durations of repellency were used to obtain a superior correlation equation relating mosquito repellency to molecular structure.

ID DATA-DRIVEN; TUTORIAL
AB Prognostics methods model the degradation of system performance and predict remaining useful life using degradation data measured during service. However, obtaining degradation data from in-service systems in practice is either difficult or expensive. Therefore, accelerated life testing (ALT) is instead frequently performed for validating designs using considerably heavy loads. This work discusses the methods and effectiveness of utilizing ALT degradation data for the prognostics of a system. Depending on the degradation model and loading conditions, four different ways of utilizing ALT data for prognostics are discussed. A similar transformation method used in ALT is adopted to convert accelerated loading conditions to field loading conditions. To demonstrate the proposed approach, synthetic data are generated for crack growth under accelerated loading conditions; these data are used for training a neural network model or identifying model parameters in a particle filter. The applied example shows that the use of ALT data increases the accuracy of prognostics in the early stages in all four cases and compensates for the problem posed by data insufficiency through the proposed method.

DE Cardia gastric cancer; Precancerous lesions; Serological markers;
   Proteomics; Machine learning
AB Cardia gastric cancer (CGC) is prevalent in East Asia, and noninvasive, cost-effective screening methods are needed. This study investigated the diagnostic value of serum pepsinogen (PG), gastrin-17 (G-17), Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) antibodies, and proteomic profiling for CGC and precancerous lesions. We conducted a case-control study involving biopsy-confirmed patients with CGC (n = 60), low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (CLGD, n = 60), high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (CHGD, n = 64), and healthy controls (n = 120) matched for age and sex from high-incidence areas in China. Serological markers including PGI, PGII, G-17, and H. pylori were measured using ELISA and Western blot, while plasma protein markers were assessed using Olink (R) technology. The VSOLassoBag algorithm and nine machine learning (ML) algorithms were employed to identify crucial features and construct predictive models. Various evaluation metrics, including the area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC), were utilized to compare predictive performance. Elevated PGII levels, decreased PGR, and H. pylori infection were significantly associated with an increased risk of CGC and precancerous lesions (P for trend < 0.05). The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model performed best in discriminative ability among the 9 ML models. Following feature reduction based on predictive performance, a final explainable XGBoost model was developed, incorporating five protein biomarkers (CDHR2, ICAM4, PTPRM, CDC27, and FLT1). This model exhibited excellent performance in distinguishing individuals with CGC and precancerous lesions from healthy controls (AUC = 0.931 for CGC, 0.867 for CHGD, and 0.763 for CLGD), surpassing the traditional serological marker-based model. This study underscores the diagnostic potential of serological markers and proteomic profiling in the detection of CGC. Further validation and exploration of combined biomarker approaches are warranted to enhance early diagnosis and improve outcomes in high-risk populations.

AB This paper presents a search for generic short-duration gravitational-wave (GW) transients (or GW bursts) in the data from the third observing run of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo. We use a coherent WaveBurst (cWB) pipeline enhanced with a decision-tree classification algorithm for more efficient separation of GW signals from noise transients. The machine-learning (ML) algorithm is trained on a representative set of noise events and a set of simulated stochastic signals that are not correlated with any known signal model. This training procedure preserves the model-independent nature of the search. We demonstrate that the ML-enhanced cWB pipeline can detect GW signals at a larger distance than previous model-independent searches. The sensitivity improvements are achieved across the broad spectrum of simulated signals, with the goal of testing the robustness of this model-agnostic search. At a false-alarm rate of one event per century, the detectable signal amplitudes are reduced up to almost an order of magnitude, most notably for the single-cycle signal morphologies. This ML-enhanced pipeline also improves the detection efficiency of compact binary mergers in a wide range of masses, from stellar mass to intermediate-mass black holes, both with circular and elliptical orbits. After excluding previously detected compact binaries, no new gravitational-wave signals are observed for the twofold Hanford-Livingston and the threefold Hanford-Livingston-Virgo detector networks. With the improved sensitivity of the all-sky search, we obtain the most stringent constraints on the isotropic emission of gravitational-wave energy from short-duration burst sources.

AB Background Depression is a highly common and recurrent condition. Predicting who is at most risk of relapse or recurrence can inform clinical practice. Applying machine-learning methods to Individual Participant Data (IPD) can be promising to improve the accuracy of risk predictions.
   Methods Individual data of four Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) evaluating antidepressant treatment compared to psychological interventions with tapering (N = 714) were used to identify predictors of relapse and/or recurrence. Ten baseline predictors were assessed. Decision trees with and without gradient boosting were applied. To study the robustness of decision-tree classifications, we also performed a complementary logistic regression analysis.
   Results The combination of age, age of onset of depression, and depression severity significantly enhances the prediction of relapse risk when compared to classifiers solely based on depression severity. The studied decision trees can (i) identify relapse patients at intake with an accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of about 55% (without gradient boosting) and 58% (with gradient boosting), and (ii) slightly outperform classifiers that are based on logistic regression.
   Conclusions Decision tree classifiers based on multiple-rather than single-risk indicators may be useful for developing treatment stratification strategies. These classification models have the potential to contribute to the development of methods aimed at effectively prioritizing treatment for those individuals who require it the most. Our results also underline the existing gaps in understanding how to accurately predict depressive relapse.

AB Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (Map), the etiological agent of Johne's disease in ruminants, poses challenges to veterinary health and food safety. Despite an immune response that partially controls early infection, Map persists in macrophages through mechanisms not well understood. Here, we explored how the Map major membrane protein (MMP) modulates immune pathways in bovine monocyte-derived macrophages (MoM Phi s). MMP is a key component of the bacterial cell membrane recognized in cattle with Johne's disease, making it a critical antigenic target for immune studies. Using high-resolution transcriptomics, we identified that MMP stimulation rapidly activates genes linked to pro-inflammatory cytokine signaling, antigen processing, and presentation via MHC I and II pathways. Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses highlighted upregulation of TNF, IL-17, and NF-kappa B signaling cascades, suggesting an immune signaling that may foster cytotoxic T cell development. Phosphorylation assays confirmed that MMP triggers MAPK activation within minutes, implicating both p38 and JNK1/2 in early macrophage responses. Machine learning approaches revealed subtle yet significant MMP-specific gene signatures including ATG5 and ATG12, implicated in autophagosome assembly. These findings point to a dynamic interplay between antibacterial autophagy and immunostimulatory pathways elicited by MMP in bovine macrophages. Importantly, our results suggest the relevance of MMP as a potential vaccine target, as it not only elicits immune-activating signals but also engages host defenses critical to restricting Map survival. Overall, this work provides an ex vivo framework for delineating the molecular underpinnings of Map infection, offering new insights into macrophage-based immunity and informing development of novel therapeutic and prophylactic strategies against paratuberculosis.

TI Using ChatGPT to predict the future of personalized medicine
SO PHARMACOGENOMICS JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Personalized medicine is a novel frontier in health care that is based on each person's unique genetic makeup. It represents an exciting opportunity to improve the future of individualized health care for all individuals. Pharmacogenomics, as the main part of personalized medicine, aims to optimize and create a more targeted treatment approach based on genetic variations in drug response. It is predicted that future treatments will be algorithm-based instead of evidence-based that will consider a patient's genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, epigenetic, and lifestyle factors resulting in individualized medication. A generative pretrained transformer (GPT) is an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that generates language resembling human-like writing enabling users to engage in a manner that is practically identical to speaking with a human being. GPT's predictive algorithms can respond to questions that have never been addressed. Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer (ChatGPT) is an AI chatbot's advanced with conversational capabilities. In the present study, questions were asked from ChatGPT about the future of personalized medicine and pharmacogenomics. ChatGPT predicted both to be a promising approach with a bright future that holds great promises in improving patient outcomes and transforming the field of medicine. But it still has several limitations that need to be solved.

AB Drought forecasting can aid in developing mitigation strategies and minimizing economic losses. Drought may be forecast using a drought index, which is an indicator of drought. The agricultural reference index for drought (ARID) was used as a tool to investigate the possibility of using climate indices (CIs) as predictors to improve the current level of forecasting, which is El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) based. The performances of models that are based on linear regression (LR), artificial neural networks (ANN), adaptive neuron-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS), and autoregressive moving averages (ARMA) models were compared with that of the ENSO approach. Monthly values of ARID spanning 56 yr were computed for five locations in the southeastern United States, and monthly values of the CIs having significant connections with weather in this region were obtained. For the ENSO approach, the ARID values were separated into three ENSO phases and averaged by phase. For the ARMA models, monthly time series of ARID were used. For the ANFIS, ANN, and LR models, ARID was predicted 1, 2, and 3 months ahead using the past values of the first principal component of the CIs. Model performances were assessed with the Nash-Sutcliffe index. Results indicated that drought forecasting could be improved for the southern part of the region using ANN models and CIs. The ANN outperformed the other models for most locations in the region. The CI-based models and the ENSO approach performed better during the winter, whereas the efficiency of ARMA models depended on precipitation periodicities. All models performed better for southern locations. The CIs showed good potential for use in forecasting drought, especially for southern locations in the winter.

AB Forecasting can be utilized to predict future trends in physiological demands, which can be beneficial for developing effective interventions. This study implemented forecasting models to predict fatigue level progression when performing exoskeleton (EXO)-assisted tasks. Specifically, perceived and muscle activity data were utilized from nine recruited participants who performed 45 degrees trunk flexion tasks intermittently with and without assistance until they reached medium-high exertion in the low-back region. Two forecasting algorithms, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Facebook Prophet, were implemented using perceived fatigue levels alone, and with external features of low-back muscle activity. Findings showed that univariate models without external features performed better with the Prophet model having the lowest mean (SD) of root mean squared error (RMSE) across participants of 0.62 (0.24) and 0.67 (0.29) with and without EXO-assisted tasks, respectively. Temporal effects of BSIE on delaying fatigue progression were then evaluated by forecasting back fatigue up to 20 trials. The slope of fatigue progression for 20 trials without assistance was similar to 48-52% higher vs. with assistance. Median benefits of 54% and 43% were observed for ARIMA (with external features) and Prophet algorithms, respectively. This study demonstrates some potential applications for forecasting models for workforce health monitoring, intervention assessment, and injury prevention.

AB We simultaneously recorded local field potentials from three sites along the olfactory-entorhinal axis in rats lightly anesthetized with isoflurane, as part of another experiment. While analyzing the initial data from that experiment with spectrograms, we discovered a potentially novel form of correlated neural activity, with near-simultaneous occurrence across the three widely separated brain sites. After validating their existence further, we named these events Synchronous Frequency Bursts (SFBs). Here we report our initial investigations into their properties and their potential functional significance. In Experiment 1, we found that SFBs have highly regular properties, consisting of brief (similar to 250 ms), high amplitude bursts of LFP energy spanning frequency ranges from the delta band (1-4 Hz) to at least the low gamma band (30-50 Hz). SFBs occurred almost simultaneously across recording sites, usually with onsets < 25 ms apart, and there was no clear pattern of temporal leading or lagging among the sites. While the SFBs had fairly typical, exponentially decaying power spectral density plots, their coherence structure was unusual, with high peaks in several narrow frequency ranges and little coherence in other bands. In Experiment 2, we found that SFBs occurred far more often under light anesthesia than deeper anesthetic states, and were especially prevalent as the animals regained consciousness. Finally, in Experiment 3 we showed that SFBs occur simultaneously at a significant rate across brain sites from putatively different functional subsystems-olfactory versus motor pathways. We suggest that SFBs do not carry information per se, but rather, play a role in coordinating activity in different frequency bands, potentially brain-wide, as animals progress from sleep or anesthesia toward full consciousness.

AB Healthcare systems are capable of collecting a significant number of patient health-related parameters. Analyzing them to find the reasons that cause a given disease is challenging. Feature Selection techniques have been used to address this issue-reducing these parameters to a smaller set with the most "determinant" information. However, existing proposals usually focus on classification problems-aimed to detect whether a person is or is not suffering from an illness or from a finite set of illnesses. However, there are many situations in which health professionals need a numerical assessment to quantify the severity of an illness, thus dealing with a regression problem instead. Proposals using Feature Selection here are very limited. This paper examines several Feature Selection techniques to gauge their applicability to the regression-type problems, comparing these techniques by applying them to a real-life scenario on the functional profiles of older adults. Data from829 functional profiles assessments in 49 residential homes were used in this study. The number of features was reduced from 31 to 25-with a correlation between inputs and outputs of 0.99 according to the R-2 score and a Mean Square Error (MSE) of 0.11-or to 14 features-with a correlation of 0.98 and MSE of 5.73.

AB In this work, we propose a natural model for information flow in the brain through a neural message-passing dynamics on a structural network of macroscopic regions, such as the human connectome (HC). In our model, each brain region is assumed to have a binary behavior (active or not), the strengths of interactions among them are encoded in the anatomical connectivity matrix defined by the HC, and the dynamics of the system is defined by the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm, working near the critical point of the network. We show that in the absence of direct external stimuli the BP algorithm converges to a spatial map of activations that is similar to the Default Mode Network (DMN) of the brain, which has been defined from the analysis of functional MRI data. Moreover, we use Susceptibility Propagation (SP) to compute the matrix of long-range correlations between the different regions and show that the modules defined by a clustering of this matrix resemble several Resting State Networks (RSN) determined experimentally. Both results suggest that the functional DMN and RSNs can be seen as simple consequences of the anatomical structure of the brain and a neural message-passing dynamics between macroscopic regions. With the new model, we explore predictions on how functional maps change when the anatomical brain network suffers structural alterations, like in Alzheimer's disease and in lesions of the Corpus Callosum. The implications and novel interpretations suggested by the model, as well as the role of criticality, are discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In particular, the intertwined influences of short-term TRP and Spring Festival remains unclear. Based on Beijing 2022 Olympic Games, this study analyzed the spatiotemporal changes in urban air quality and diesel vehicle emission during short-term TRP. The results showed that the TRPs and Spring Festival contributed equally to the improvement of air quality and reduction of diesel vehicle emissions. The "interruption-recovery" pattern of short-term TRPs is characterized by a longer duration and a slower decline/recovery rate. Additionally, the individual contribution rate of diesel vehicle emissions to urban air pollutants was 15-20 % higher than that of meteorological factors during short-term TRPs.

AB Introduction: Drawing on the seminal work of DeLong, Albin, and Young, we have now entered an era of basal ganglia neuromodulation. Understanding, re-evaluating, and leveraging the lessons learned from neuromodulation will be crucial to facilitate an increased and improved application of neuromodulation in human disease.
   Methods: We will focus on deep brain stimulation (DBS) - the most common form of basal ganglia neuromodulation however, similar principles can apply to other neuromodulation modalities. We start with a brief review of DBS for Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, dystonia, and Tourette syndrome. We then review hallmark studies on basal ganglia circuits and electrophysiology resulting from decades of experience in neuromodulation. The organization and content of this paper follow Dr. Okun's Lecture from the 2018 Parkinsonism and Related Disorders World Congress.
   Results: Information gained from neuromodulation has led to an expansion of the basal ganglia rate model, an enhanced understanding of nuclei dynamics, an emerging focus on pathological oscillations, a revision of the tripartite division of the basal ganglia, and a redirected focus toward individualized symptom-specific stimulation. Though there have been many limitations of the basal ganglia "box model," the construct provided the necessary foundation to advance the field. We now understand that information in the basal ganglia is encoded through complex neural responses that can be reliably measured and used to infer disease states for clinical translation.
   Conclusions: Our deepened understanding of basal ganglia physiology will drive new neuromodulation strategies such as adaptive DBS or cell-specific neuromodulation through the use of optogenetics.

AB This paper addresses target discrimination ire synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery using linear and nonlinear adaptive networks, Neural networks are extensively used for pattern classification brat here the goal is discrimination, We will show that the two applications require different cost functions. We start by analyzing with a pattern recognition perspective the two-parameter constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector which is widely utilized as a target detector in SAR, Then we generalize its principle to construct the quadratic gamma discriminator (QGD), a nonparametrically trained classifier based ore local image intensity, The linear processing element of the QGD is further extended with nonlinearities yielding a multilayer perceptron (MLP) which we call the NL-QGD (nonlinear QGD).
   MLP's are normally trained based on the L-2 norm. We experimentally show that the L-2 norm is not recommended to train MLP's for discriminating targets in SAR, Inspired by the Neyman-Pearson criterion, we create a case function based on a mixed norm to weight the false alarms and the missed detections differently, Mixed norms can easily be incorporated into the backpropagation algorithm, and lead to better performance, Several other norms (L-8, cross-entropy) are applied to train the NL-QGD and all outperformed the L-2 norm when validated by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves. The data sets are constructed from TABILS 24 ISAR targets embedded in 7 km(2) of SAR imagery (MIT/LL, mission 90).

AB The conservation of species should be based on knowledge of habitat requirements, population structure and conservation status. This knowledge is quite important to design conservation areas for species and to promote long-term persistence. In this study, we investigated habitat suitability, population size structure and conservation status of Pinanga arinasae in Bali. Plots with palms and adjacent areas with no palms were sampled to characterize key habitat variables. Habitat suitability was modeled using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Random Forest (RF) methods. The population size structure was characterized by counting and measuring the height and reproductive status of the individuals found in plots. Furthermore, we assessed the extinction risk of the species using the IUCN Red List Criteria. The ANN variables that best explained occurrence were litter depth, elevation, canopy openness and slope. The RF variables that best explained the data were elevation, litter depth, slope, and aspect. Both ANN and RF are robust models that can be used to predict the occurrence of P. arinasae. The population size structure included many seedlings, but juvenile and mature individuals were found in relatively small numbers. Based on the findings, we proposed Endangered B1+B2ab(i,ii,iii,v); D as the conservation status of P. arinasae.

AB Growing evidence of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) modulating intrinsic neural oscillations has spawned interest in applying tACS to treat psychiatric disorders associated with aberrant neural oscillations. The alpha rhythmic activity is known to dominate neural oscillations at the awake, restful state, while attenuated resting-state alpha activity has been implicated in anxious mood. Administering repeated alpha-frequency tACS (alpha-tACS; at individual peak alpha frequency; 8-12 Hz) over four consecutive days (in the experiment group, sham stimulation in the control group), we demonstrated immediate and lasting (>24 h) increases in resting-state posterior -> frontal connectivity in the alpha frequency, quantified by Granger causality. Critically, this connectivity enhancement was accompanied by sustained reductions in both anxious arousal and negative perception of sensory stimuli. Resting-state alpha power also increased, albeit only transiently, reversing to the baseline level within 24 h after tACS. Therefore, the lasting enhancement of long-range alpha connectivity due to alpha-tACS differs from local alpha activity that is nonetheless conserved, highlighting the adaptability of alpha oscillatory networks. In light of increasing recognition of large-scale network dysfunctions as a transdiagnostic pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders, this enduring connectivity plasticity, along with the behavioral improvements, paves the way for tACS applications in clinical interventions of psychiatric 'oscillopathies'.

AB Background: There is remarkable heterogeneity in clinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) or vascular dementia (VaD).
   Objectives: 1) To statistically examine neuropsychological data to determine dementia subgroups for individuals clinically diagnosed with AD or VaD and then 2) examine group differences in specific gray/white matter regions of interest.
   Methods: A k-means cluster analysis requested a 3-group solution from neuropsychological data acquired from individuals diagnosed clinically with AD/VaD. MRI measures of hippocampal, caudate, ventricular, subcortical lacunar infarction, whole brain volume, and leukoaraiosis (LA) were analyzed. Three regions of LA volumes were quantified and these included the periventricular (5mm around the ventricles), infracortical (5mm beneath the gray matter), and deep (between periventricular and infracortical) regions.
   Results: Cluster analysis sorted AD/VaD patients into single domain amnestic (n = 41), single-domain dysexecutive (n = 26), and multi-domain (n = 26) phenotypes. Multi-domain patients exhibited worst performance on language tests; however, multidomain patients were equally impaired on memory tests when compared to amnestic patients. Statistically-determined groups dissociated using neuroradiological parameters: amnestic and multi-domain groups presented with smaller hippocampal volume while the dysexecutive group presented with greater deep, periventricular, and whole brain LA. Neither caudate nor lacunae volume differed by group. Caudate nucleus volume negatively correlated with total LA in the dysexecutive and multi-domain groups.
   Conclusions: There are at least three distinct subtypes embedded within patients diagnosed clinically with AD/VaD spectrum dementia. We encourage future research to assess a) the neuroradiological substrates underlying statistically-determined AD/VaD spectrum dementia and b) how statistical modeling can be integrated into existing diagnostic criteria.

AB Early and accurate disease detection is essential for implementing timely disease management practices. Current disease detection tactics, like visual detection through scouting, are labor intensive, expensive, requires a level of expertise in pest identification, and, may result in subjective disease identification. Diagnosis based on visual symptoms is often compromised by the inability to differentiate between similar symptoms caused by different biotic and abiotic factors. In this paper, an automated early disease detection technique for avocado trees is presented and evaluated. This remote sensing technique can detect an important avocado disease, the laurel wilt (Lw) disease, and differentiate it from healthy trees (H), trees infected by phytophthora root rot (Prr), and trees with iron (Fe) and nitrogen (N) deficiencies. Detection of Lw disease in avocado trees, in early stage, is very difficult, because it has similar symptoms with other stress factors such as nutrient deficiency, salt damage, phytophthora root rot, etc. The proposed disease detection procedure contains several steps including image acquisition, image pre-processing, image segmentation, feature extraction and classification. For image acquisition, two cameras were utilized and evaluated: (i) a Tetracamera (6 bands Tetracam) and (ii) a modified Canon camera (3 bands); and two classification methods were studied: (a) neural network multilayer perceptron (MLP), and (ii) K- nearest neighbors, to detect Lw in asymptomatic stage and in late (symptomatic) stage. Additionally, two segmentation methods, region of interest (OVROI) and polygon region of interest (PROI), were utilized. The MLP classification method with the Tetracam was able to successfully detect Lw with an accuracy of 99% in asymptomatic (early) stage. Hence, low-cost remote technique can be utilized to differentiate healthy and unhealthy plants.

ID BIAS
AB Population growth, rapid urbanization, epidemics, political instability, and resource constraints are contributing to disruptions in food supplies, while farm labor shortages, increasing input costs, disease and pest pressure, and federal regulations further reduce food security. The convergence of recent scientific (e.g., genomics) and engineering (e.g., smart sensors, robotics, artificial intelligence) technologies in agriculture have the potential to create more efficient, productive, sustainable, and resilient food systems. Yet, this fusion of agricultural practices with modern, information -based technologies requires a trained workforce that includes engineers, scientists, and production personnel to develop and apply solutions to address critical challenges in agriculture and natural resources. In response to these needs and discussions amongst experts in the field, faculty in the Agricultural and Biological Engineering (ABE) Department at the University of Florida developed two graduate certificates to provide specialized training for students interested in technical careers in agriculture. The ABE faculty have expertise in the application of innovative technology in agricultural and food systems and are uniquely positioned to develop curricula for broader audiences in engineering and agricultural sciences. These smart agriculture (SmartAg) certificates provide students with a curated sequence of required courses in addition to elective courses in an area of their interest. Students in the Engineered SmartAg Certificate (Eng_SmartAg) design, integrate, and implement hardware and software solutions, while science students in the Applied Methods for SmartAg Systems (App_SmartAg), including operators, managers, and technologists, apply solutions from existing systems and components. This article presents the curriculum and certificate development processes in different stages. We start with motivations, program needs, and highlight key discussions amongst experts in the agricultural engineering field that led to the conceptualization of the certificates. Next, we discuss two new integral courses that were developed for each certificate and describe course objectives, curriculum maps, projects, and key assessments. We then describe the process for certificate program assessment, detailing their program missions, alignment, goals, and student learning outcomes, as well as assessment plans and approaches to course evaluation and program improvement. We summarize feedback provided by students enrolled in the first cohorts of these courses and discuss changes and revisions to facilitate student learning opportunities, improve instructional effectiveness, and strengthen the courses and certificates. Finally, we discuss the early challenges in launching both certificates and future plans to market, advertise, and attract students and professionals from different engineering disciplines and agricultural backgrounds interested in agriculture and food system innovations.

ID CONTEXT
AB Due to the overwhelming volume of information that is increasingly available, many people rely on current awareness systems to keep abreast of the latest developments in the fields that they are interested in, as evidenced in the popularity of subscriptions to news-monitoring and digital library services. The success of these services, however, often requires effective acquisition of users' personal standing interests as represented in personal profiles. Our objective in this paper is twofold. First, we have introduced a new method for profile generation and compared it against other well-known methods. We have found promising results. Second, although there are various methods proposed in information retrieval and machine learning literature to address the issue of profiling, a unified framework and systematic cross-system comparison to help users, especially service providers, to determine the most effective way of profiling consumers is still lacking in the literature. In this paper, we try to fill the gap by looking at these methods from a more integrated point of view based on statistical contingency theory. Variations of these methods are then systematically tested on three well-known routing systems and results are analyzed and reported. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Burmese pythons (Python bivittatus) have demonstrated prolific spread and low detectability within their invasive range in Florida, USA. Consequently, programs exist which incentivize contractors to remove pythons. While surveying, contractors collect data on search effort and python captures. We examined data from South Florida Water Management District's Python Elimination Program to determine the effect of operational and environmental covariates on two measures of survey outcome: success (i.e., probability of removing at least one python) and efficiency (i.e., the number of pythons removed per survey hour). Additionally, we assessed the spatial distribution of contractor search effort and removals. Warm temperatures (> 25 degrees C) improve survey outcomes, especially when surveys occur late at night and during the wet season (May-Oct). The most efficient interval for conducting surveys occurs from 20:00 to 02:00. The spatial distribution of python removals is concentrated in four regions and coincides with contractor search effort. Our results provide insights into optimizing removal efforts for invasive Burmese pythons in Florida, which may allow for increases in removal efficiency. Moreover, this study demonstrates that community science data can be used to synthesize recommendations for invasive species removal efforts.

AB The role of osmolality of contrast media (CM) in the development of post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) is debated. We therefore performed a metanalysis to determine whether osmolality affects the incidence of PEP. A literature search of English-language studies was performed using computerized databases and manual searching of abstracts and article bibliographies. Randomized controlled trials comparing the incidence of PEP associated with high- and low-osmolality contrast media (HOCM, LOCM) were considered. The outcome assessed was clinical pancreatitis as evidenced by both elevation of pancreatic enzymes and pain. Data were analyzed using logistic regression with terms for study and osmolality. Fisher's exact test was done to compare PEP rates. Homogeneity between studies was indicated by the nonsignificance of the study effect in the logistic regression model. Logistic regression also indicated no difference in PEP rates between LOCM and HOCM (P=0.399). Comparison of PEP rates in both groups using Fisher's exact test did not indicate a difference in any individual study (all P values >0.05). Due to the large variation of study sample sizes, we repeated the analysis by creating three study groups. The effect of osmolality was invariant to how the data were combined. The results of this metanalysis indicate that there is no significant difference between HOCM and LOCM with respect to clinical PEP.

AB The phonomotor treatment program for treating word-retrieval deficits among people with aphasia is inspired by a parallel distributed processing model of lexical processing and is focused at the level of individual phonemes and phoneme sequences. Because verbal production of words involves the translation of a lexical-semantic representation into phonological representations, training the repertoire of phonological sequences should enable individuals with anomia to regain the ability to learn words and sequences, generalize to linguistic items not trained, and continue growth following treatment termination. The development and refinement of the phonomotor treatment program, which began in 2000, have followed the 5-phase model for communication disorders and sciences framework outlined by R. Robey (2004). To date, there have been 8 published articles on the phonomotor treatment program. A large-scale randomized trial comparing phonomotor with standard of care for word-retrieval deficits is underway. The goal of this article is to review the theoretical framework, treatment procedures, current evidence, and future directions of the phonomotor protocol.

AB PurposeClinical decision support tools (CDSTs) are software that generate patient-specific assessments that can be used to better inform healthcare provider decision making. Machine learning (ML)-based CDSTs have recently been developed for anatomic (aTSA) and reverse (rTSA) total shoulder arthroplasty to facilitate more data-driven, evidence-based decision making. Using this shoulder CDST as an example, this external validation study provides an overview of how ML-based algorithms are developed and discusses the limitations of these tools.MethodsAn external validation for a novel CDST was conducted on 243 patients (120F/123M) who received a personalized prediction prior to surgery and had short-term clinical follow-up from 3 months to 2 years after primary aTSA (n = 43) or rTSA (n = 200). The outcome score and active range of motion predictions were compared to each patient's actual result at each timepoint, with the accuracy quantified by the mean absolute error (MAE).ResultsThe results of this external validation demonstrate the CDST accuracy to be similar (within 10%) or better than the MAEs from the published internal validation. A few predictive models were observed to have substantially lower MAEs than the internal validation, specifically, Constant (31.6% better), active abduction (22.5% better), global shoulder function (20.0% better), active external rotation (19.0% better), and active forward elevation (16.2% better), which is encouraging; however, the sample size was small.ConclusionA greater understanding of the limitations of ML-based CDSTs will facilitate more responsible use and build trust and confidence, potentially leading to greater adoption. As CDSTs evolve, we anticipate greater shared decision making between the patient and surgeon with the aim of achieving even better outcomes and greater levels of patient satisfaction.

AB The central executive system (CES) may be the most fundamental yet least understood component of working memory. There is an ongoing debate about which brain regions underlie the top-down regulation of CES during working memory tasks. The neural substrates and regulatory mechanisms of CES remain controversial partly because few previous studies have been focused on comprehensive activation and deactivation joint analysis on all systems involved in all working memory stages, which have shown increasing importance in depicting the neural configuration of working memory. To address these questions, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging study using a comprehensive activation-deactivation-behavior joint analysis to examine the dynamics of a set of cortical systems in healthy subjects performing a modified Sternberg working memory task which was designed to push the subjects to their limit in working memory and to introduce strong demands for regulation by CES. We assessed brain activity during various working memory stages using general linear model and single trial-stage estimation, and examined the relationship between the single trial-stage activity and behavioral performance. We identified constant activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula in all working memory stages and its relationship with performance, which indicate the CES's neural basis. We also identified dynamic configuration of multiple downstream systems in different working memory stages, which indicates the regulation mechanism of CES. (C) 2018 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Six new NDES (#1-6) were designed to extract polyphenols in olive leaves in comparison to 7 previously reported ones (#7-13) including aqueous 75 % ethanol. Artificial neural net-working (ANN) was used to model the extraction parameters and predict the extraction yield. Twelve phenolic compounds were identified and quantified in leaf extract using HPLC-MS. NDES #3 extracted the highest yield of rutin (4.84 mg/g), luteolin 7-O-glucoside (8.36 mg/g), luteolin 4 '-O-glucoside (5.42 mg/g), luteolin (23.10 mg/g), apigenin (0.52 mg/g), and chrysoeriol (0.32 mg/g). NDES #4 extracted higher amount of flavones and rutin from the olive leaves than 75 % ethanol. NDES #10 showed selectivity to extracted hydro-xytyrosol. The ANN optimization of the extraction parameters using NDES #3 increased the summed yield of flavones and rutin. This study demonstrated that newly designed NDES are more effective than previous ones and 75 % ethanol to extract major phenolic compounds in olive leaves.(c) 2023 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB This paper investigates an integrated production and assembly scheduling problem with the practical manufacturing features of serial batching and the effects of deteriorating and learning. The problem is divided into two stages. During the production stage, there are several semi-product manufacturers who first produce ordered product components in batches, and then these processed components are sent to an assembly manufacturer. During the assembly stage, the assembly manufacturer will further process them on multiple assembly machines, where the product components are assembled into final products. Through mathematical induction, we characterize the structures of the optimal decision rules for the scheduling problem during the production stage, and a scheme is developed to solve this scheduling problem optimally based on the structural properties. Some useful lemmas are proposed for the scheduling problem during the assembly stage, and a heuristic algorithm is developed to eliminate the inappropriate schedules and enhance the solution quality. We then prove that the investigated problem is NP-hard. Motivated by this complexity result, we present a less-is-more-approach-based variable neighborhood search heuristic to obtain the approximately optimal solution for the problem. The computational experiments indicate that our designed LIMA-VNS (less is more approach-variable neighborhood search) has an advantage over other metaheuristics in terms of converge speed, solution quality, and robustness, especially for large-scale problems.

AB RNA structure plays a role in nearly every disease. Therefore, approaches that identify tractable small molecule chemical matter that targets RNA and affects its function would transform drug discovery. Despite this potential, discovery of RNA-targeted small molecule chemical probes and medicines remains in its infancy. Advances in RNA-focused libraries are key to enable more successful primary screens and to define structure-activity relationships amongst hit molecules. In this review, we describe how RNA-focused small molecule libraries have been used and evolved over time and provide underlying principles for their application to develop bioactive small molecules. We also describe areas that need further investigation to advance the field, including generation of larger data sets to inform machine learning approaches.

AB The lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) plays an important role in the neural networks involved in intertemporal choice. However, little is known about how the neural oscillation of LPFC functions during intertemporal choice, owing to the technical limitations of functional magnetic resonance imaging and event-related brain potential recordings. Electrocorticography (ECoG) is a novel neuroimaging technique that has high spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we used ECoG and projected the ECoG data onto individual brain spaces to investigate human intracranial cortex activity and how neural oscillations of the LPFC impact intertemporal choice. We found that neural activity of theta oscillation was significantly higher during impulsive decisions, while beta oscillation activity was significantly higher during non-impulsive ones. Our findings suggest a functional dissociation between cortical theta and beta oscillations during decision-making processes involved in intertemporal choice, and that decision outcomes may be determined by LPFC modulation, which involves neural oscillations at different frequencies.

AB Scattering measurements using electrons, neutrons, or photons are essential for obtaining microscopic insights into materials. However, limited facility availability and high-dimensional scattering data necessitate more efficient experimental steering techniques. Here, we report a machine learning method that guides scattering data collection and facilitates real-time estimation of model parameters, given a reliable forward model to simulate experimental signals. We employ implicit neural representations as efficient surrogates that link model parameters with simulated spectroscopies. This enables a Bayesian optimal experimental design framework to estimate the probability distributions of parameters from high-dimensional scattering data. We demonstrate the proposed method using inelastic neutron scattering with simulated and real experimental data, highlighting the method's ability to provide real-time parameter estimation with quantified uncertainties and to deliver informed experimental guidance that reduces experimental time while maximizing scientific output. This approach paves the way for accelerated discoveries in condensed matter through scattering measurements.

AB Forests provide biodiversity, ecosystem, and economic services. Information on individual trees is important for understanding forest ecosystems but obtaining individual-level data at broad scales is challenging due to the costs and logistics of data collection. While advances in remote sensing techniques allow surveys of individual trees at unprecedented extents, there remain technical challenges in turning sensor data into tangible information. Using deep learning methods, we produced an open-source data set of individual-level crown estimates for 100 million trees at 37 sites across the United States surveyed by the National Ecological Observatory Network's Airborne Observation Platform. Each canopy tree crown is represented by a rectangular bounding box and includes information on the height, crown area, and spatial location of the tree. These data have the potential to drive significant expansion of individual-level research on trees by facilitating both regional analyses and cross-region comparisons encompassing forest types from most of the United States.

AB Accurate counting of plants and their organs in natural environments is essential for breeders and growers. For breeders, counting plants during the seedling stage aids in selecting genotypes with superior emergence rates, while for growers, it informs decisions about potential replanting. Meanwhile, counting specific plant organs, such as flowers, forecasts yields for different genotypes, offering insights into production levels. The overall goal of this study was to investigate a deep convolutional neural network-based tracking method, CenterTrack, for cotton seedling and flower counting from video frames. The network is extended from a customized CenterNet, which is an anchor-free object detector. CenterTrack predicts the detections of the current frame and displacements of detections between the previous frame and the current frame, which are used to associate the same object in consecutive frames. The modified CenterNet detector achieved high accuracy on both seedling and flower datasets with an overall AP50 of 0.962. The video tracking hyperparameters were optimized for each dataset using orthogonal tests. Experimental results showed that seedling and flower counts with optimized hyperparameters highly correlated with those of manual counts (R2 = 0.98 andR2 = 0.95) and the mean relative errors of 75 cotton seedling testing videos and 50 flower testing videos were 5.5 % and 10.8 %, respectively. An average counting speed of 20.4 frames per second was achieved with an input resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels for both seedling and flower videos. The anchor-free deep convolution neural network-based tracking method provides automatic tracking and counting in video frames, which will significantly benefit plant breeding and crop management.

AB Despite the usefulness of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in the study of various complex problems, ANNs have not been applied for modeling the geographic distribution of tuberculosis (TB) in the US. Likewise, ecological level researches on TB incidence rate at the national level are inadequate for epidemiologic inferences. We collected 278 exploratory variables including environmental and a broad range of socio-economic features for modeling the disease across the continental US. The spatial pattern of the disease distribution was statistically evaluated using the global Moran's I, Getis-Ord General G, and local Gi* statistics. Next, we investigated the applicability of multilayer perceptron (MLP) ANN for predicting the disease incidence. To avoid overfitting, L1 regularization was used before developing the models. Predictive performance of the MLP was compared with linear regression for test dataset using root mean square error, mean absolute error, and correlations between model output and ground truth. Results of clustering analysis showed that there is a significant spatial clustering of smoothed TB incidence rate (p < 0.05) and the hotspots were mainly located in the southern and southeastern parts of the country. Among the developed models, single hidden layer MLP had the best test accuracy. Sensitivity analysis of the MLP model showed that immigrant population (proportion), underserved segments of the population, and minimum temperature were among the factors with the strongest contributions. The findings of this study can provide useful insight to health authorities on prioritizing resource allocation to risk-prone areas.

TI Fully automatic knee osteoarthritis severity grading using deep neural
   networks with a novel ordinal loss
SO COMPUTERIZED MEDICAL IMAGING AND GRAPHICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Knee osteoarthritis; Kellgren and Lawrence grading; Ordinal loss;
   Convolutional neural network
AB Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is one major cause of activity limitation and physical disability in older adults. Early detection and intervention can help slow down the OA degeneration. Physicians' grading based on visual inspection is subjective, varied across interpreters, and highly relied on their experience. In this paper, we successively apply two deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) to automatically measure the knee OA severity, as assessed by the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading system. Firstly, considering the size of knee joints distributed in X-ray images with small variability, we detect knee joints using a customized one-stage YOLOv2 network. Secondly, we fine-tune the most popular CNN models, including variants of ResNet, VGG, and DenseNet as well as InceptionV3, to classify the detected knee joint images with a novel adjustable ordinal loss. To be specific, motivated by the ordinal nature of the knee KL grading task, we assign higher penalty to misclassification with larger distance between the predicted KL grade and the real KL grade. The baseline X-ray images from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) dataset are used for evaluation. On the knee joint detection, we achieve mean Jaccard index of 0.858 and recall of 92.2% under the Jaccard index threshold of 0.75. On the knee KL grading task, the fine-tuned VGG-19 model with the proposed ordinal loss obtains the best classification accuracy of 69.7% and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.344. Both knee joint detection and knee KL grading achieve state-of-the-art performance. The code, dataset, and models are released at https://github.com/PingjunChen/KneeAnalysis.

   cortex
SO NEUROIMAGE

DT Article
DE Aging; Dedifferentiation; Resting-state; Sensorimotor; Task activity
ID FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; MOTOR CORTEX
AB Normal aging is associated with declines in sensorimotor function. Previous studies have linked age-related behavioral declines to decreases in neural differentiation (i.e., dedifferentiation), including decreases in the distinctiveness of neural activation patterns and in the segregation of large-scale neural networks at rest. However, no studies to date have explored the relationship between these two neural measures and whether they explain the same aspects of behavior. To investigate these issues, we collected a battery of sensorimotor behavioral measures in older and younger adults and estimated (a) the distinctiveness of neural representations in sensorimotor cortex and (b) sensorimotor network segregation in the same participants. Consistent with prior findings, sensorimotor representations were less distinct and sensorimotor resting state networks were less segregated in older compared to younger adults. We also found that participants with the most distinct sensorimotor representations exhibited the most segregated sensorimotor networks. However, only sensorimotor network segregation was associated with individual differences in sensorimotor performance, particularly in older adults. These novel findings link network segregation to neural distinctiveness, but also suggest that network segregation may play a larger role in maintaining sensorimotor performance with age.

AB Background: Resistance to antiretroviral drugs is a complex and evolving area with relevant implications in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Several rules, algorithms and full-fledged computer programs have been developed to assist the HIV specialist in the choice of the best patient-tailored therapy.
   Methods: Experts' rules and statistical/machine learning algorithms for interpreting HIV drug resistance, along with their program implementations, were retrieved from PubMed and other on-line resources to be critically reviewed in terms of technical approach, performance, usability, update, and evolution (i.e. inclusion of novel drugs or expansion to other viral agents).
   Results: Several drug resistance prediction algorithms for the nucleotide/nucleoside/non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase, protease and integrase inhibitors as well as coreceptor antagonists are currently available, routinely used, and have been validated thoroughly in independent studies. Computer tools that combine single-drug genotypic/phenotypic resistance interpretation and optimize combination antiretroviral therapy have been also developed and implemented as web applications. Most of the systems have been updated timely to incorporate new drugs and few have recently been expanded to meet a similar need in the Hepatitis C area. Prototype systems aiming at predicting virological response from both virus and patient indicators have been recently developed but they are not yet being routinely used.
   Conclusion: Computing HIV genotype to predict drug susceptibility in vitro or response to combination antiretroviral therapy in vivo is a continuous and productive research field, translating into successful treatment decision support tools, an essential component of the management of HIV patients.

AB The purpose of this work is to study the feasibility of photon beam profile deconvolution using a feedforward neural network (NN) in very small fields (down to 0.56 x 0.56 cm(2)). The method's independence of the delivery and scanning system is also investigated. Lateral beam profiles of photon fields between 0.56 x 0.56 cm(2) and 4.03 x 4.03 cm(2) were collected on a Siemens Artiste linear accelerator. Three scanning ionization chambers (SNC 125c, PTW 31021, and PTW 31022) of sensitive volumes ranging from 0.016 cm(3) to 0.108 cm(3) were used with a PTW MP3 water phantom. A reference dataset was also collected with a PTW 60019 microDiamond detector to train and test individual NNs for each ionization chamber. Further testing of the trained NNs was performed with additional test data collected on an Elekta Synergy linear accelerator using a Sun Nuclear 3D Scanner. The results were evaluated with a 1D gamma analysis (0.5 mm/0.5%). After the deconvolution, the gamma passing rates increased from 54.79% to 99.58% for the SNC 125c, from 57.09% to 99.83% for the PTW 31021, and from 91.03% to 96.36% for the PTW 31022. The delivery system, the scanning system, the scanning mode (continuous vs. step-by-step), and the electrometer had no significant influence on the results. This study successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using NN to correct the beam profiles of very small photon fields collected with ionization chambers of various sizes. Its independence of the delivery and scanning system was also shown.

AB Background Effective management of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) following drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation is crucial for preventing adverse events. Traditional prognostic tools, such as rule-based methods or Cox regression, despite their widespread use and ease, tend to yield moderate predictive accuracy within predetermined timeframes. This study introduces a new contrastive learning-based approach to enhance prediction efficacy over multiple time intervals.Methods We utilized retrospective, real-world data from the OneFlorida + Clinical Research Consortium. Our study focused on two primary endpoints: ischemic and bleeding events, with prediction windows of 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months post-DES implantation. Our approach first utilized an auto-encoder to compress patient features into a more manageable, condensed representation. Following this, we integrated a Transformer architecture with multi-head attention mechanisms to focus on and amplify the most salient features, optimizing the representation for better predictive accuracy. Then, we applied contrastive learning to enable the model to further refine its predictive capabilities by maximizing intra-class similarities and distinguishing inter-class differences. Meanwhile, the model was holistically optimized using multiple loss functions, to ensure the predicted results closely align with the ground-truth values from various perspectives. We benchmarked model performance against three cutting-edge deep learning-based survival models, i.e., DeepSurv, DeepHit, and SurvTrace.Results The final cohort comprised 19,713 adult patients who underwent DES implantation with more than 1 month of records after coronary stenting. Our approach demonstrated superior predictive performance for both ischemic and bleeding events across prediction windows of 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months, with time-dependent concordance (Ctd) index values ranging from 0.88 to 0.80 and 0.82 to 0.77, respectively. It consistently outperformed the baseline models, including DeepSurv, DeepHit, and SurvTrace, with statistically significant improvement in the Ctd-index values for most evaluated scenarios.Conclusion The robust performance of our contrastive learning-based model underscores its potential to enhance DAPT management significantly. By delivering precise predictive insights at multiple time points, our method meets the current need for adaptive, personalized therapeutic strategies in cardiology, thereby offering substantial value in improving patient outcomes.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Unconstrained face recognition poses several challenges to existing algorithms and to address these variations, different methodologies are proposed, including utilizing video and 3D (depth) information. With the introduction of consumer level depth capturing devices such as Microsoft Kinect, research has been performed in utilizing low cost RGB-D depth data for characterizing and matching faces. Next generation of Kinect device, the Kinect version 2, has also been released which provides higher resolution color, depth and near infrared images at a comparable sensor cost. Such multiple information obtained from a single sensor can be extremely helpful in designing novel algorithms and systems for object and face recognition. This paper introduces the KaspAROV RGB-D video face database which contains face videos and images from both versions of the Kinect device for over 100 subjects which will be made available to the research community. The database captured in visible and NIR spectrum (along with depth) encompasses face images and videos with challenges such as pose, distance, and illumination. The database can be used to evaluate the performance of face recognition algorithms which utilize either uni-spectrum or multi-spectrum information. We provide standard experimental protocols for ease of comparative evaluation on the database and also include baseline results using several existing algorithms including a commercial face recognition system and deep learning algorithm.

DE Breathing; Cancer; Chemoreflex and hypoxia
ID INDEPENDENT DETERMINANT; INFLAMMATION; SURVIVAL
AB Background Cancer cachexia is an insidious process characterized by muscle atrophy with associated motor deficits, including diaphragm weakness and respiratory insufficiency. Although neuropathology contributes to muscle wasting and motor deficits in many clinical disorders, neural involvement in cachexia-linked respiratory insufficiency has not been explored. Methods We first used whole-body plethysmography to assess ventilatory responses to hypoxic and hypercapnic chemoreflex activation in mice inoculated with the C26 colon adenocarcinoma cell line. Mice were exposed to a sequence of inspired gas mixtures consisting of (i) air, (ii) hypoxia (11% O-2) with normocapnia, (iii) hypercapnia (7% CO2) with normoxia, and (iv) combined hypercapnia with hypoxia (i.e. maximal chemoreflex response). We also tested the respiratory neural network directly by recording inspiratory burst output from ligated phrenic nerves, thereby bypassing influences from changes in diaphragm muscle strength, respiratory mechanics, or compensation through recruitment of accessory motor pools. Results Cachectic mice demonstrated a significant attenuation of the hypoxic tidal volume (0.26mL +/- 0.01mL vs 0.30mL +/- 0.01mL; p<0.05), breathing frequency (317 +/- 10bpm vs 344 +/- 6bpm; p<0.05) and phrenic nerve (29.5 +/- 2.6% vs 78.8 +/- 11.8%; p<0.05) responses. On the other hand, the much larger hypercapnic tidal volume (0.46 +/- 0.01mL vs 0.46 +/- 0.01mL; p>0.05), breathing frequency (392 +/- 5bpm vs 408 +/- 5bpm; p>0.05) and phrenic nerve (93.1 +/- 8.8% vs 111.1 +/- 13.2%; p>0.05) responses were not affected. Further, the concurrent hypercapnia/hypoxia tidal volume (0.45 +/- 0.01mL vs 0.45 +/- 0.01mL; p>0.05), breathing frequency (395 +/- 7bpm vs 400 +/- 3bpm; p>0.05), and phrenic nerve (106.8 +/- 7.1% vs 147.5 +/- 38.8%; p>0.05) responses were not different between C26 cachectic and control mice. Conclusions Breathing deficits associated with cancer cachexia are specific to the hypoxic ventilatory response and, thus, reflect disruptions in the hypoxic chemoafferent neural network. Diagnostic techniques that detect decompensation and therapeutic approaches that support the failing hypoxic respiratory response may benefit patients at risk for cancer cachectic-associated respiratory failure.

AB Implementing accelerometer technologies in beef operations is an alternative to increase precision in estrous detection. We hypothesized that (1) the accelerometer algorithm has similar accuracy in detecting behavioral estrus as does visual observation of pressure-sensitive sensors (estrus patches) in grazing beef cows; (2) variables measured by the accelerometer, such as estrus intensity, are associated with hormonal, ovarian, and uterine variables monitored before, during, and after estrus; and (3) the accelerometer variables are associated with the probability of pregnancy in grazing beef cows submitted to embryo transfer (ET). Fifty cows were fitted with accelerometer and patches to detect estrus after a synchronization protocol in eight subsequent rounds. For each round, only cows that showed estrus (day 0; D0) received ET. Follicular diameter, endometrial thickness, corpus luteum (CL) area, and estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) concentrations were measured during proestrus, estrus, and early diestrus. On D7, ET was performed. Pregnancies were diagnosed on D46 and cows recovered for 35D before a new replicate. Patches had a greater accuracy (98 % vs. 91 %) of detection of behavioral estrus than accelerometer algorithm. Cows with lower estrus intensity in the accelerometer had greater follicular diameter on D0 (P = 0.022), CL area on D4 and D7 (P = 0.05), endometrial thickness on D-1 (P = 0.10), and reduced E2 concentrations on D-1 (P = 0.0032). The accelerometer variables did not predict accurately the probability of pregnancy/ET. In conclusion, visual observation of patches was more accurate in detecting estrus than the accelerometer algorithm and most of the associations between accelerometers and physiological variables were for characteristics measured at proestrus.

AB Introduction: Although the benefit in motor symptoms for well-selected patients with deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been established, cognitive declines associated with DBS can produce suboptimal clinical responses. Small decrements in cognition can lead to profound effects on quality of life. The growth of indications, the expansion of surgical targets, the increasing complexity of devices, and recent changes in stimulation paradigms have all collectively drawn attention to the need for re-evaluation of DBS related cognitive outcomes.
   Methods: To address the impact of cognitive changes following DBS, we performed a literature review using PubMed. We searched for articles focused on DBS and cognition. We extracted information about the disease, target, number of patients, assessment of time points, cognitive battery, and clinical outcomes. Diseases included were dystonia, Tourette syndrome (TS), essential tremor (ET), and Parkinson's disease (PD).
   Results: DBS was associated with mild cognitive issues even when rigorous patient selection was employed. Dystonia studies reported stable or improved cognitive scores, however one study using reliable change indices indicated decrements in sustained attention. Additionally, DBS outcomes were convoluted with changes in medication dose, alleviation of motor symptoms, and learning effects. In the largest, prospective TS study, an improvement in attentional skills was noted, whereas smaller studies reported variable declines across several cognitive domains. Although, most studies reported stable cognitive outcomes. ET studies largely demonstrated deficits in verbal fluency, which had variable responses depending on stimulation setting. Recently, studies have focused beyond the ventral intermediate nucleus, including the post-subthalamic area and zona incerta. For PD, the cognitive results were heterogeneous, although deficits in verbal fluency were consistent and related to the micro-lesion effect.
   Conclusion: Post-DBS cognitive issues can impact both motor and quality of life outcomes. The underlying pathophysiology of cognitive changes post-DBS and the identification of pathways underpinning declines will require further investigation. Future studies should employ careful methodological designs. Patient specific analyses will be helpful to differentiate the effects of medications, DBS and the underlying disease state, including disease progression. Disease progression is often an underappreciated factor that is important to post-DBS cognitive issues.

AB In this study, we conducted a citation network analysis of the Journal of Counseling Psychology (JCP) to elucidate the scope, evolution, and interconnections of JCP publications as reflected in how authors use (i.e., cite) these publications. We used CitNetExplorer to analyze a network of 4,718 JCP publications and 16,959 citation links. The analysis yielded 19 clusters in JCP's citation network. The most dominant facet of the citation network focused on counseling, counseling process, and counseling outcome. The clusters in this facet shifted from an early focus on perceptions of counselors to continuing examinations of what happens in counseling. Another dominant facet comprised clusters on vocational psychology, shifting from an earlier focus on vocational choice and interest, to career counseling and decision making, to vocational and academic development processes and predictors. These major facets converged toward a continuing cluster focused on methodology and analysis along with race, gender, sexuality, and other diversity scholarship. This suggests that diversity-focused publications in JCP often employ and cite methodological and analytic advances. The results also reveal discontinued areas of scholarship in JCP that are ripe for revisiting and rebuilding in new directions (e.g., anger and social justice activism; clinical judgment and artificial intelligence). The results suggest that a promising next step in the evolution of JCP would be for authors to engage with and cite diversity scholarship as central to "general" domains of JCP scholarship.

AB Cnidaria is the sister taxon to bilaterian animals, and therefore, represents a key reference lineage to understand early origins and evolution of the neural systems. The hydromedusa Aglantha digitale is arguably the best electrophysiologically studied jellyfish because of its system of giant axons and unique fast swimming/escape behaviors. Here, using a combination of scanning electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry together with phalloidin labeling, we systematically characterize both neural and muscular systems in Aglantha, summarizing and expanding further the previous knowledge on the microscopic neuroanatomy of this crucial reference species. We found that the majority, if not all (similar to 2,500) neurons, that are labeled by FMRFamide antibody are different from those revealed by anti-alpha-tubulin immunostaining, making these two neuronal markers complementary to each other and, therefore, expanding the diversity of neural elements in Aglantha with two distinct neural subsystems. Our data uncovered the complex organization of neural networks forming a functional "annulus-type" central nervous system with three subsets of giant axons, dozen subtypes of neurons, muscles, and a variety of receptors fully integrated with epithelial conductive pathways supporting swimming, escape and feeding behaviors. The observed unique adaptations within the Aglantha lineage (including giant axons innervating striated muscles) strongly support an extensive and wide-spread parallel evolution of integrative and effector systems across Metazoa.

AB Intelligent transport system is a greatly emerging technology in recent years. The stability and reliability of these systems is very important. In vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANET), the data transmission process can be improved by employing clustering process. The nodes can be clustered in order to utilize the maximum bandwidth of the network and improving network stability. In VANETs it is to introduce road safety and driver safety. In addition, security is a major concern and the malicious nodes need to be accurately detected. Several kinds of attacks can present in the VANETs. Hence an efficient authentication method and trust aware method is essentially required. In this work, stability assured CNN based trust aware clustering and authenticated transmission is introduced. For data authentication quantum cryptography technique is employed. In clustering process, trust degree of nodes is computed, vehicle speed is observed, direction of vehicle and distance among nodes are taken. In addition, for ensuring more safety, the critical data transmission is given higher priority. Therefore in clustering, data criticality parameter is also considered. For cluster formation, convolution neural network is employed. After the clustering process, the quantum cryptography based authentication is implemented for vehicle units and road side units. Data among these units are transmitted with quantum channel encryption key. Then simulation results are observed for validating the proposed protocol.

AB During the past 20 years, low-rank tensor and matrix decomposition models (LRDMs) have become indispensable tools for signal processing, machine learning, and data science. LRDMs represent high-dimensional, multiaspect, and multimodal data using low-dimensional latent factors in a succinct and parsimonious way. LRDMs can serve a variety of purposes, e.g., data embedding (dimensionality reduction), denoising, latent variable analysis, model parameter estimation, and big data compression; see [1]-[5] for surveys of applications.

AB The clock drawing test (CDT) is a neuropsychological assessment tool to screen an individual's cognitive ability. In this study, we developed a Fair and Interpretable Representation of Clock drawing test (FaIRClocks) to evaluate and mitigate classification bias against people with less than 8 years of education, while screening their cognitive function using an array of neuropsychological measures. In this study, we represented clock drawings by a priorly published 10-dimensional deep learning feature set trained on publicly available data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS). These embeddings were further fine-tuned with clocks from a preoperative cognitive screening program at the University of Florida to predict three cognitive scores: the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) total score, an attention composite z-score (ATT-C), and a memory composite z-score (MEM-C). ATT-C and MEM-C scores were developed by averaging z-scores based on normative references. The cognitive screening classifiers were initially tested to see their relative performance in patients with low years of education (< = 8 years) versus patients with higher education (> 8 years) and race. Results indicated that the initial unweighted classifiers confounded lower education with cognitive compromise resulting in a 100% type I error rate for this group. Thereby, the samples were re-weighted using multiple fairness metrics to achieve sensitivity/specificity and positive/negative predictive value (PPV/NPV) balance across groups. In summary, we report the FaIRClocks model, with promise to help identify and mitigate bias against people with less than 8 years of education during preoperative cognitive screening.

AB Tropical forests exhibit complex but poorly understood patterns of leaf phenology. Understanding species- and individual-level phenological patterns in tropical forests requires datasets covering large numbers of trees, which can be provided by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). In this paper, we test a workflow combining high-resolution RGB images (7 cm/pixel) acquired from UAVs with a machine learning algorithm to monitor tree and species leaf phenology in a tropical forest in Panama. We acquired images for 34 flight dates over a 12-month period. Crown boundaries were digitized in images and linked with forest inventory data to identify species. We evaluated predictions of leaf cover from different models that included up to 14 image features extracted for each crown on each date. The models were trained and tested with visual estimates of leaf cover from 2422 images from 85 crowns belonging to eight species spanning a range of phenological patterns. The best-performing model included both standard color metrics, as well as texture metrics that quantify within-crown variation, with r(2) of 0.84 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.8% in 10-fold cross-validation. In contrast, the model based only on the widely-used Green Chromatic Coordinate (GCC) index performed relatively poorly (r(2) = 0.52, MAE = 13.6%). These results highlight the utility of texture features for image analysis of tropical forest canopies, where illumination changes may diminish the utility of color indices, such as GCC. The algorithm successfully predicted both individual-tree and species patterns, with mean r(2) of 0.82 and 0.89 and mean MAE of 8.1% and 6.0% for individual- and species-level analyses, respectively. Our study is the first to develop and test methods for landscape-scale UAV monitoring of individual trees and species in diverse tropical forests. Our analyses revealed undescribed patterns of high intraspecific variation and complex leaf cover changes for some species.

AB Objective: The Cognitive Change Index (CCI-20) is a validated questionnaire that assesses subjective cognitive complaints (SCCs) across memory, language, and executive domains. We aimed to: (a) examine the internal consistency and construct validity of the CCI-20 in patients with movement disorders and (b) learn how the CCI-20 corresponds to objective neuropsychological and mood performance in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) or essential tremor (ET) seeking deep brain stimulation (DBS).Methods: 216 participants (N = 149 PD; N = 67 ET) underwent neuropsychological evaluation and received the CCI-20. The proposed domains of the CCI-20 were examined via confirmatory (CFA) and exploratory (EFA) factor analyses. Hierarchical regressions were used to assess the relationship among subjective cognitive complaints, neuropsychological performance and mood symptoms.Results: PD and ET groups were similar across neuropsychological, mood, and CCI-20 scores and were combined into one group who was well educated (m = 15.01 +/- 2.92), in their mid-60's (m = 67.72 +/- 9.33), predominantly male (63%), and non-Hispanic White (93.6%). Previously proposed 3-domain CCI-20 model failed to achieve adequate fit. Subsequent EFA revealed two CCI-20 factors: memory and non-memory (p < 0.001; CFI = 0.924). Regressions indicated apathy and depressive symptoms were associated with greater memory and total cognitive complaints, while poor executive function and anxiety were associated with more non-memory complaints.Conclusion: Two distinct dimensions were identified in the CCI-20: memory and non-memory complaints. Non-memory complaints were indicative of worse executive function, consistent with PD and ET cognitive profiles. Mood significantly contributed to all CCI-20 dimensions. Future studies should explore the utility of SCCs in predicting cognitive decline in these populations.

AB Bio-inspired Autonomous Underwater Vehicles with soft bodies provide significant performance benefits over conventional propeller-driven vehicles; however, it is difficult to control these vehicles due to their soft underactuated bodies. This study investigates the application of Physical Reservoir Computing (PRC) in the swimmer's flexible body to perform state estimation. This PRC informed state estimation has potential to be used in vehicle control. PRC is a type of recurrent neural network that leverages the nonlinear dynamics of a physical system to predict a nonlinear spatiotemporal input-output relationship. By embodying the neural network into the physical structure, PRC can process the response to an environment input with high computational efficiency. This study uses a soft bio-inspired propulsor embodied as a physical reservoir. We evaluate its ability to predict different state estimation tasks including hydrodynamic forces and benchmark computational tasks in response to the forcing applied to the artificial muscles during actuation. The propulsor's nonlinear fluid-structural dynamics act as the physical reservoir and the kinematic feedback serves as the reservoir readouts. We show that the bio-inspired underwater propulsor can predict the hydrodynamic thrust and benchmark tasks with high accuracy under specific input frequencies. By analyzing the frequency spectrum of the input, readouts, and target signals, we demonstrate that the system's dynamic response determines the frequency contents relevant to the task being predicted. The propulsor's ability to process information stems from its nonlinearity, as it is responsible to transform the input signal into a broader spectrum of frequency content at the readouts. This broad band of frequency content is necessary to recreate the target signal within the PRC algorithm, thereby improving the prediction performance. The spectral analysis provides a unique perspective to analyze the nonlinear dynamics of a physical reservoir and serves as a valuable tool for examining other types of vibratory systems for PRC. This work serves as a first step towards embodying computation into soft bio-inspired swimmers.

AB Objectives: Craniopharyngioma survivors experience cognitive deficits that negatively impact quality of life. Aerobic fitness is associated with cognitive benefits in typically developing children and physical exercise promotes recovery following brain injury. Accordingly, we investigated cognitive and neural correlates of aerobic fitness in a sample of craniopharyngioma patients. Methods: Patients treated for craniopharyngioma [N=104, 10.0 +/- 4.6 years, 48% male] participated in fitness, cognitive and fMRI (n=51) assessments following surgery but before proton radiation therapy. Results: Patients demonstrated impaired aerobic fitness [peak oxygen uptake (PKVO2)=23.9 +/- 7.1, 41% impaired (i.e., 1.5 SD<normative mean)], motor proficiency [Bruininks-Oseretsky (BOT2)=38.6 +/- 9.0, 28% impaired], and executive functions (e.g., WISC-IV Working Memory Index (WMI)=96.0 +/- 15.3, 11% impaired). PKVO2 correlated with better executive functions (e.g., WISC-IV WMI r=.27, p=.02) and academic performance (WJ-III Calculation r=.24, p=.04). BOT2 correlated with better attention (e.g., CPT-II omissions r=.26, p=.04) and executive functions (e.g., WISC-IV WMI r=.32, p=.01). Areas of robust neural activation during an n-back task included superior parietal lobule, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and middle and superior frontal gyri (p<.05, corrected). Higher network activation was associated with better working memory task performance and better BOT2 (p<.001). Conclusions: Before adjuvant therapy, children with craniopharyngioma demonstrate significantly reduced aerobic fitness, motor proficiency, and working memory. Better aerobic fitness and motor proficiency are associated with better attention and executive functions, as well as greater activation of a well-established working memory network. These findings may help explain differential risk/resiliency with respect to acute cognitive changes that may portend cognitive late effects. (JINS, 2019, 25, 413-425)

AB The translation of brief, millisecond-long pain-eliciting stimuli to the subjective perception of pain is associated with changes in theta, alpha, beta, and gamma oscillations over sensorimotor cortex. However, when a pain-eliciting stimulus continues for minutes, regions beyond the sensorimotor cortex, such as the prefrontal cortex, are also engaged. Abnormalities in prefrontal cortex have been associated with chronic pain states, but conventional, millisecond-long EEG paradigms do not engage prefrontal regions. In the current study, we collected high-density EEG data during an experimental paradigm in which subjects experienced a 4-s, low-or high-intensity pain-eliciting stimulus. EEG data were analyzed using independent component analyses, EEG source localization analyses, and measure projection analyses. We report three novel findings. First, an increase in pain perception was associated with an increase in gamma and theta power in a cortical region that included medial prefrontal cortex. Second, a decrease in lower beta power was associated with an increase in pain perception in a cortical region that included the contralateral sensorimotor cortex. Third, we used machine learning for automated classification of EEG data into low-and high-pain classes. Theta and gamma power in the medial prefrontal region and lower beta power in the contralateral sensorimotor region served as features for classification. We found a leave-one-out cross-validation accuracy of 89.58%. The development of biological markers for pain states continues to gain traction in the literature, and our findings provide new information that advances this body of work.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY The development of a biological marker for pain continues to gain traction in literature. Our findings show that high- and low-pain perception in human subjects can be classified with 89% accuracy using high- density EEG data from prefrontal cortex and contralateral sensorimotor cortex. Our approach represents a novel neurophysiological paradigm that advances the literature on biological markers for pain.

AB Integrated optimisation of production scheduling and distribution decision is necessary for reducing the whole cost of the supply chain in the make-to-order business environment. This paper studies a new integrated production scheduling and vehicle routing problem (IPSVRP) with inventory holding, delivery, and tardiness costs. The considered IPSVRP is modelled as a triple-objective optimisation problem, where the first objective aims to obtain the minimal total holding cost in the inventory, the second one attempts to achieve the minimal total travelling cost, and the third one tries to acquire the minimal total tardiness cost. To obtain a set of diverse non-dominated solutions in the Pareto-optimal front of the problem, we first derive several key structural properties used to provide necessary conditions for any solution to be Pareto-optimal through theoretical investigation. Based on the derived structural properties, a level-based multi-objective particle swarm optimizer (LMPSO) is subsequently designed. The performance of LMPSO is analysed by conducting a set of experiments, and its superiority is verified through comparing with other optimisation algorithms. Moreover, the convergence behaviour of LMPSO is also investigated, and the experimental results prove that it has the ability to achieve a set of non-dominated solutions proximity to the true Pareto front.

AB Currently the Protein Data Bank (PDB) contains over 25 000 structures that contain a metal ion including Na, Mg, K, Ca, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pd, Ag, Cd, Ir, Pt, Au, and Hg. In general, carrying out classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of metalloproteins is a convoluted and time-consuming process. Herein, we describe MCPB (Metal Center Parameter Builder), which allows one to conveniently and rapidly incorporate metal ions using the bonded plus electrostatics model (Hoops et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991, 113, 8262-8270) into the AMBER force field (FF). MCPB was used to develop a zinc FF, ZAFF, which is compatible with the existing AMBER FFs. The PDB was mined for all Zn-containing structures with most being tetrahedrally bound. The most abundant primary shell ligand combinations were extracted, and FFs were created. These include Zn bound to CCCC, CCCH, CCHH, CHHH, HHHH, HHHO, HHOO, HOOO, HHHD, and HHDD (O = water and the remaining are 1-letter amino acid codes). Bond and angle force constants and RESP charges were obtained from B3LYP/6-31G* calculations of model structures from the various primary shell combinations. MCPB and ZAFF can be used to create FFs for MD simulations of metalloproteins to study enzyme catalysis, drug design, and metalloprotein crystal refinement.

AB BackgroundThe research gap addressed in this study is the applicability of deep neural network (NN) models on wearable sensor data to recognize different activities performed by patients with Parkinson's Disease (PwPD) and the generalizability of these models to PwPD using labeled healthy data.MethodsThe experiments were carried out utilizing three datasets containing wearable motion sensor readings on common activities of daily living. The collected readings were from two accelerometer sensors. PAMAP2 and MHEALTH are publicly available datasets collected from 10 and 9 healthy, young subjects, respectively. A private dataset of a similar nature collected from 14 PwPD patients was utilized as well. Deep NN models were implemented with varying levels of complexity to investigate the impact of data augmentation, manual axis reorientation, model complexity, and domain adaptation on activity recognition performance.ResultsA moderately complex model trained on the augmented PAMAP2 dataset and adapted to the Parkinson domain using domain adaptation achieved the best activity recognition performance with an accuracy of 73.02%, which was significantly higher than the accuracy of 63% reported in previous studies. The model's F1 score of 49.79% significantly improved compared to the best cross-testing of 33.66% F1 score with only data augmentation and 2.88% F1 score without data augmentation or domain adaptation.ConclusionThese findings suggest that deep NN models originating on healthy data have the potential to recognize activities performed by PwPD accurately and that data augmentation and domain adaptation can improve the generalizability of models in the healthy-to-PwPD transfer scenario. The simple/moderately complex architectures tested in this study could generalize better to the PwPD domain when trained on a healthy dataset compared to the most complex architectures used. The findings of this study could contribute to the development of accurate wearable-based activity monitoring solutions for PwPD, improving clinical decision-making and patient outcomes based on patient activity levels.

AB Ridesharing is critical for promoting transportation sustainability. As a new form of ridesharing services, ridesplitting has rarely been studied. Based on the Chicago ridesourcing trip data, this study explores how ridesplitting adoption rate (i.e., the proportion of ridesourcing trips with ridesharing authorization) varies across space and what factors are associated with these variations. We find large variations in ridesplitting adoption rates across neighborhoods (Census Tracts) and across origin-destination (Census-Tract-to-Census-Tract) pairs. Particularly, the ridesplitting adoption rate is low for airport rides. We further apply a random forest model to explore which factors are key predictors of ridesplitting adoption rate across O-D pairs and to explore their nonlinear associations. The results suggest that the socioeconomic and demographic variables collectively contribute to 68.60% of the predictive power of the model, but travel-cost variables and built-environment-related factors are also important. The most important variables associated with ridesplitting adoption are ethnic composition, median household income, education level, trip distance, and neighborhood density. We further examine the nonlinear association between neighborhood ridesplitting adoption rate and several key variables such as the percentage of white population, median household income, and neighborhood Walk Score. The revealed nonlinear patterns can help transportation professionals identify neighborhoods with the greatest potential to promote ridesplitting.

AB Ctenophores are descendants of an early branching basal metazoan lineage, which may have evolved neurons and muscles independently from other animals. Mnemiopsis is one of the important reference ctenophore species. However, little is known about its neuromuscular organization. Here, we mapped and tracked the development of the neural and muscular elements in the early hatching cydippid larvae, as well as adult Mnemiopsis leidyi. The overall development of the neuromuscular system in Mnemiopsis was very similar to Pleurobrachia bachei, although in Mnemiopsis the entire process occurred significantly faster. The subepithelial neural cells were observed immediately after hatching. This population consisted of a dozen of separated individual neurons with short neurites. In about 2 days, when their neurites grew significantly longer and connected to their neighbors, they began to form a canonical polygonal subepithelial network. Mesogleal neural elements prominent in all studied adult ctenophores were not detectable in Mnemiopsis larvae but were clearly labeled in closely related Lobata species Bolinopsis infundibulum. Hatched larvae also had putative mechanoreceptors with long stereocilia and approximately two dozen muscle cells. In adult Mnemiopsis, the feeding lobes and auricles contained two distinct populations of neurons and neural ensembles that were not observed in other ctenophore lineages and likely represented elaborate neuronal innovations characteristic for the clade Lobata and their lifestyles.

AB The genetic etiologies of common diseases are highly complex and heterogeneous. Classic methods, such as linear regression, have successfully identified numerous variants associated with complex diseases. Nonetheless, for most diseases, the identified variants only account for a small proportion of heritability. Challenges remain to discover additional variants contributing to complex diseases. Expectile regression is a generalization of linear regression and provides complete information on the conditional distribution of a phenotype of interest. While expectile regression has many nice properties, it has rarely been used in genetic research. In this paper, we develop an expectile neural network (ENN) method for genetic data analyses of complex diseases. Similar to expectile regression, ENN provides a comprehensive view of relationships between genetic variants and disease phenotypes, which can be used to discover variants predisposing to sub-populations. We further integrate the idea of neural networks into ENN, making it capable of capturing non-linear and non-additive genetic effects (e.g., gene-gene interactions). Through simulations, we showed that the proposed method outperformed an existing expectile regression when there exist complex genotype-phenotype relationships. We also applied the proposed method to the data from the Study of Addiction: Genetics and Environment (SAGE), investigating the relationships of candidate genes with smoking quantity.

AB The use of neuro-physiological data in models of consumer choice is gaining popularity. This article presents some of the benefits of using psycho-physiological data in analyzing consumer valuation and choice. Eye-tracking, facial expressions, and electroencephalography (EEG) data were used to construct three non-conventional choice models, namely, eye-tracking, emotion and brain model. The predictive performance of the non-conventional models was compared to a baseline model, which was based entirely on conventional data. While the emotion and brain models proved to be as good as conventional data in explaining and predicting consumer choice, the eye-tracking model generated superior predictions. Moreover, we document a significant increase in predictive power when biometric data from different sources were combined into a mixed model. Finally, we utilize a machine learning technique to sparse the data and enhance out-of-sample prediction, thus showcasing the compatibility of biometric data with well-established statistical and econometric methods.

AB IARC has begun using ToxCast/Tox21 data in efforts to represent key characteristics of carcinogens to organize and weigh mechanistic evidence in cancer hazard determinations and this implicit inference approach also is being considered by USEPA. To determine how well ToxCast/Tox21 data can explicitly predict cancer hazard, this approach was evaluated with statistical analyses and machine learning prediction algorithms. Substances USEPA previously classified as having cancer hazard potential were designated as positives and substances not posing a carcinogenic hazard were designated as negatives. Then ToxCast/Tox21 data were analyzed both with and without adjusting for the cytotoxicity burst effect commonly observed in such assays. Using the same assignments as IARC of ToxCast/Tox21 assays to the seven key characteristics of carcinogens, the ability to predict cancer hazard for each key characteristic, alone or in combination, was found to be no better than chance. Hence, we have little scientific confidence in IARC's inference models derived from current ToxCast/Tox21 assays for key characteristics to predict cancer. This finding supports the need for a more rigorous mode-of-action pathway-based framework to organize, evaluate, and integrate mechanistic evidence with animal toxicity, epidemiological investigations, and knowledge of exposure and dosimetry to evaluate potential carcinogenic hazards and risks to humans.

AB Electricity access is a common issue around the world. Many countries that face this problem are located in the tropical region and solar energy might be an alternative to mitigate this limitation. Accurate mechanisms for forecasting solar irradiance and insolation provide important information regarding the potential for generating solar energy. Furthermore, this data is relevant for the planning of renewable energy projects, and energy policy formulation. This research introduces a pipeline for the one-day ahead forecasting of solar irradiance and insolation that only requires solar irradiance historical data for training. Our approach includes a data imputation stage to handle missing data. In the prediction stage, we consider four data-driven approaches: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, Single Layer Feed Forward Network, Multiple Layer Feed Forward Network, and Long Short-Term Memory. The experiments are performed in a real-world dataset collected by 12 Automatic Weather Stations located in Narino - Colombia. Our results show that the neural network-based models outperform Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average in most cases, and that Long Short-Term Memory exhibits better performance in cloudy environments (where more randomness is expected).

AB Chukar partridges (Alectoris chukar) are popular game birds that have been introduced throughout the world. Propagules of varying magnitudes have been used to try and establish populations into novel locations, though the relationship between propagule size and species establishment remains speculative. Previous qualitative studies argue that site-level factors are of importance when determining where to release Chukar. We utilized machine learning ensembles to evaluate bioclimatic and topographic data from native and naturalized regions to produce predictive species distribution models (SDMs) and evaluate the relationship between establishment and site-level factors for the conterminous United States. Predictions were then compared to a distribution map based on recorded occurrences to determine model prediction performance. SDM predictions scored an average of 88% accuracy and suitability favored states where Chukars were successfully introduced and are present. Our study shows that the use of quantitative models in evaluating environmental variables and that site-level factors are strong indicators of habitat suitability and species establishment.

AB One of the most important policy reforms for the European Union (EU) agriculture was the implementation of the Agenda 2000, which establishes a new framework for subsidies management, decoupled from both crop and animal production for the vast majority of products. One of the main goals of this new policy framework is the improvement of its environmental impact. Additionally, there is a need for the implementation of new efficiency assessment and prognostication tools for the evaluation of EU farming, because the influence of market forces has been increased substantially. Having in mind the efficacy of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methodology, it is used to calculate and quantify the environmental efficiency of EU countries' primary sectors. In this paper, the DEA Window methodology is used to assess GHG emissions efficiency and identify efficiency change of EU countries' primary sectors, under the strong influence of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), quantifying by this way its positive or negative impact on a national basis, providing at the same time hints for counteractive actions. The main results provide the significant differences among EU countries, with the less developed ones to perform low environmental efficiency rates. Moreover, countries which their output depends to a large extend on arable crops achieve low efficiency rates too. Finally, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are being used as a tool to estimate future performance of EU countries primary sectors on the topic of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions as an undesirable output of agricultural production process. The validation performance characteristics, as well as the linear fit to this output-target relationship, closely intersect the bottom-left and top-right corners of the plot. The combination of these methodologies provides a new methodological approach for CAP evaluation and prognostication, appropriately adjusted to the new market oriented framework for EU agricultural production.

AB In the presence of inorganic salts, secondary organic aerosol (SOA) undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), liquid-solid phase separation, or a homogeneous phase in ambient air. In this study, a regression model was derived to predict aerosol phase separation relative humidity (SRH) for various organic and inorganic mixes. The model implemented organic physicochemical parameters (i.e., oxygen to carbon ratio, molecular weight, and hydrogen-bonding ability) and the parameters related to inorganic compositions (i.e., ammonium, sulfate, nitrate, and water). The aerosol phase data were observed using an optical microscope and also collected from the literature. The crystallization of aerosols at the effloresce RH (ERH) was semiempirically predicted with a neural network model. Overall, the greater SRH appeared for the organic compounds with the lower oxygen to carbon ratios or the greater molecular weight and the higher aerosol acidity or the larger fraction of inorganic nitrate led to the lower SRH. The resulting model has been demonstrated for three different chamber-generated SOA (originated from beta-pinene, toluene, and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene), which were internally mixed with the inorganic aqueous system of ammonium-sulfate-water. For all three SOA systems, both observations and model predictions showed LLPS at RH <80%. In the urban atmosphere, LLPS is likely a frequent occurrence for the typical anthropogenic SOA, which originates from aromatic and alkane hydrocarbon.

AB Cameras are widely adopted for high image quality with the rapid advancement of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) image sensors while offloading vision applications' computation to the cloud. It raises concern for time-critical applications such as autonomous driving, surveillance, and defense systems since moving pixels from the sensor's focal plane are expensive. This paper presents a hardware architecture for smart cameras that understands the salient regions from an image frame and then performs high-level inference computation for sensor-level information creation instead of transporting raw pixels. A visual attention-oriented computational strategy helps to filter a significant amount of redundant spatiotemporal data collected at the focal plane. A computationally expensive learning model is then applied to the interesting regions of the image. The hierarchical processing in the pixels' data path demonstrates a bottom-up architecture with massive parallelism and gives high throughput by exploiting the large bandwidth available at the image source. We prototype the model in field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for integrating with a pixel-parallel image sensor. The experiment results show that our approach achieves significant speedup while in certain conditions exhibits up to 45% more energy efficiency with the attention-oriented processing. Although there is an area overhead for inheriting attention-oriented processing, the achieved performance based on energy consumption, latency, and memory utilization overcomes that limitation.

AB A polydimethylsiloxane microtunnel device with two wells is aligned and attached on top of a multi-electrode array. Neurons are grown first in one well and allow the propagation of axons through the tunnels into a second well. After 10 days, cells are plated in the second well, with much lower likelihood of extending axons back to the first well, with the intent of creating unidirectional connectivity between populations of neurons in the two wells. Here we report electrophysiological evidence that supports the hypothesis that the dominant information flow is in the desired direction. This was done by measuring the propagation speed and direction of individual action potentials, with the result that 84% of the spikes propagated in the desired direction. Further, we recorded globally synchronized burst activity on each of the electrodes, identified the timing of the first spike on each electrode, recorded locally synchronized burst activity which is found only in the second well and does not propagate back to the first well and concluded that this measure of burst propagation supports the hypothesis of a unidirectionally connected network. Two hypotheses are discussed for the mechanism underlying the activity pattern of the particular neural networks.

AB Ctenophora is an early-branching basal metazoan lineage, which may have evolved neurons and muscles independently from other animals. However, despite the profound diversity among ctenophores, basal neuroanatomical data are limited to representatives of two genera. Here, we describe the organization of neuromuscular systems in eight ctenophore species focusing on Euplokamis dunlapae-the representative of the lineage sister to all other ctenophores. Cydippids (Hormiphora hormiphora and Dryodora glandiformis) and lobates (Bolinopsis infundibulum and Mnemiopsis leidyi) were used as reference platforms to cover both morphological and ecological diversity within the phylum. We show that even with substantial environmental differences, the basal organization of neural systems is conserved among ctenophores. In all species, we detected two distributed neuronal subsystems: the subepithelial polygonal network and the mesogleal elements. Nevertheless, each species developed specific innovations in neural, muscular, and receptor systems. Most notable Euplokamis-specific features are the following: (a) Comb nerves with giant axons. These nerves directly coordinate the rapid escape response bypassing the central integrative structure known as the aboral sensory organ. (b) Neural processes in tentacles along the rows of "boxes" providing structural support and located under striated muscles. (c) Radial muscles that cross the mesoglea and connect the outer wall to the aboral canal. (d) Flat muscles, encircling each meridional canal. Also, we detected a structurally different rectangular neural network in the feeding lobes of Lobata (Mnemiopsis/Bolinopsis) but not in other species. The described lineage-specific innovations can be used for future single-cell atlases of ctenophores and analyses of neuronal evolution in basal metazoans.

AB Background: Deep brain stimulation surgery (DBS) for movement disorders has become commonplace and patients are beginning to present to specialized centers for second opinions. We aimed to uncover reasons for referral by analyzing a large single center cohort of DBS patients referred for management.
   Methods: Data were collected prospectively on a cohort of one hundred and eight patients who presented to the UF Movement Disorders Center for management following implantation at outside DBS centers. Data collected included referral reasons, pre-operative evaluation, DBS programming thresholds, DBS placement, need for optimization of therapy, and ultimate patient outcomes.
   Results: Ninety percent of patients reported at least one area of symptomatic dissatisfaction with the results of their DBS. Common issues included pre-operative misdiagnosis (28%), presence or exacerbation of symptoms not addressable by current DBS technology (48%), lead misplacement (43%), and need for medication (27%) or DBS programming (37%) optimization. Compared with leads placed using microelectrode recording (MER), leads placed without MER were strongly associated with misplacement (p = 0.03). Overall, 42% of subjects had no improvement, 37% slight improvement and 21% large improvement after medical and/or surgical management.
   Conclusions: This study reveals common reasons why DBS patients may seek follow-up care at another institution. Although 90% of patients reported one or more problematic areas, many of these could not be addressed by current DBS technology. Similar to prior studies, we found that lead misplacement was prominent, as was the need for optimization of medicines and/or stimulation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB BackgroundArtificial intelligence/computer-aided diagnosis (AI/CADx) and its use of radiomics have shown potential in diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer. Performance metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) are frequently used as figures of merit for the evaluation of CADx. Methods for evaluating lesion-based measures of performance may enhance the assessment of AI/CADx pipelines, particularly in the situation of comparing performances by classifier. PurposeThe purpose of this study was to investigate the use case of two standard classifiers to (1) compare overall classification performance of the classifiers in the task of distinguishing between benign and malignant breast lesions using radiomic features extracted from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (DCE-MR) images, (2) define a new repeatability metric (termed sureness), and (3) use sureness to examine if one classifier provides an advantage in AI diagnostic performance by lesion when using radiomic features. MethodsImages of 1052 breast lesions (201 benign, 851 cancers) had been retrospectively collected under HIPAA/IRB compliance. The lesions had been segmented automatically using a fuzzy c-means method and thirty-two radiomic features had been extracted. Classification was investigated for the task of malignant lesions (81% of the dataset) versus benign lesions (19%). Two classifiers (linear discriminant analysis, LDA and support vector machines, SVM) were trained and tested within 0.632 bootstrap analyses (2000 iterations). Whole-set classification performance was evaluated at two levels: (1) the 0.632+ bias-corrected area under the ROC curve (AUC) and (2) performance metric curves which give variability in operating sensitivity and specificity at a target operating point (95% target sensitivity). Sureness was defined as 1-95% confidence interval of the classifier output for each lesion for each classifier. Lesion-based repeatability was evaluated at two levels: (1) repeatability profiles, which represent the distribution of sureness across the decision threshold and (2) sureness of each lesion. The latter was used to identify lesions with better sureness with one classifier over another while maintaining lesion-based performance across the bootstrap iterations. ResultsIn classification performance assessment, the median and 95% CI of difference in AUC between the two classifiers did not show evidence of difference (& UDelta;AUC = -0.003 [-0.031, 0.018]). Both classifiers achieved the target sensitivity. Sureness was more consistent across the classifier output range for the SVM classifier than the LDA classifier. The SVM resulted in a net gain of 33 benign lesions and 307 cancers with higher sureness and maintained lesion-based performance. However, with the LDA there was a notable percentage of benign lesions (42%) with better sureness but lower lesion-based performance. ConclusionsWhen there is no evidence for difference in performance between classifiers using AUC or other performance summary measures, a lesion-based sureness metric may provide additional insight into AI pipeline design. These findings present and emphasize the utility of lesion-based repeatability via sureness in AI/CADx as a complementary enhancement to other evaluation measures.

Considering the lack of simulation tools to effectively and efficiently forecast wave forces on coastal box-girder bridges during tropical cyclones, this study investigates the impacts of solitary waves on box girders and accordingly develops a fast prediction model for solitary wave forces. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are used to simulate the hydrodynamic forces on the bridge deck. A total of 368 cases are calculated for the parametric study by varying the submergence coefficients (C-s), relative wave heights (H/h) and deck aspect ratios (W/h). With the CFD simulation results as the training datasets, an artificial neural network (ANN) is trained utilizing the back-propagation algorithm. The maximum wave forces first increase and then decrease with the C-s, while they monotonically increase with H/h. For relatively large H/h and small C-s values, the relationship between the maximum wave forces and W/h presents strong nonlinearities. The observed correlation coefficients between the ANN predictions and the CFD results for the vertical and horizontal wave forces are 98.6% and 98.1%, respectively. The trained ANN-based model shows good prediction accuracy and could be used as an efficient model for the tropical cyclone risk analysis of coastal bridges.

TI Overtriage, Undertriage, and Value of Care after Major Surgery: An
   Automated, Explainable Deep Learning-Enabled Classification System
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
LA English
DT Article
AB BACKGROUND: In single-institution studies, overtriaging low-risk postoperative patients to ICUs has been associated with a low value of care; undertriaging high-risk postoperative patients to general wards has been associated with increased mortality and morbidity. This study tested the reproducibility of an automated postoperative triage classification system to generating an actionable, explainable decision support system.STUDY DESIGN: This longitudinal cohort study included adults undergoing inpatient surgery at two university hospitals. Triage classifications were generated by an explainable deep learning model using preoperative and intraoperative electronic health record features. Nearest neighbor algorithms identified risk-matched controls. Primary outcomes were mortality, morbidity, and value of care (inverted risk-adjusted mortality/total direct costs).RESULTS: Among 4,669 ICU admissions, 237 (5.1%) were overtriaged. Compared with 1,021 control ward admissions, overtriaged admissions had similar outcomes but higher costs ($15.9K [interquartile range $9.8K to $22.3K] vs $10.7K [$7.0K to $17.6K], p < 0.001) and lower value of care (0.2 [0.1 to 0.3] vs 1.5 [0.9 to 2.2], p < 0.001). Among 8,594 ward admissions, 1,029 (12.0%) were undertriaged. Compared with 2,498 control ICU admissions, undertriaged admissions had longer hospital length-of-stays (6.4 [3.4 to 12.4] vs 5.4 [2.6 to 10.4] days, p < 0.001); greater incidence of hospital mortality (1.7% vs 0.7%, p = 0.03), cardiac arrest (1.4% vs 0.5%, p = 0.04), and persistent acute kidney injury without renal recovery (5.2% vs 2.8%, p = 0.002); similar costs ($21.8K [$13.3K to $34.9K] vs $21.9K [$13.1K to $36.3K]); and lower value of care (0.8 [0.5 to 1.3] vs 1.2 [0.7 to 2.0], p < 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: Overtriage was associated with low value of care; undertriage was associated with both low value of care and increased mortality and morbidity. The proposed framework for generating automated postoperative triage classifications is reproducible. (J Am Coll Surg 2023;236:279-291. (c) 2022 by the American College of Surgeons.

AB Immunosuppression after liver transplantation is essential for preventing allograft rejection. However, long-term drug toxicity and associated complications necessitate investigation of immunosuppression minimization and withdrawal protocols. Development of such protocols is hindered by reliance on current paradigms for monitoring allograft function and rejection status. The current standard of care for diagnosis of rejection is histopathologic assessment and grading of liver biopsies in accordance with the Banff Rejection Activity Index. However, this method is limited by cost, sampling variability, and interobserver variation. Moreover, the invasive nature of biopsy increases the risk of patient complications. Incorporating noninvasive techniques may supplement existing methods through improved understanding of rejection causes, hepatic spatial architecture, and the role of idiopathic fibroinflammatory regions. These techniques may also aid in quantification and help integrate emerging -omics analyses with current assessments. Alternatively, emerging noninvasive methods show potential to detect and distinguish between different types of rejection while minimizing risk of adverse advents. Although biomarkers have yet to replace biopsy, preliminary studies suggest that several classes of analytes may be used to detect rejection with greater sensitivity and in earlier stages than traditional methods, possibly when coupled with artificial intelligence. Here, we provide an overview of the latest efforts in optimizing the diagnosis of rejection in liver transplantation.

AB We have developed a MATLAB/C toolbox, Brain-SMART (System for Multivariate AutoRegressive Time series, or BSMART), for spectral analysis of continuous neural time series data recorded simultaneously from multiple sensors. Available functions include time series data importing/exporting, preprocessing (normalization and trend removal), AutoRegressive (AR) modeling (multivariate/bivariate model estimation and validation), spectral quantity estimation (auto power, coherence and Granger causality spectra), network analysis (including coherence and causality networks) and visualization (including data, power, coherence and causality views). The tools for investigating causal network structures in respect of frequency bands are unique functions provided by this toolbox. All functionality has been integrated into a simple and user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) environment designed for easy accessibility. Although we have tested the toolbox only on Windows and Linux operating systems, BSMART itself is system independent.

AB Actual evapotranspiration (ETa) plays a crucial role in the water and energy cycles of the earth. An accurate estimate of the ETa is essential for management of the water resources, agriculture, and irrigation, as well as research on atmospheric variations. Despite the importance of accurate ETa values, estimating and mapping them remains challenging due to the physical and biological complexity of the ET process. As a novel approach for rapid and reliable estimation of ETa, the present study develops automated deep learning (AutoDL) models that incorporate a metaheuristic optimization algorithm for image processing, architectural design, and hyper-parameter tuning. The proposed AutoDL models integrate three different spatial and channel attention mecha-nisms, including a novel activated spatial attention mechanism (ASPAM), with the U-Net architecture. Bypassing the need for meteorological inputs, the proposed framework uses Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) products and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data as inputs. To evaluate the performance of the models, they are applied to three study areas in the United States with various climatic characteristics. According to the results, during the spring and summer, when the target values have higher certainty, the estimations are highly promising, with R2 as high as 0.91 and MAPE as low as 6.40%. Furthermore, the proposed ASPAM module improves the accuracy of ETa estimations compared to attention gate (AG) and squeeze and excitation (SE) attention modules. The results also indicate that the MODIS raw products and derived vegetation and water indices can predict ETa within a reliable range of accuracy, with the addition of DEM data marginally enhancing the models' performance. The automatic workflow of this model makes it significantly easy to use, contributing to its applicability and generalizability for enhancing atmospheric research.

AB A significant proportion of autism risk genes regulate synapse function, including plasticity, which is believed to contribute to behavioral abnormalities. However, it remains unclear how impaired synapse plasticity contributes to network-level processes linked to adaptive behaviors, such as experience-dependent ensemble plasticity. We found that Syngap1, a major autism risk gene, promoted measures of experience-dependent excitatory synapse strengthening in the mouse cortex, including spike-timing-dependent glutamatergic synaptic potentiation and presynaptic bouton formation. Synaptic depression and bouton elimination were normal in Syngap1 mice. Within cortical networks, Syngap1 promoted experience-dependent increases in somatic neural activity in weakly active neurons. In contrast, plastic changes to highly active neurons from the same ensemble that paradoxically weaken with experience were unaffected. Thus, experience-dependent excitatory synapse strengthening mediated by Syngap1 shapes neuron-specific plasticity within cortical ensembles. We propose that other genes regulate neuron-specific weakening within ensembles, and together, these processes function to redistribute activity within cortical networks during experience.

AB Despite the availability of many drugs and therapies to treat malaria, many countries' national policies recommend using a single first-line therapy for most clinical malaria cases. To assess whether this is the best strategy for the population as a whole, we designed an evolutionary-epidemiological modeling framework for malaria and compared the benefits of different treatment strategies in the context of resistance evolution. Our results show that the population-wide use of multiple first-line therapies (MFT) against malaria yields a better clinical outcome than using a single therapy or a cycling strategy where therapies are rotated, either on a fixed cycling schedule or when resistance levels or treatment failure become too high. MFT strategies also delay the emergence and slow the fixation of resistant strains (phenotypes), and they allow a larger fraction of the population to be treated without trading off future treatment of cases that may be untreatable because of high resistance levels. Earlier papers have noted that cycling strategies have the disadvantage of creating a less temporally variable environment than MFT strategies, making resistance evolution easier for the parasite. Here, we illustrate a second feature of parasite ecology that impairs the performance of cycling policies, namely, that cycling policies degrade the mean fitness of the parasite population more quickly than MFT policies, making it easier for new resistant types to invade and spread. The clinical benefits of using multiple first-line therapies against malaria suggest that MFT policies should play a key role in malaria elimination and control programs.

AB We use monthly data covering a century-long sample period (1915-2021) to study whether geopolitical risk helps to forecast subsequent gold volatility. We account not only for geopolitical threats and acts, but also for 39 country-specific sources of geopolitical risk. The response of subsequent volatility is heterogeneous across countries and nonlinear. We find that accounting for geopolitical risk at the country level improves forecast accuracy, especially when we use random forests to estimate our forecasting models. As an extension, we report empirical evidence on the predictive value of the country-level sources of geopolitical risk for two other candidate safe-haven assets, oil and silver, over the sample periods 1900-2021 and 1915-2021, respectively. Our results have important implications for the portfolio and risk-management decisions of investors who seek a safe haven in times of heightened geopolitical tensions.

AB While museum voucher specimens continue to be the standard for species identifications, biodiversity data are increasingly represented by photographic records from camera traps and amateur naturalists. Some species are easily recognized in these pictures, others are impossible to distinguish. Here we quantify the extent to which 335 terrestrial nonvolant North American mammals can be identified in typical photographs, with and without considering species range maps. We evaluated all pairwise comparisons of species and judged, based on professional opinion, whether they are visually distinguishable in typical pictures from camera traps or the iNaturalist crowdsourced platform on a 4-point scale: (1) always, (2) usually, (3) rarely, or (4) never. Most (96.5%) of the 55,944 pairwise comparisons were ranked as always or usually distinguishable in a photograph, leaving exactly 2,000 pairs of species that can rarely or never be distinguished from typical pictures, primarily within clades such as shrews and small-bodied rodents. Accounting for a species geographic range eliminates many problematic comparisons, such that the average number of difficult or impossible-to-distinguish species pairs from any location was 7.3 when considering all species, or 0.37 when considering only those typically surveyed with camera traps. The greatest diversity of difficult-to-distinguish species was in Arizona and New Mexico, with 57 difficult pairs of species, suggesting the problem scales with overall species diversity. Our results show which species are most readily differentiated by photographic data and which taxa should be identified only to higher taxonomic levels (e.g., genus). Our results are relevant to ecologists, as well as those using artificial intelligence to identify species in photographs, but also serve as a reminder that continued study of mammals through museum vouchers is critical since it is the only way to accurately identify many smaller species, provides a wealth of data unattainable from photographs, and constrains photographic records via accurate range maps. Ongoing specimen voucher collection, in addition to photographs, will become even more important as species ranges change, and photographic evidence alone will not be sufficient to document these dynamics for many species.

AB Background and Objectives: Prediction of decline to dementia using objective biomarkers in high-risk patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) has immense utility. Our objective was to use multimodal MRI to (1) determine whether accurate and precise prediction of dementia conversion could be achieved using baseline data alone, and (2) generate a map of the brain regions implicated in longitudinal decline to dementia.Methods: Participants meeting criteria for aMCI at baseline (N = 55) were classified at follow-up as remaining stable/improved in their diagnosis (N = 41) or declined to dementia (N = 14). Baseline T1 structural MRI and resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) were combined and a semi-supervised support vector machine (SVM) which separated stable participants from those who decline at follow-up with maximal margin. Cross-validated model performance metrics and MRI feature weights were calculated to include the strength of each brain voxel in its ability to distinguish the two groups.Results: Total model accuracy for predicting diagnostic change at follow-up was 92.7% using baseline T1 imaging alone, 83.5% using rsfMRI alone, and 94.5% when combining T1 and rsfMRI modalities. Feature weights that survived the p < 0.01 threshold for separation of the two groups revealed the strongest margin in the combined structural and functional regions underlying the medial temporal lobes in the limbic system.Discussion: An MRI-driven SVM model demonstrates accurate and precise prediction of later dementia conversion in aMCI patients. The multi-modal regions driving this prediction were the strongest in the medial temporal regions of the limbic system, consistent with literature on the progression of Alzheimer's disease.

AB Binary stars undergo a variety of interactions and evolutionary phases, critical for predicting and explaining observations. Binary population synthesis with full simulation of stellar structure and evolution is computationally expensive, requiring a large number of mass-transfer sequences. The recently developed binary population synthesis code POSYDON incorporates grids of MESA binary star simulations that are interpolated to model large-scale populations of massive binaries. The traditional method of computing a high-density rectilinear grid of simulations is not scalable for higher-dimension grids, accounting for a range of metallicities, rotation, and eccentricity. We present a new active learning algorithm, psy-cris, which uses machine learning in the data-gathering process to adaptively and iteratively target simulations to run, resulting in a custom, high-performance training set. We test psy-cris on a toy problem and find the resulting training sets require fewer simulations for accurate classification and regression than either regular or randomly sampled grids. We further apply psy-cris to the target problem of building a dynamic grid of MESA simulations, and we demonstrate that, even without fine tuning, a simulation set of only similar to 1/4 the size of a rectilinear grid is sufficient to achieve the same classification accuracy. We anticipate further gains when algorithmic parameters are optimized for the targeted application. We find that optimizing for classification only may lead to performance losses in regression, and vice versa. Lowering the computational cost of producing grids will enable new population synthesis codes such as POSYDON to cover more input parameters while preserving interpolation accuracies.

AB The use of placebo to reduce pain is well documented; however, knowledge of the neural mechanisms underlying placebo analgesia remains incomplete. This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 30 healthy individuals and dynamic causal modeling to investigate changes in effective connectivity associated with the placebo analgesic response. Before scanning, participants were conditioned to expect less thermal pain at 2 of 4 sites on their feet. Visual analog scale pain ratings revealed a significant but small difference between the baseline and placebo sites (mean difference = 6.63, t(29) = 3.91, P <= .001, d = .97), confirming an analgesic effect. However, no significant differences in the magnitude of brain activation between conditions were observed via traditional random effects general linear modeling. Dynamic causal modeling was then used to investigate changes in effective connectivity during placebo analgesia. The results indicate that during placebo analgesia but not baseline condition, couplings between brain regions, including those involved in cognitive processes (eg, attention, expectation, evaluation), were significantly enhanced. Specifically, a significantly consistent decrease in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex periaqueductal gray coupling was found. These findings highlight the differences between pain processing and modulation at the network level. Moreover, our results suggest that,small placebo effects may be better characterized via changes in the temporal dynamics among pain modulatory regions than only via changes in the magnitude of blood oxygenation level dependent activation. Further application of nuanced analytical approaches that are sensitive to temporal dynamics of pain-related processes such as dynamic causal modeling are necessary to better understand the neural mechanisms underlying pain processing in patient populations.
   Perspective: Changes in effective connectivity among pain-related brain regions may be more sensitive detectors of the neural representation of small placebo effects than are changes in the magnitude of brain activation. Knowledge of these mechanisms highlights the importance of integrated neural networks in the understanding of pain modulation. (C) 2015 by the American Pain Society

AB Objective Adults with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) require less energy intake to maintain body weight than the general adult population. This, combined with their altered gastrointestinal transit time, may impact microbiota composition. The aim of the study was to determine if the fecal microbiota composition of adults with PWS differed from non-affected adults. Using usual diet/non-interventional samples, fecal microbiota composition was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and data from adults with PWS were merged with four other adult cohorts that differed by geographical location and age. QIIME 2 (TM) sample-classifier, machine learning algorithms were used to cross-train the samples and predict from which dataset the taxonomic profiles belong. Taxa that most distinguished between all datasets were extracted and a visual inspection of the R library PiratePlots was performed to select the taxa that differed in abundance specific to PWS. Results Fecal microbiota composition of adults with PWS showed low Blautia and enhanced RF39 (phyla Tenericutes), Ruminococcaceae, Alistipes, Erysipelotrichacaea, Parabacteriodes and Odoribacter. Higher abundance of Tenericutes, in particular, may be a signature characteristic of the PWS microbiota although its relationship, if any, to metabolic health is not yet known.

AB There has been a significant amount of research on the neural mechanisms underlying "basic emotions" but relatively less research on complex social emotions like pride, embarrassment, guilt, or shame. The aim of this study was to investigate age-related differences in the neural basis of processing anger, joy, pride, and embarrassment, and possible association with well-being measurements, such as depression, anxiety and stress. Twenty-four younger and twenty-five older adults underwent functional imaging while viewing videos of four emotions and indicating the emotion expressed. Using multivariate analysis (Partial Least Squares), we found that older adults engaged a similar network for both anger and pride, while younger adults recruited two separate networks for positive vs. negative emotions, regardless of whether the emotion was basic or social. Furthermore, older adults with higher stress scores and younger adults with higher depression scores, as measured by the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS-21), activated a similar brain network during recognition of embarrassment. These findings suggest that both pride and anger are emotionally salient and require similar cognitive and attentional resources in older adults, while younger adults' neural activity is modulated by the valence, rather than the social content of stimuli. Our results also highlight the importance of considering age when studying the neural basis of complex, self-conscious, emotions and their association with well-being measurements.

ID LATENT DIRICHLET ALLOCATION; MODEL
AB The Latent Dirichlet Location (LDA) model is a popular method for creating mixed-membership clusters. Despite having been originally developed for text analysis, LDA has been used for a wide range of other applications. We propose a new formulation for the LDA model which incorporates covariates. In this model, a negative binomial regression is embedded within LDA, enabling straight-forward interpretation of the regression coefficients and the analysis of the quantity of cluster-specific elements in each sampling units (instead of the analysis being focused on modeling the proportion of each cluster, as in Structural Topic Models). We use slice sampling within a Gibbs sampling algorithm to estimate model parameters. We rely on simulations to show how our algorithm is able to successfully retrieve the true parameter values and the ability to make predictions for the abundance matrix using the information given by the covariates. The model is illustrated using real data sets from three different areas: text-mining of Coronavirus articles, analysis of grocery shopping baskets, and ecology of tree species on Barro Colorado Island (Panama). This model allows the identification of mixed-membership clusters in discrete data and provides inference on the relationship between covariates and the abundance of these clusters.

AB We present a cryogenic infrared spectroscopy study of protonated 3,4-methylenedioxymethampetamine (MDMA) and some of its metabolites. The IR spectra are sufficiently well resolved to give distinct vibrational signatures for each molecule, as well as indicate common functional groups in some of the variants. A more detailed analysis reveals that the spectral interpretation is more complex. The overly rich IR spectra already betray the existence of a number of conformers, which are assigned by comparison to quantum-chemical calculations. An attempt to quantify the various conformers for MDMA was not successful, strongly suggesting that the conformers can freely interconvert at these cryogenic temperatures. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Identification and segregation of citrus fruit with diseases and peel blemishes are required to preserve market value. Previously developed machine vision approaches could only distinguish cankerous from non-cankerous citrus, while this research focused on detecting eight different peel conditions on citrus fruit using hyperspectral (HSI) imagery and an AI-based classification algorithm. The objectives of this paper were: (i) selecting the five most discriminating bands among 92 using PCA, (ii) training and testing a custom convolution neural network (CNN) model for classification with the selected bands, and (iii) comparing the CNN's performance using 5 PCA bands compared to five randomly selected bands. A hyperspectral imaging system from earlier work was used to acquire reflectance images in the spectral region from 450 to 930 nm (92 spectral bands). Ruby Red grapefruits with normal, cankerous, and 5 other common peel diseases including greasy spot, insect damage, melanose, scab, and wind scar were tested. A novel CNN based on the VGG-16 architecture was developed for feature extraction, and SoftMax for classification. The PCA-based bands were found to be 666.15, 697.54, 702.77, 849.24 and 917.25 nm, which resulted in an average accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 99.84%, 99.84% and 99.98% respectively. However, 10 trials of five randomly selected bands resulted in only a slightly lower performance, with accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 98.87%, 98.43% and 99.88%, respectively. These results demonstrate that an AI-based algorithm can successfully classify eight different peel conditions. The findings reported herein can be used as a precursor to develop a machine vision-based, real-time peel condition classification system for citrus processing.

AB This study addresses two critical research gaps in human-robot interaction (HRI): the limited systematic research on the role of trust in customers' acceptance of artificially intelligent (AI) robots; and the lack of understanding of robot acceptance under different cultural backgrounds. Drawing on the AIDUA framework, this study examines the impacts of trust and moderating effects of both national (the U.S. and China) and individual culture on customers' intentions to use AI robots in hospitality services by developing a theoretical model. The model is tested on data collected using online data collection platforms from 491 U.S. and 495 Chinese respondents. PLS-SEM and the bootstrapping method were used to test the hypothesized relationships and analyze the moderating effects of culture, respectively. The findings suggest that trust in interaction with AI robots is a significant higher -order construct that influences the intention of use. Furthermore, uncertainty avoidance, long-term orientation, and power distance have been found to exhibit significant moderation effects. The results of this study extend the theoretical frameworks in HRI and provide detailed guidance to promote AI robot applications across different cultures.

AB Rivers and streams are control points for CO2 emission to the air (fCO(2)), with emission rates often exceeding internal metabolism (net ecosystem production, NEP). The difference is usually attributed to CO2-supersaturated groundwater inputs from upland soil respiration and rock weathering, but this implies a terrestrial-to-aquatic C transfer greater than estimated by terrestrial mass balance. One explanation is that riparian zones-rich in organic and inorganic C but mostly neglected in terrestrial mass balances-contribute disproportionately to fCO(2). To test this hypothesis, we measured fCO(2), NEP, and the lateral CO2 contributions from both terrestrial uplands (TER) and riparian wetlands (RIP) for seven reaches in a lowland river network in Florida, USA. NEP contributed about half of fCO(2), but the remaining CO2 emission was generally much larger than measured TER. The relative importance of RIP versus TER varied markedly between contrasting hydrogeologic settings: RIP contributed 49% of fCO(2) where geologic confinement forced lateral drainage through riparian soils, but only 12% where unconfined karst allowed deeper groundwater flowpaths that bypassed riparian zones. On a land area basis, the narrow riparian corridor yielded far more CO2 than the terrestrial uplands (33.1 vs. 1.4 g-C m(-2) yr(-1)), resulting in river corridors (i.e., stream channel plus adjacent wetlands, NEP + RIP) sourcing 87% of fCO(2) to streams. Our findings imply that true terrestrial CO2 subsidies to streams may be smaller than previously estimated by aquatic mass balance and highlight the importance of explicitly integrating riparian zones into the conceptual model for terrestrial-to-aquatic C transfer.
   Plain Language Summary Globally, rivers and streams emit a similar amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere as the land retains. To help curb CO2 emissions that cause climate change, we need to understand what is generating these high rates of stream CO2 emissions. While biological processes in the stream can generate CO2, the bulk of stream CO2 is thought to come from upland soils, carried by run-off from the land to the streams where it off-gases. In this study of seven streams of varying sizes in the same river network, we measured CO2 fluxes from both the stream and land to better understand where the CO2 emissions come from. We observed that a large fraction-sometimes all-of the CO2 delivered to the stream channel from groundwater comes from the wetlands next to the stream. Indeed, about half of CO2 emissions came from stream organisms consuming organic carbon, and one-third from the thin band of riparian wetlands bordering the stream. Thus, we conclude that the narrow river corridor (the stream plus adjacent wetlands) is the source of 87% of the CO2 emitted by streams, and that the uplands that comprise most of the land area are a much smaller source than expected.

AB The fast transmission rate of COVID-19 worldwide has made this virus the most important challenge of year 2020. Many mitigation policies have been imposed by the governments at different regional levels (country, state, county, and city) to stop the spread of this virus. Quantifying the effect of such mitigation strategies on the transmission and recovery rates, and predicting the rate of new daily cases are two crucial tasks. In this paper, we propose a hybrid modeling framework which not only accounts for such policies but also utilizes the spatial and temporal information to characterize the pattern of COVID-19 progression. Specifically, a piecewise susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model is developed while the dates at which the transmission/recover rates change significantly are defined as "break points" in this model. A novel and data-driven algorithm is designed to locate the break points using ideas from fused lasso and thresholding. In order to enhance the forecasting power and to describe additional temporal dependence among the daily number of cases, this model is further coupled with spatial smoothing covariates and vector auto-regressive (VAR) model. The proposed model is applied to several U.S. states and counties, and the results confirm the effect of "stay-at-home orders" and some states' early "re-openings" by detecting break points close to such events. Further, the model provided satisfactory short-term forecasts of the number of new daily cases at regional levels by utilizing the estimated spatio-temporal covariance structures. They were also better or on par with other proposed models in the literature, including flexible deep learning ones. Finally, selected theoretical results and empirical performance of the proposed methodology on synthetic data are reported which justify the good performance of the proposed method.

SO PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE
LA English
DT Article
AB Introduction Prior studies examining prehospital characteristics related to return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) are limited to structured data. Natural language processing (NLP) could identify new factors from unstructured data using free-text narratives. The purpose of this study was to use NLP to examine EMS clinician free-text narratives for characteristics associated with prehospital ROSC in pediatric OHCA. Methods This was a retrospective analysis of patients ages 0-17 with OHCA in 2019 from the ESO Data Collaborative. We performed an exploratory analysis of EMS narratives using NLP with an a priori token library. We then constructed biostatistical and machine learning models and compared their performance in predicting ROSC. Results There were 1,726 included EMS encounters for pediatric OHCA; 60% were male patients, and the median age was 1 year (IQR 0-9). Most cardiac arrest events (61.3%) were unwitnessed, 87.3% were identified as having medical causes, and 5.9% had initial shockable rhythms. Prehospital ROSC was achieved in 23.1%. Words most positively correlated with ROSC were "ROSC" (r = 0.42), "pulse" (r = 0.29), "drowning" (r = 0.13), and "PEA" (r = 0.12). Words negatively correlated with ROSC included "asystole" (r = -0.25), "lividity" (r = -0.14), and "cold" (r = -0.14). The terms "asystole," "pulse," "no breathing," "PEA," and "dry" had the greatest difference in frequency of appearance between encounters with and without ROSC (p < 0.05). The best-performing model for predicting prehospital ROSC was logistic regression with random oversampling using free-text data only (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.92). Conclusions EMS clinician free-text narratives reveal additional characteristics associated with prehospital ROSC in pediatric OHCA. Incorporating those terms into machine learning models of prehospital ROSC improves predictive ability. Therefore, NLP holds promise as a tool for use in predictive models with the goal to increase evidence-based management of pediatric OHCA.

AB Accurately quantifying forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is one of the most significant challenges in remote sensing, and is critical for understanding global carbon sequestration. Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) for monitoring AGB stocks and change (Delta AGB) in a selectively logged tropical forest in eastern Amazonia. Specifically, we compare results from a suite of different modelling methods with extensive field data. The calibration AGB values were derived from 85 square field plots sized 50 x 50 m field plots established in 2014 and which were estimated using airborne LiDAR data acquired in 2012, 2014, and 2017. LiDAR-derived metrics were selected based upon Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and used to estimate AGB stock and change. The statistical approaches were: ordinary least squares regression (OLS), and nine machine learning approaches: random forest (RF), several variations of k-nearest neighbour (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural networks (ANN). Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) was used to compare performance based upon root mean square error (RMSE) and mean difference (MD). The results show that OLS had the best performance with an RMSE of 46.94 Mg/ha (19.7%) and R-2 = 0.70. RF, SVM, and ANN were adequate, and all approaches showed RMSE <= 54.48 Mg/ha (22.89%). Models derived from k-NN variations all showed RMSE >= 64.61 Mg/ha (27.09%). The OLS model was thus selected to map AGB across the time-series. The mean (+/- sd-standard deviation) predicted AGB stock at the landscape level was 229.10 (+/- 232.13) Mg/ha in 2012, 258.18 (+/- 106.53) in 2014, and 240.34 (sd +/- 177.00) Mg/ha in 2017, showing the effect of forest growth in the first period and logging in the second period. In most cases, unlogged areas showed higher AGB stocks than logged areas. Our methods showed an increase in AGB in unlogged areas and detected small changes from reduced-impact logging (RIL) activities occurring after 2012. We also detected that the AGB increase in areas logged before 2012 was higher than in unlogged areas. Based on our findings, we expect our study could serve as a basis for programs such as REDD+ and assist in detecting and understanding AGB changes caused by selective logging activities in tropical forests.

AB The burgeoning field of brain health research increasingly leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze and interpret neuroimaging data. Medical foundation models have shown promise of superior performance with better sample efficiency. This work introduces a novel approach towards creating 3-dimensional (3D) medical foundation models for multimodal neuroimage segmentation through self-supervised training. Our approach involves a novel two-stage pretraining approach using vision transformers. The first stage encodes anatomical structures in generally healthy brains from the large-scale unlabeled neuroimage dataset of multimodal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images from 41,400 participants. This stage of pertaining focuses on identifying key features such as shapes and sizes of different brain structures. The second pretraining stage identifies disease-specific attributes, such as geometric shapes of tumors and lesions and spatial placements within the brain. This dual-phase methodology significantly reduces the extensive data requirements usually necessary for AI model training in neuroimage segmentation with the flexibility to adapt to various imaging modalities. We rigorously evaluate our model, BrainSegFounder, using the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge and Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke v2.0 (ATLAS v2.0) datasets. BrainSegFounder demonstrates a significant performance gain, surpassing the achievements of the previous winning solutions using fully supervised learning. Our findings underscore the impact of scaling up both the model complexity and the volume of unlabeled training data derived from generally healthy brains. Both of these factors enhance the accuracy and predictive capabilities of the model in neuroimage segmentation tasks. Our pretrained models and code are at https://github.com/lab-smile/BrainSegFounder.

AB In this work we are going to present how an interactive platform can be used as a powerful tool to allow students to better explore a foundational problem in quantum chemistry: the application of the variational method to the dihydrogen molecule using simple Gaussian trial functions. The theoretical approach for the hydrogen atom is quite straightforward, however, the level of complexity increases considerably for the dihydrogen molecule. Although, as shown in this work, it is possible to obtain an analytical expression for the dihydrogen molecule variational integral by "pen-and-paper", this expression cannot be completely appreciated without the proper tools. In this work the "dry" analytical equations were implemented into an interactive platform that allows the students to visualize results (like probability densities and meaningful graphs), play with parameters, and thus gain a deeper understanding of the problem itself. Having an interactive environment is also important as a way of minimizing complex equations, testing analytical results with numerical calculations, among other things,that otherwise would be unachievable by "pen and paper" only. Additionally, in this work the bonding and antibonding behaviors of the dihydrogen molecule were investigated and evaluated in detail. As a final outcome, this article shows that important properties regarding, the dihydrogen molecule (like equilibrium bond length an favorability of formation) can be explained and approximated with the variational method.

AB Exposures to air pollutants have been associated with various acute respiratory diseases and detrimental human health. Analysis and further interpretation of air pollutant patterns are correspondingly important as monitoring them. In the present study, the 24-h and four-month indoor and outdoor PM2.5, PM10, NO2, relative humidity, and temperature were measured simultaneously for a laboratory in Gainesville city, Florida. The indoor PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 concentrations were predicted using multiple linear regression (MLR), time series regression (TSR), and artificial neural networks (ANN) models. The modeling conducted in this study aims to perform a cross comparison study between these models in a symmetric environment. The value of root-mean-square error was improved by 18.33% in comparison with the MLR model. In addition, the value of the coefficient of determination was improved by 24.68%. The ANN model had the best performance and could predict the target air pollutants at 10-min intervals of the studied building with 90% accuracy levels. The TSR model showed slightly better performance compared to the MLR model. These results can be accordingly referred for studies analyzing indoor air quality in similar building types and climate zones.

AB Objectives To evaluate and compare the performance of ChatGPT (TM) (Open AI (R)) and Bing AI (TM) (Microsoft (R)) for responding to kidney stone treatment-related questions in accordance with the American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines and assess factors such as appropriateness, emphasis on consulting healthcare providers, references, and adherence to guidelines by each chatbot. Methods We developed 20 kidney stone evaluation and treatment-related questions based on the AUA Surgical Management of Stones guideline. Questions were asked to ChatGPT and Bing AI chatbots. We compared their responses utilizing the brief DISCERN tool as well as response appropriateness. Results ChatGPT significantly outperformed Bing AI for questions 1-3, which evaluate clarity, achievement, and relevance of responses (12.77 +/- 1.71 vs. 10.17 +/- 3.27; p < 0.01). In contrast, Bing AI always incorporated references, whereas ChatGPT never did. Consequently, the results for questions 4-6, which evaluated the quality of sources, were consistently favored Bing AI over ChatGPT (10.8 vs. 4.28; p < 0.01). Notably, neither chatbot offered guidance against guidelines for pre-operative testing. However, recommendations against guidelines were notable for specific scenarios: 30.5% for the treatment of adults with ureteral stones, 52.5% for adults with renal stones, and 20.5% for all patient treatment. Conclusions ChatGPT significantly outperformed Bing AI in terms of providing responses with clear aim, achieving such aim, and relevant and appropriate responses based on AUA surgical stone management guidelines. However, Bing AI provides references, allowing information quality assessment. Additional studies are needed to further evaluate these chatbots and their potential use by clinicians and patients for urologic healthcare-related questions.

AB The architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) education communities are increasingly facing challenges caused by social, technological, economic, environmental, and political changes. Addressing these issues requires AEC educators and practitioners to systematically rethink and reform many of their current practices. Anecdotal evidence in AEC education already exists with respect to pedagogical improvements made by individual technologies such as immersive computing, artificial intelligence, robotics, big data, cyberinfrastructure, and photogrammetry. However, an effective learning-centered environment is more complex than what any single technology can accomplish. In addition, the relationship between technology-intensive learning and digital inequity in AEC education remains, to the most extent, unclear. We envision the next-generation learning-centered environment for AEC education to be technology-intensive, interdisciplinary, industry-linked, and equitable. This paper aims to present a shared vision of the next-generation learning-centered environment for AEC education. To achieve this goal, two interrelated workshops were organized with the participation of different stakeholders, including researchers, educators, and professionals from multiple disciplines of architecture, engineering, construction, computer science, learning science, education, and social sciences. This paper is based on the combined outcomes of the two workshops, organized in four themes: (1) AEC curricula and industry practice, (2) technology and learning, (3) interdisciplinary education, and (4) digital inequity. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge by creating a pathway to timely reflect on new learning strategies, new technologies, and future industry and societal needs in AEC curricula, thus producing a more adaptive AEC workforce for the 21st century. The findings of this work can be adopted by educators to develop a roadmap for creating the shared vision of the next-generation learning-centered environment for AEC education.

AB We report the design and application of a Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMs) device that permits investigators to create arbitrary network topologies. With this device investigators can manipulate the degree of functional connectivity among distinct neural populations by systematically altering their geometric connectivity in vitro. Each polydimethylsilxane (PIDMS) device was cast from molds and consisted of two wells each containing a small neural population of dissociated rat cortical neurons. Wells were separated by a series of parallel micrometer scale tunnels that permitted passage of axonal processes but not somata; with the device placed over an 8 x 8 microelectrode array, action potentials from somata in wells and axons in microtunnels can be recorded and stimulated. In our earlier report we showed that a one week delay in plating of neurons from one well to the other led to a filling and blocking of the microtunnels by axons from the older well resulting in strong directionality (older to younger) of both axon action potentials in tunnels and longer duration and more slowly propagating bursts of action potentials between wells. Here we show that changing the number of tunnels, and hence the number of axons, connecting the two wells leads to changes in connectivity and propagation of bursting activity. More specifically, the greater the number of tunnels the stronger the connectivity, the greater the probability of bursting propagating between wells, and shorter peak-to-peak delays between bursts and time to first spike measured in the opposing well. We estimate that a minimum of 100 axons are needed to reliably initiate a burst in the opposing well. This device provides a tool for researchers interested in understanding network dynamics who will profit from having the ability to design both the degree and directionality connectivity among multiple small neural populations.

AB The default mode network (DMN) is activated when constructing and imagining narrative events, with functional brain activity in the medial-prefrontal cortex hypothesized to be modulated during emotional processing by adding value (or pleasure) to the episodic representation. However, since enhanced reactivity during emotional, compared to neutral, content is a more frequent finding in both the brain and body in physiological, neural, and behavioral measures, the current study directly assesses the effects of pleasure and emotion during narrative imagery in the DMN by using a within-subject design to first identify the DMN during resting state and then assess activation during pleasant, neutral, or unpleasant imagery. Replicating previous findings, enhanced functional activity in the medial prefrontal cortex was found when imagining pleasant, compared to unpleasant, events. On the other hand, emotion-related activation was found when imagining either pleasant or unpleasant, compared to neutral, events in other nodes of the DMN including the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), angular gyrus, anterior hippocampus, lateral temporal cortex, temporal pole, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC). Pervasive emotional modulation in the DMN is consistent with the view that a primary function of event retrieval and construction is to remember, recreate, and imagine motivationally relevant events important for planning adaptive behavior.

AB The density of mitotic figures (MF) within tumor tissue is known to be highly correlated with tumor proliferation and thus is an important marker in tumor grading. Recognition of MF by pathologists is subject to a strong inter-rater bias, limiting its prognostic value. State-of-the-art deep learning methods can support experts but have been observed to strongly deteriorate when applied in a different clinical environment. The variability caused by using different whole slide scanners has been identified as one decisive component in the underlying domain shift. The goal of the MICCAI MIDOG 2021 challenge was the creation of scanner-agnostic MF detection algorithms. The challenge used a training set of 200 cases, split across four scanning systems. As test set, an additional 100 cases split across four scanning systems, including two previously unseen scanners, were provided. In this paper, we evaluate and compare the approaches that were submitted to the challenge and identify methodological factors contributing to better performance. The winning algorithm yielded an 1 score of 0.748 (CI95: 0.704-0.781), exceeding the performance of six experts on the same task.

TI Compensatory Neural Activity in Response to Cognitive Fatigue

AB Prolonged continuous performance of a cognitively demanding task induces cognitive fatigue and is associated with a time-related deterioration of objective performance, the degree of which is referred to cognitive fatigability. Although the neural underpinnings of cognitive fatigue are poorly understood, prior studies report changes in neural activity consistent with deterioration of task-related networks over time. While compensatory brain activity is reported to maintain motor task performance in the face of motor fatigue and cognitive performance in the face of other stressors (e.g., aging) and structural changes, there are no studies to date demonstrating compensatory activity for cognitive fatigue. High-density electroencephalography was recorded from human subjects during a 160 min continuous performance of a cognitive control task. While most time-varying neural activity showed a linear decline over time, we identified an evoked potential over the anterior frontal region which demonstrated an inverted U-shaped time-on-task profile. This evoked brain activity peaked between 60 and 100 min into the task and was positively associated with better behavioral performance only during this interval. Following the peak and during subsequent decline of this anterior frontal activity, the rate of performance decline also accelerated. These findings demonstrate that this anterior frontal brain activity, which is not part of the primary task-related activity at baseline, is recruited to compensate for fatigue-induced impairments in the primary task-related network, and that this compensation terminates as cognitive fatigue further progresses. These findings may be relevant to understanding individual differences in cognitive fatigability and developing interventions for clinical conditions afflicted by fatigue.

AB The redundancy allocation problem is an important problem in system reliability design. Many researchers have investigated the redundancy allocation problem under different assumptions and for various system configurations. However, most of the studies have disregarded the dependence among components and subsystems. In real-world applications, the performance of components and subsystems can affect each others. For instance, the heat radiated by a subsystem can accelerate degradation of adjacent components or subsystems. In this article, a procedure is proposed for solving the redundancy allocation problem of a bridge structure with dependent subsystems. Copula theory is utilized for modeling dependence among subsystems, and artificial neural network and particle swarm optimization are applied for finding the best redundancy allocation. A numerical example is included to elaborate the proposed procedure and show its applicability.

AB Background and AimsTo enhance Brazilian sugarcane production sustainably, crop simulation models have been utilized. However, due to the lack of reliable information, particularly concerning soil variability, these models have shown limited performance for specific analyses. This study aims to evaluate Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) as an alternative for filling soil data gaps in crop modeling and to assess the influence of these products on prediction uncertainties. The study site is located in Piracicaba region, Southern Brazil.MethodsThe framework was: (i) a legacy soil data were utilized, and equal-spline equations were applied to standardize the dataset.; (ii) a machine learning (ML) algorithm was used to predict soil attributes and their uncertainties; (iii) pedotransfer functions were applied to obtain soil hydrological properties; (iv) DSSAT/CANEGRO crop model was used to estimate sugarcane yield; (iv) a legacy soil map (LSM), SoilGrids (SG) and a map of attributes derived from regional DSM (RDSM) were compared; (v) a Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) was conducted with the RDSM maps to evaluate the impact of uncertainties in the estimation of sugarcane yield.ResultsThe DSM proved to be a reliable source for use in crop models, reaching similar results to field data. The sugarcane yield map emphasized the model's sensitivity to soil attributes, with texture and depth significantly impacting yield estimations.ConclusionIn this sense, coupling DSM and crop modeling is a feasible way to improve yield estimates, especially in countries with limited soil databases.

AB Several efforts are currently underway to decipher the connectome or parts thereof in a variety of organisms. Ascertaining the detailed physiological properties of all the neurons in these connectomes, however, is out of the scope of such projects. It is therefore unclear to what extent knowledge of the connectome alone will advance a mechanistic understanding of computation occurring in these neural circuits, especially when the high-level function of the said circuit is unknown. We consider, here, the question of how the wiring diagram of neurons imposes constraints on what neural circuits can compute, when we cannot assume detailed information on the physiological response properties of the neurons. We call such constraints-that arise by virtue of the connectome-connectomic constraints on computation. For feedforward networks equipped with neurons that obey a deterministic spiking neuron model which satisfies a small number of properties, we ask if just by knowing the architecture of a network, we can rule out computations that it could be doing, no matter what response properties each of its neurons may have. We show results of this form, for certain classes of network architectures. On the other hand, we also prove that with the limited set of properties assumed for our model neurons, there are fundamental limits to the constraints imposed by network structure. Thus, our theory suggests that while connectomic constraints might restrict the computational ability of certain classes of network architectures, we may require more elaborate information on the properties of neurons in the network, before we can discern such results for other classes of networks.

AB In this manuscript we propose a method for the autonomous determination of endmembers in hyperspectral imagery based on recent theoretical advancements on lattice auto-associative memories. Given a hyperspectral image, the lattice algebra approach finds in a single-pass all possible candidate endmembers from which various affinely independent sets of final endmembers may be derived. In contrast to other endmember detection methods. the endmembers found using two dual canonical lattice matrices are geometrically linked to the data set spectra. The mathematical foundation of the proposed method is first described in some detail followed by application examples that illustrate the key steps of the proposed lattice based method.

AB Many logic locking schemes have been proposed and subsequently broken in recent years most notably by oracle-guided SAT-solver-based attacks. This has in part been due to a lack of formal definitions of security. Recent work has however taken the first steps towards this by defining some notions of security. One such notion, exact-functional-secrecy (EFS) is satisfied as soon as the attacker is not able to learn the precise functionality of the original circuit. This is less stringent than the approximate-functional-secrecy (AFS) notion of security which captures approximation-resiliency. This paper focuses on EFS. We present first a novel SAT-based attack that can automatically divide the deobfuscation of a locked circuit into two different processes: a) deobfuscating high-activity/entropy nets which contribute to AFS and are best handled by a few queries and heavy SAT-solving, and b) deobfuscating low-activity nets which require many useless queries in search of a few rare informative queries. The attack, called the rare-fast-querying (RFQ) SAT attack, guarantees key-correctness for logic outside of low-activity cones, and is not exclusive to a specific low-activity locking scheme. We show how the RFQ attack can under some conditions, avoid exponential querying altogether. Given the insight from this attack, we then present a deeper look into EFS and discuss simple techniques to achieve always-exponential EFS with bearable overhead. We show how one can take advantage of the abundance of comparator logic at the RT-level of control-oriented designs to achieve EFS with even less overhead via absorbing existing structures.

AB Differential diagnosis among a group of histologically similar cancers poses a challenging problem in clinical medicine. Constructing a classifier based on gene expression signatures comprising multiple discriminatory molecular markers derived from microarray data analysis is an emerging trend for cancer diagnosis. To identify the best genes for classification using a small number of samples relative to the genome size remains the bottleneck of this approach, despite its promise. We have devised a new method of gene selection with reliability analysis, and demonstrated that this method can identify a more compact set of genes than other methods for constructing a classifier with optimum predictive performance for both small round blue cell tumors and leukemia. High consensus between our result and the results produced by methods based on artificial neural networks and statistical techniques confers additional evidence of the validity of our method. This study suggests a way for implementing a reliable molecular cancer classifier based on gene expression signatures.

AB The paper provides a review of empirical modeling and its application within construction engineering and management. The scope of application and trends in use of this approach are first assessed, and the potential for its further development is identified. This is followed by an examination of the key components of empirical modeling, namely: the structure and operation of the model and the scheme used in its development. The paper then provides a rigorous methodology that must be followed to ensure the validity and value of the end model, covering the steps: strategizing; data collation and assessment; model development; model evaluation and final selection; final validation; and implementation. The methodology is designed to cater for all forms of empirical modeling including the procedurally more demanding development algorithms that have become available in recent years, such as simulated evolution. Overall, the paper is designed to provide researchers embarking on an empirical modeling study with an overview of when it is appropriate to use this approach, what type of system to adopt, and how to ensure development of a successful end product.

AB The affective dimension of pain is made up of feelings of unpleasantness and emotions associated with future implications, termed secondary affect. Experimental and clinical studies show serial interactions between pain sensation intensity, pain unpleasantness, and secondary affect. These pain dimensions and their interactions relate to a central network of brain structures that processes nociceptive information both in a parallel and in series. Spinal pathways to limbic structures and medial thalamic nuclei provide direct inputs to brain areas involved in affect. Another source is from spinal pathways to somatosensory thalamic and cortical areas and then through a cortico-limbic pathway. The latter integrates nociceptive input with contextual information and memory to provide cognitive mediation of pain affect. Both direct and cortical-limbic pathways converge on the same anterior cingulate cortical and subcortical structures whose function may be to establish emotional valence and response priorities.

AB The broad goal of the research surveyed in this article is to develop methods for understanding the aggregate behavior of interconnected dynamical systems, as found in mathematical physics, neuroscience, economics, power systems and neural networks. Questions concern prediction of emergent (often unanticipated) phenomena, methods to formulate distributed control schemes to influence this behavior, and these topics prompt many other questions in the domain of learning. The area of mean field games, pioneered by Peter Caines, are well suited to addressing these topics. The approach is surveyed in the present paper within the context of controlled coupled oscillators.

TI SiGra: single-cell spatial elucidation through an image-augmented graph

ID MOUSE; EXPRESSION
AB Recent advances in high-throughput molecular imaging have pushed spatial transcriptomics technologies to subcellular resolution, which surpasses the limitations of both single-cell RNA-seq and array-based spatial profiling. The multichannel immunohistochemistry images in such data provide rich information on the cell types, functions, and morphologies of cellular compartments. In this work, we developed a method, single-cell spatial elucidation through image-augmented Graph transformer (SiGra), to leverage such imaging information for revealing spatial domains and enhancing substantially sparse and noisy transcriptomics data. SiGra applies hybrid graph transformers over a single-cell spatial graph. SiGra outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both single-cell and spot-level spatial transcriptomics data from complex tissues. The inclusion of immunohistochemistry images improves the model performance by 37% (95% CI: 27-50%). SiGra improves the characterization of intratumor heterogeneity and intercellular communication and recovers the known microscopic anatomy. Overall, SiGra effectively integrates different spatial modality data to gain deep insights into spatial cellular ecosystems.
   Recent advances have pushed spatial transcriptomics to subcellular resolution. Here, the authors propose SiGra, a graph artificial intelligence model designed for high-throughput spatial molecular imaging.

AB Recently, the minimum error entropy criterion, an information theoretic alternative to the traditional mean square error criterion, has been successfully used in the contexts of machine learning and signal processing. For system identification, however, the MEE criterion will be no longer suitable if the training data are discrete-valued, since minimizing error's discrete entropy cannot constrain error's dispersion. In this paper, to make the MEE criterion suitable for the discrete-valued data cases, we give a new entropy definition for the discrete random variables, i.e. the Delta-entropy, based on Riemann sums for finite size partitions. A probability weighted formula is established to calculate the average partition. This new entropy retains some important properties of the differential entropy and reduces to discrete entropy under certain conditions. Unlike discrete entropy, the Delta-entropy is sensitive to the dynamic range of the data, and can be used as a superior optimality criterion in system identification problems. Also, we present a plug-in estimate of Delta-entropy, analyze its asymptotic behavior and explore the links to the kernel based and m-spacing based estimates for differential entropy. Finally, the Delta-entropy criterion is applied in system identification with coarsely quantized input-output data to search for the optimum parameter set. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the performance improvement that may be achieved with the Delta-entropy criterion. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB To meet the demands of diverse and rapidly evolving markets, system-on-chips (SoCs) are becoming more complex in size and functionality. More intellectual properties (IPs) and hardware accelerators are required to support a varied set of applications with faster response. In recent years, there has been a growing trend of using reconfigurable and adaptable hardware for compute-intensive kernels, e.g., neural networks, crypto-engines, and blockchains. Hence, embedded FPGA (eFPGA) technology has emerged as a standard solution incorporated into the SoC to enhance computational performance and provide reconfigurability. However, with the increasing complexity and size of modern SoCs, coupled with the integration of third-party IPs (3PIPs) and accelerators, ensuring the information security, i.e., integrity, confidentiality, and availability, of critical and sensitive data has become more challenging than ever before. Thus, a sustainable and upgradable security auditing infrastructure has become a necessity. This article extends EnSAFe, a framework specially crafted to streamline security policy auditing while enabling upgradability within designs that leverage eFPGA-based accelerators. The EnSAFe framework enables signal monitoring in a plug-and-play fashion, and the monitoring core logic is mapped onto the eFPGA accelerator component with minimal overhead. We extend EnSAFe through novel methodologies and algorithms for security policy generation, optimization of security policy implementations, and enhancement of the reconfigurability of the security status monitor (SSM). We also establish a security policy database and assess the effectiveness of the extended framework for policy checking across various use case scenarios. Our experiments show that EnSAFe can detect runtime threats/vulnerabilities at low area overhead.

AB Natural images containing affective scenes are used extensively to investigate the neural mechanisms of visual emotion processing. Functional fMRI studies have shown that these images activate a large-scale distributed brain network that encompasses areas in visual, temporal, and frontal cortices. The underlying spatial and temporal dynamics, however, remain to be better characterized. We recorded simultaneous EEG-fMRI data while participants passively viewed affective images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). Applying multivariate pattern analysis to decode EEG data, and representational similarity analysis to fuse EEG data with simultaneously recorded fMRI data, we found that: (1) similar to 80 ms after picture onset, perceptual processing of complex visual scenes began in early visual cortex, proceeding to ventral visual cortex at similar to 100 ms, (2) between similar to 200 and similar to 300 ms (pleasant pictures: similar to 200 ms; unpleasant pictures: similar to 260 ms), affect-specific neural representations began to form, supported mainly by areas in occipital and temporal cortices, and (3) affect-specific neural representations were stable, lasting up to similar to 2 s, and exhibited temporally generalizable activity patterns. These results suggest that affective scene representations in the brain are formed temporally in a valence-dependent manner and may be sustained by recurrent neural interactions among distributed brain areas.

AB Deep neural networks have achieved tremendous success due to their representation power and adaptation to low-dimensional structures. Their potential for estimating structured regression functions has been recently established in the literature. However, most of the studies require the input dimension to be fixed, and consequently, they ignore the effect of dimension on the rate of convergence and hamper their applications to modern big data with high dimensionality. In this paper, we bridge this gap by analyzing a k-way nonparametric interaction model in both growing dimension scenarios (d grows with n but at a slower rate) and in high dimension (d greater than or similar to n). In the latter case, sparsity assumptions and associated regularization are required to obtain optimal convergence rates. A new challenge in diverging dimension setting is in calculation mean-square error; the covariance terms among estimated additive components are an order of magnitude larger than those of the variances and can deteriorate statistical properties without proper care. We introduce a critical debiasing technique to amend the problem. We show that under certain standard assumptions, debiased deep neural networks achieve a minimax optimal rate both in terms of (n, d). Our proof techniques rely crucially on a novel debiasing technique that makes the covariances of additive components negligible in the mean-square error calculation. In addition, we establish the matching lower bounds.

AB Background: Machine learning is a promising tool for biomarker-based diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Performing multimodal feature selection and studying the interaction between biological and clinical AD can help to improve the performance of the diagnosis models.
   Objective: This study aims to formulate a feature ranking metric based on the mutual information index to assess the relevance and redundancy of regional biomarkers and improve the AD classification accuracy.
   Methods: From the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), 722 participants with three modalities, including florbetapir-PET, flortaucipir-PET, and MRI, were studied. The multivariate mutual information metric was utilized to capture the redundancy and complementarity of the predictors and develop a feature ranking approach. This was followed by evaluating the capability of single-modal and multimodal biomarkers in predicting the cognitive stage.
   Results: Although amyloid-beta deposition is an earlier event in the disease trajectory, tau PET with feature selection yielded a higher early-stage classification F1-score (65.4%) compared to amyloid-beta PET (63.3%) and MRI (63.2%). The SVC multimodal scenario with feature selection improved the F1-score to 70.0% and 71.8% for the early and late-stage, respectively. When age and risk factors were included, the scores improved by 2 to 4%. The Amyloid-Tau-Neurodegeneration [AT(N)] framework helped to interpret the classification results for different biomarker categories.
   Conclusion: The results underscore the utility of a novel feature selection approach to reduce the dimensionality of multimodal datasets and enhance model performance. The AT(N) biomarker framework can help to explore the misclassified cases by revealing the relationship between neuropathological biomarkers and cognition.

AB Conservation programs need improved tools to measure the recovery of animal diversity across restoration gradients. We used soundscapes and expert identifications of bird species to calculate niche position (i.e., mean of environmental conditions across all areas a species occupies) and niche breadth (i.e., the standard deviation of the species distribution) along a recovery gradient; from agriculture to early (up to 20 yrs) and late (up to 38 yrs) recovery, to old-growth forests. Our survey included 323 bird species and was conducted in 66 plots in the lowland Chocoan tropical rainforest in Ecuador where less than 11% of the forest remains intact, and large areas are currently undergoing regeneration post-abandonment. First, we validated our niche metrics by contrasting them against independent global categories of forest density dependency. We then explained the niche metrics of the bird species with different ecological traits, gathered from the literature, reflecting species-specific primary diet, morphology and distribution, and accounting for the phylogenetic relatedness of species. Finally, we explored the phylogenetic signal present in bird species' ecological traits and recovery niche metrics. Niche position and breadth across the recovery gradient closely followed global categories of forest density dependency. However, our approach provided a more fine-scaled sorting of bird species in forest plots categorized as late recovery and old-growth. Granivorous birds occupied niche positions in active cacao and pasture plots and were replaced by frugivorous birds in older regeneration plots. Along the recovery gradient, tail length and handwing index decreased with niche position, supporting previous observations that birds in old-growth forests are less mobile. Birds in old-growth forests had smaller global distribution ranges than birds in agricultural plots. Finally, the latitudinal distribution of birds in the study area averaged south of the equator, with birds in oldgrowth plots averaging latitudinal centroids in wet forests north of the equator, whereas birds in agriculture plots averaged latitudinal centroids further south of the country, towards the dry and open Tumbesian forest. Frugivores, invertivores and vertivores had broader niche breadths, but these decreased (marginally) with tail length. We suggest these recovery niche metrics as a potentially powerful tool for the rapid assessment of the recovery process, which might support conservation strategies such as biodiversity credits, compensation payments, and strategic land purchases. With the increasing availability of information-intensive models for bird species identification, such as deep learning artificial intelligence, our new niche metrics open the avenue for rapid assessment of tropical biodiversity and new conservation areas at larger scales.

AB The present study evaluates the capability of a novel optimization method in modeling daily crop reference evapotranspiration (ETo), a critical issue in water resource management. A hybrid predictive model based on the artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm that is embedded within the COOT method (COOT bird natural life model-artificial neural network (COOT-ANN)) is developed and evaluated for its suitability for the prediction of daily ETo at seven meteorological stations in different states of Australia. Accordingly, a daily statistical period of 12 years (01-01-2010 to 31-12-2021) for climatic data of maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and ETo were collected. The results are evaluated using six performance criteria metrics: correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), RMSE-observation standard deviation ratio (RSR), Scatter Index (SI), and mean absolute error (MAE) along with the Taylor diagrams. The performance of the COOT-ANN model was compared with those of the conventional ANN model. The results showed that the COOT-ANN hybrid model outperforms the ANN model at all seven stations by 0.803%, 4.127%, 3.359%, 4.072%, 4.148%, and 3.665% based on the average values of the R, RMSE, NSE, RSR, SI, and MAE criteria, respectively. So, this study provides an innovative method for prediction in agricultural and water resource studies.

AB As the world's population grows, global food production will need to increase. While food production efficiency has increased in recent decades through pathogen control, climate change poses new challenges in crop protection against pathogens. Understanding the natural geographical distribution and dispersal likelihood of fungal plant pathogens is essential for forecasting disease plant spread. Here we used cultivation-independent techniques to identify fungal plant pathogens in 1,289 near-surface dust samples collected across the United States. We found that overall fungal pathogen community composition is more related to environmental conditions (in particular soil pH, precipitation and frost) than to agricultural hosts and practices. We also delimited five susceptibility geographical areas in the United States where different sets of pathogens tend to occur.

AB Tuberculosis (TB) elimination requires innovative approaches. The new Global Tuberculosis Network (GTN) aims to conduct research on key unmet therapeutic and diagnostic needs in the field of TB elimination using multidisciplinary, multisectorial approaches. The TB Pharmacology section within the new GTN aims to detect and study the current knowledge gaps, test potential solutions using human pharmacokinetics informed through preclinical infection systems, and return those findings to the bedside. Moreover, this approach would allow prospective identification and validation of optimal shorter therapeutic durations with new regimens. Optimized treatment using available and repurposed drugs may have an increased impact when prioritizing a person-centered approach and acknowledge the importance of age, gender, comorbidities, and both social and programmatic environments. In this viewpoint article, we present an in-depth discussion on how TB pharmacology and the related strategies will contribute to TB elimination.

AB Respiratory load compensation is a sensory-motor reflex generated in the brain stem respiratory neural network. The nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) is thought to be the primary structure to process the respiratory load-related afferent activity and contribute to the modification of the breathing pattern by sending efferent projections to other structures in the brain stem respiratory neural network. The sensory pathway and motor responses of respiratory load compensation have been studied extensively; however, the mechanism of neurogenesis of load compensation is still unknown. A variety of studies has shown that inhibitory interconnections among the brain stem respiratory groups play critical roles for the genesis of respiratory rhythm and pattern. The purpose of this study was to examine whether inhibitory glycinergic neurons in the NTS were activated by external and transient tracheal occlusions (ETTO) in anesthetized animals. The results showed that ETTO produced load compensation responses with increased inspiratory, expiratory, and total breath time, as well as elevated activation of inhibitory glycinergic neurons in the caudal NTS (cNTS) and intermediate NTS (iNTS). Vagotomized animals receiving transient respiratory loads did not exhibit these load compensation responses. In addition, vagotomy significantly reduced the activation of inhibitory glycinergic neurons in the cNTS and iNTS. The results suggest that these activated inhibitory glycinergic neurons in the NTS might be essential for the neurogenesis of load compensation responses in anesthetized animals.

AB Morphological Associative Memories (MAM) are a construct similar to Hopfield Associative Memories defined on the (R, +, boolean OR, boolean AND) algebraic system. The MAM posses excellent recall properties for undistorted patterns. However they suffer from the sensitivity to specific noise models, that can be characterized as erosive and dilative noise. We find that this sensitivity may be made of use in the task of Endmember determination for the Spectral Unmixing of Hyperspectral Images.

AB Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) is an advanced CT computed tomography scanning technique enabling material characterization not possible with conventional CT scans. It allows the reconstruction of energy decay curves at each 3D image voxel, representing varied image attenuation at different effective scanning energy levels. In this paper, we develop novel unsupervised learning techniques based on mixture models and functional data analysis models to the clustering of DECT images. We design functional mixture models that integrate spatial image context in mixture weights, with mixture component densities being constructed upon the DECT energy decay curves as functional observations. We develop dedicated expectation-maximization algorithms for the maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters. To our knowledge, this is the first article to develop statistical functional data analysis and model-based clustering techniques to take advantage of the full spectral information provided by DECT. We evaluate the application of DECT to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Current image-based evaluation of these tumors in clinical practice is largely qualitative, based on a visual assessment of tumor anatomic extent and basic one- or two-dimensional tumor size measurements. We evaluate our methods on 91 head and neck cancer DECT scans and compare our unsupervised clustering results to tumor contours traced manually by radiologists, as well as to several baseline algorithms. Given the inter-rater variability even among experts at delineating head and neck tumors, and given the potential importance of tissue reactions surrounding the tumor itself, our proposed methodology has the potential to add value in downstream machine learning applications for clinical outcome prediction based on DECT data in head and neck cancer.

AB Over the past decade, the role of the gut microbiota in many disease states has gained a great deal of attention. Mounting evidence from case-control and observational studies has linked changes in the gut microbiota to the pathophysiology of osteoporosis (OP). Nonetheless, the results of these studies contain discrepancies, leaving the literature without a consensus on osteoporosis-associated microbial signatures. Here, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis combining and reexamining five publicly available 16S rRNA partial sequence data sets to identify gut bacteria consistently associated with osteoporosis across different cohorts. After adjusting for the batch effect associated with technical variation and heterogeneity of studies, we observed a significant shift in the microbiota composition in the osteoporosis group. An increase in the relative abundance of opportunistic pathogens Clostridium sensu stricto, Bacteroides, and Intestinibacter was observed in the OP group. Moreover, short-chain-fatty-acid (SCFA) producers, including members of the genera Collinsella, Megasphaera, Agathobaculum, Mediterraneibacter, Clostridium XIV, and Dorea, were depleted in the OP group relative to the healthy control (HC) group. Lactic acid-producing bacteria, including Limosilactobacillus, were significantly increased in the OP group. The random forest algorithm further confirmed that these bacteria differentiate the two groups. Furthermore, functional prediction revealed depletion of the SCFA biosynthesis pathway (glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid [TCA] cycle, and Wood-Ljungdahl pathway) and amino acid biosynthesis pathway (methionine, histidine, and arginine) in the OP group relative to the HC group. This study uncovered OP-associated compositional and functional microbial alterations, providing robust insight into OP pathogenesis and aiding the possible development of a therapeutic intervention to manage the disease.IMPORTANCE Osteoporosis is the most common metabolic bone disease associated with aging. Mounting evidence has linked changes in the gut microbiota to the pathophysiology of osteoporosis. However, which microbes are associated with dysbiosis and their impact on bone density and inflammation remain largely unknown due to inconsistent results in the literature. Here, we present a meta-analysis with a standard workflow, robust statistical approaches, and machine learning algorithms to identify notable microbial compositional changes influencing osteoporosis.

AB Recent evidence supports a role for the gut microbiota in hypertension, but whether ambulatory blood pressure is associated with gut microbiota and their metabolites remains unclear. We characterized the function of the gut microbiota, their metabolites and receptors in untreated human hypertensive participants in Australian metropolitan and regional areas. Ambulatory blood pressure, fecal microbiome predicted from 16S rRNA gene sequencing, plasma and fecal metabolites called short-chain fatty acid, and expression of their receptors were analyzed in 70 untreated and otherwise healthy participants from metropolitan and regional communities. Most normotensives were female (66%) compared with hypertensives (35%, P<0.01), but there was no difference in age between the groups (59.2 +/- 7.7 versus 60.3 +/- 6.6 years old). Based on machine learning multivariate covariance analyses of de-noised amplicon sequence variant prevalence data, we determined that there were no significant differences in predicted gut microbiome alpha- and beta-diversity metrics between normotensives versus essential or masked hypertensives. However, select taxa were specific to these groups, notably Acidaminococcus spp., Eubacterium fissicatena, and Muribaculaceae were higher, while Ruminococcus and Eubacterium eligens were lower in hypertensives. Importantly, normotensive and essential hypertensive cohorts could be differentiated based on gut microbiome gene pathways and metabolites. Specifically, hypertensive participants exhibited higher plasma acetate and butyrate, but their immune cells expressed reduced levels of short-chain fatty acid-activated GPR43 (G-protein coupled receptor 43). In conclusion, gut microbial diversity did not change in essential hypertension, but we observed a significant shift in microbial gene pathways. Hypertensive subjects had lower levels of GPR43, putatively blunting their response to blood pressure-lowering metabolites.

ID FEATURE-SELECTION; MUTUAL INFORMATION
AB The matrix-based Renyi's alpha-order entropy functional was recently introduced using the normalized eigenspectrum of a Hermitian matrix of the projected data in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). However, the current theory in the matrix-based Renyi's alpha-order entropy functional only defines the entropy of a single variable or mutual information between two random variables. In information theory and machine learning communities, one is also frequently interested in multivariate information quantities, such as the multivariate joint entropy and different interactive quantities among multiple variables. In this paper, we first define the matrix-based Renyi's alpha-order joint entropy among multiple variables. We then show how this definition can ease the estimation of various information quantities that measure the interactions among multiple variables, such as interactive information and total correlation. We finally present an application to feature selection to show how our definition provides a simple yet powerful way to estimate a widely-acknowledged intractable quantity from data. A real example on hyperspectral image (HSI) band selection is also provided.

AB Detecting and reporting the quality of packaged food to the consumer in real-time can reduce the consumption of poor-quality food products. Current food quality detection and reporting technologies of perishable foods are usually expensive, complicated, and take a significantly long time to convey results. Herein, a real-time, simple, and user-friendly food freshness detection prototype was developed by combining a glycerol-based sensory film with unique visual color analysis and the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (KNN). We established the quantitative relationship between the pH, organic acid level, digital color variance, and food storage time. By measuring the color variations of sensor films as a function of food storage time, we demonstrate a technology to record the quantitative "RGB" values of sensory films to represent real-time and precise pH changes of the food sample and trace the real-time food spoilage degree (e.g., pork loin spoilage). Next, a quick-response (QR) reader with a center sensor film was designed to eliminate the environmental effects on the color variation in real time Furthermore, the KNN was implemented to classify food quality by training data from different sources. This study provides a technology well suited for large-scale food storage applications by combining a smart sensor film with a QR code design followed by image analysis and KNN. This real-time and rapid food quality monitoring technology will ultimately lead to a reduction in food waste and loss (FLW).

AB Background: We propose a new clinical assessment tool constructed using machine learning, called the Shoulder Arthroplasty Smart (SAS) score to quantify outcomes following total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA).
   Methods: Clinical data from 3667 TSA patients with 8104 postoperative follow-up reports were used to quantify the psychometric properties of validity, responsiveness, and clinical interpretability for the proposed SAS score and each of the Simple Shoulder Test (SST), Constant, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Standardized Shoulder Assessment Form (ASES), University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), and Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) scores.
   Results: Convergent construct validity was demonstrated, with all 6 outcome measures being moderately to highly correlated preoperatively and highly correlated postoperatively when quantifying TSA outcomes. The SAS score was most correlated with the UCLA score and least correlated with the SST. No clinical outcome score exhibited significant floor effects preoperatively or postoperatively or significant ceiling effects preoperatively; however, significant ceiling effects occurred postoperatively for each of the SST (44.3%), UCLA (13.9%), ASES (18.7%), and SPADI (19.3%) measures. Ceiling effects were more pronounced for anatomic than reverse TSA, and generally, men, younger patients, and whites who received TSA were more likely to experience a ceiling effect than TSA patients who were female, older, and of non-white race or ethnicity. The SAS score had the least number of patients with floor and ceiling effects and also exhibited no response bias in any patient characteristic analyzed in this study. Regarding clinical interpretability, patient satisfaction anchor-based thresholds for minimal clinically importance difference and substantial clinical benefit were quantified for all 6 outcome measures; the SAS score thresholds were most similar in magnitude to the Constant score. Regarding responsiveness, all 6 outcome measures detected a large effect, with the UCLA exhibiting the most responsiveness and the SST exhibiting the least. Finally, each of the SAS, ASES, Constant, and SPADI scores had similarly large standardized response mean and effect size responsiveness.
   Discussion: The 6-question SAS score is an efficient TSA-specific outcome measure with equivalent or better validity, responsiveness, and clinical interpretability as 5 other historical assessment tools. The SAS score has an appropriate response range without floor or ceiling effects and without bias in any target patient characteristic, unlike the age, gender, or race/ethnicity bias observed in the ceiling scores with the other outcome measures. Because of these substantial benefits, we recommend the use of the new SAS score for quantifying TSA outcomes. (C) 2021 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees. All rights reserved.

AB An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model has been developed for analyzing traffic in an inland waterway network. The main purpose of this paper is to determine how well such a relatively fast model for analyzing a queuing network could substitute for far mon expensive simulation. Its substitutability for simulation is judged by relative discrepancies in predicting tow delays between the ANN and simulation models. This model is developed by integrating five distinct ANN submodels that predict tow headway variances at (1) merge points, (2) branching (i.e., diverging) points, (3) lock exits, and (3) link outflow points (e.g., at ports, junctions, or lock entrances), plus (5) tow queuing delays at locks. Preliminary results are shown for those five submodels and for the integrated network analysis model. Eventually, such a network analyzer should be useful for designing, selecting, sequencing, and scheduling lock improvement projects, for controlling lock operations, for system maintenance planning, and for other applications where many combinations of network characteristics must be evaluated. More generally, this method of decomposing complex queuing networks into elements that can be analyzed with ANNs and then recombined provides a promising approach for analyzing other queuing networks (e.g., in transportation, communication, computing, and production systems).

AB Background Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), is a preventable leading cause of blindness in infants and is a condition in which the immature retina experiences abnormal blood vessel growth. The development of ROP is multifactorial; nevertheless, the risk factors are controversial. This study aimed to identify risk factors of time to development of ROP in Iran. Methods This historical cohort study utilized data from the hospital records of all newborns referred to the ROP department of Farabi Hospital (from 2017 to 2021) and the NICU records of infants referred from Mahdieh Hospital to Farabi Hospital. Preterm infants with birth weight (BW) <= 2000 g or gestational age (GA) < 34 wk, as well as selected infants with an unstable clinical course, as determined by their pediatricians or neonatologists, with BW > 2000 g or GA >= 34 wk. The outcome variable was the time to development of ROP (in weeks). Random survival forest was used to analyze the data. Results A total of 338 cases, including 676 eyes, were evaluated. The mean GA and BW of the study group were 31.59 +/- 2.39 weeks and 1656.72 +/- 453.80 g, respectively. According to the criteria of minimal depth and variable importance, the most significant predictors of the time to development of ROP were duration of ventilation, GA, duration of oxygen supplementation, bilirubin levels, duration of antibiotic administration, duration of Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN), mother age, birth order, number of surfactant administration, and on time screening. The concordance index for predicting survival of the fitted model was 0.878. Conclusion Our findings indicated that the duration of ventilation, GA, duration of oxygen supplementation, bilirubin levels, duration of antibiotic administration, duration of TPN, mother age, birth order, number of surfactant administrations, and on time screening are potential risk factors of prognosis of ROP. The associations between identified risk factors were mostly nonlinear. Therefore, it is recommended to consider the nature of these relationships in managing treatment and designing early interventions.

AB Human in vitro models of neural tissue with tunable microenvironment and defined spatial arrangement are needed to facilitate studies of brain development and disease. Towards this end, embedded printing inside granular gels holds great promise as it allows precise patterning of extremely soft tissue constructs. However, granular printing support formulations are restricted to only a handful of materials. Therefore, there has been a need for novel materials that take advantage of versatile biomimicry of bulk hydrogels while providing high-fidelity support for embedded printing akin to granular gels. To address this need, Authors present a modular platform for bioengineering of neuronal networks via direct embedded 3D printing of human stem cells inside Self-Healing Annealable Particle-Extracellular matrix (SHAPE) composites. SHAPE composites consist of soft microgels immersed in viscous extracellular-matrix solution to enable precise and programmable patterning of human stem cells and consequent generation mature subtype-specific neurons that extend projections into the volume of the annealed support. The developed approach further allows multi-ink deposition, live spatial and temporal monitoring of oxygen levels, as well as creation of vascular-like channels. Due to its modularity and versatility, SHAPE biomanufacturing toolbox has potential to be used in applications beyond functional modeling of mechanically sensitive neural constructs.

AB Although data modeling methods for conceptual cost estimation are proven to be effective in academia, they are not adopted by construction practitioners as expected. To understand this fact and find solutions to the challenge of implementing modeling methods, a review of the modeling process is needed. Fifty-one most relevant studies were filtered out from the Web of Science and ASCE. Referencing two established data mining frameworks, namely, CRISP-DM and KDD, this paper identifies the key tasks of implementing conceptual cost estimation models. The results of reviewing key tasks show that the literature did not provide sufficient solutions to data preparation and model evaluation. Critical judgments on the accomplishment and deficiencies of the current conceptual cost estimation studies, from the perspective of data modeling process for the first time, is the main contribution of this paper. Other contributions include the elaboration of the body of knowledge to guide practitioners to implement advanced cost estimation, as well as recommendations on future studies of improving data quality and integration with data management systems to achieve the data models' best capacity.

AB A reduced kinetic method (RKM) with a first-principles collision operator is introduced in a 1D2V planar geometry and implemented in a computationally inexpensive code to investigate non-local ion heat transport in multi-species plasmas. The RKM successfully reproduces local results for multi-species ion systems and the important features expected to arise due to non-local effects on the heat flux are captured. In addition to this, novel features associated with multi-species, as opposed to single species, cases are found. Effects of non-locality on the heat flux are investigated in mass and charge symmetric and asymmetric ion mixtures with temperature, pressure, and concentration gradients. In particular, the enthalpy flux associated with diffusion is found to be insensitive to sharp pressure and concentration gradients, increasing its significance in comparison to the conductive heat flux driven by temperature gradients in non-local scenarios. The RKM code can be used for investigating other kinetic and non-local effects in a broader plasma physics context. Due to its relatively low computational cost it can also serve as a practical non-local ion heat flux closure in hydrodynamic simulations or as a training tool for machine learning surrogates.

AB Large-scale datacenters are facing increasing pressure of capping their carbon emission and power cost. Many leading-edge studies have started to explore server clusters running on multiple power sources. Existing approaches do not sufficiently consider the fine-grained power delivery to satisfy diverse requirements in datacenter, especially in the multi-tenant/colocation datacenter, which may yield low energy utilization. To address the emerging trend and new requirements, this article proposes a novel Datacenter inner Power Switch Network (DiPSN) to improve datacenter power efficiency and user satisfaction. DiPSN is a reconfigurable and easy-to-scale-out power architecture, which enables datacenter to distribute various power sources in a fine-grained manner. Moreover, a tailored machine learning based power source management framework is proposed for DiPSN to dynamically optimize user customized performance metrics and maximize datacenter revenue. Compared with conventional single-switch power distribution system, our DiPSN can be configured to improve solar energy utilization by 39.6 percent, reduce utility power cost by 11.1 percent and improve workload performance by 33.8 percent. Meanwhile, our design can extend battery lifetime by 9.3 percent. This work could provide valuable guidelines for designing heterogeneous power distribution architecture and management methodology in datacenters for improving user-customizable efficiency, sustainability and economy.

AB Poststroke optogenetic stimulations can promote functional recovery. However, the circuit mechanisms underlying recovery remain unclear. Elucidating key neural circuits involved in recovery will be invaluable for translating neuromodulation strategies after stroke. Here, we used optogenetic functional magnetic resonance imaging to map brain-wide neural circuit dynamics after stroke in mice treated with and without optogenetic excitatory neuronal stimulations in the ipsilesional primary motor cortex (iM1). We identified key sensorimotor circuits affected by stroke. iM1 stimulation treatment restored activation of the ipsilesional corticothalamic and corticocortical circuits, and the extent of activation was correlated with functional recovery. Furthermore, stimulated mice exhibited higher expression of axonal growth-associated protein 43 in the ipsilesional thalamus and showed increased Synaptophysin(+)/channelrhodopsin(+) presynaptic axonal terminals in the corticothalamic circuit. Selective stimulation of the corticothalamic circuit was sufficient to improve functional recovery. Together, these findings suggest early involvement of corticothalamic circuit as an important mediator of poststroke recovery.

AB Photo sharing is an attractive feature which popularizes online social networks (OSNs). Unfortunately, it may leak users' privacy if they are allowed to post, comment, and tag a photo freely. In this paper, we attempt to address this issue and study the scenario when a user shares a photo containing individuals other than himself/herself (termed co-photo for short). To prevent possible privacy leakage of a photo, we design a mechanism to enable each individual in a photo be aware of the posting activity and participate in the decision making on the photo posting. For this purpose, we need an efficient facial recognition (FR) system that can recognize everyone in the photo. However, more demanding privacy setting may limit the number of the photos publicly available to train the FR system. To deal with this dilemma, our mechanism attempts to utilize users' private photos to design a personalized FR system specifically trained to differentiate possible photo co-owners without leaking their privacy. We also develop a distributed consensus-based method to reduce the computational complexity and protect the private training set. We show that our system is superior to other possible approaches in terms of recognition ratio and efficiency. Our mechanism is implemented as a proof of concept Android application on Facebook's platform.

AB This technical note studies a class of distributed nonsmooth convex consensus optimization problems. The cost function is a summation of local cost functions which are convex but nonsmooth. Each of the local cost functions consists of a twice differentiable (smooth) convex function and two lower semi-continuous (nonsmooth) convex functions. We call these problems as single-smooth plus double-nonsmooth (SSDN) problems. Under mild conditions, we propose a distributed double proximal primal-dual optimization algorithm. Double proximal splitting is designed to deal with the difficulty caused by the unproximable property of the summation of those two nonsmooth functions. Besides, it can also guarantee that the proposed algorithm is locally Lipschitz continuous. An auxiliary variable in the double proximal splitting is introduced to estimate the subgradient of the second nonsmooth function. Theoretically, we conduct the convergence analysis by employing Lyapunov stability theory. It shows that the proposed algorithm can make the states achieve consensus at the optimal point. In the end, nontrivial simulations are presented and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB Introduction: Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by motor symptoms whose progression is typically assessed using clinical scales, namely the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). Despite its reliability, the scale is bounded by a 5-point scale that limits its ability to track subtle changes in disease progression and is prone to subjective interpretations. We aimed to develop an automated system to objectively quantify motor symptoms in PD using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to analyze videos and capture nuanced features of disease progression. Methods: We analyzed videos of the Finger Tapping test, a component of the MDS-UPDRS, from 24 healthy controls and 66 PD patients using ML algorithms for hand pose estimation. We computed multiple movement features related to bradykinesia from videos and employed a novel tiered classification approach to predict disease severity that employed different features according to severity. We compared our video-based disease severity prediction approach against other approaches recently introduced in the literature. Results: Traditional kinematics features such as amplitude and velocity changed linearly with disease severity, while other non-traditional features displayed non-linear trends. The proposed disease severity prediction approach demonstrated superior accuracy in detecting PD and distinguishing between different levels of disease severity when compared to existing approaches.

AB Beach advisories are issued to the public in California when the concentration of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB), including total coliform, fecal coliform (or Escherichia coli), and Enterococcus, exceed their recreational water health standards, or when the amount of a rainfall event is above the pre-determined threshold. However, it is not fully understood about how and to what degree stormwater runoff or baseflow exerts impacts on beach water quality. Furthermore, current laboratory methods used to determine the FIB levels take 18-96 h, which is too slow to keep pace with changes in FIB levels in water. Thus, a beach may not be posted when it is contaminated, and may be posted under advisory when bacterial levels have already decreased to within water quality standards. The study was designed to address the above critical issues. There were large temporal and spatial variations in FIB concentrations along two popular State Beaches in San Diego, CA, USA. The rainstorm-induced runoff from the watersheds exerts significant impacts on the marine recreational water quality of the beaches adjacent to lagoons during the first 24-48 h after a rain event. The large volume of stormwater runoff discharging to beaches caused high FIB concentrations in beach water not only at the lagoon outlet channel and the mixing zone, but also at the locations 90 m away from the channel northward or southward along the shoreline. The geomorphology of beach shoreline, distance from the outlet channel, wind strength, wind direction, tide height, wave height, rainfall, time lapse after a rainstorm, or channel flow rate played a role in affecting the distribution of FIB concentrations in beach water. Despite the great temporal and spatial variability of FIB concentrations along a shoreline, the artificial neural network-based models developed in this study are capable of successfully predicting FIB concentrations at different beaches, different locations, and different times under baseflow or rainstorm conditions. The models are based on readily measurable variables including temperature, conductivity, pH, turbidity, channel water flow, rainfall, and/or time lapse after a rainstorm. The established models will help fill the current gap between beach posting and actual water quality and make more meaningful and effective decisions on beach closures and advisories.

AB Web search engines have become an integral part of the daily life of a knowledge worker, who depends on these search engines to retrieve relevant information from the Web or from the company's vast document databases. Current search engines are very fast in terms of their response time to a user query. But their usefulness to the user in terms of retrieval performance leaves a lot to be desired. Typically, the user has to sift through a lot of nonrelevant documents to get only a few relevant ones for the user's information needs. Ranking functions play a very important role in the search engine retrieval performance. In this paper, we describe a methodology using genetic programming to discover new ranking functions for the Web-based information-seeking task. We exploit the content as well as structural information in the Web documents in the discovery process. The discovery process is carried out for both the ad hoc task and the routing task in retrieval. For either of the retrieval tasks, the retrieval performance of these newly discovered ranking functions has been found to be superior to the performance obtained by well-known ranking strategies in the information retrieval literature.

AB Physicians use perioperative decision-support tools to mitigate risks and maximize benefits to achieve the most successful outcome for patients. Contemporary risk-assessment practices augment surgeons' judgement and experience with decision-support algorithms driven by big data and machine learning. These algorithms accurately assess risk for a wide range of postoperative complications by parsing large datasets and performing complex calculations that would be cumbersome for busy clinicians. Even with these advancements, large gaps in perioperative risk assessment remain; decision-support algorithms often cannot account for risk-reduction therapies applied during a patient's perioperative course and do not quantify tradeoffs between competing goals of care (eg, balancing postoperative pain control with the risk of respiratory depression or balancing intraoperative volume resuscitation with the risk for complications from pulmonary edema). Multiobjective optimization solutions have been applied to similar problems successfully but have not yet been applied to perioperative decision support. Given the large volume of data available via electronic medical records, including intraoperative data, it is now feasible to successfully apply multiobjective optimization in perioperative care. Clinical application of multiobjective optimization would require semiautomated pipelines for analytics and reporting model outputs and a careful development and validation process. Under these circumstances, multiobjective optimization has the potential to support personalized, patient-centered, shared decision-making with precision and balance. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB Measuring forest biodiversity using terrestrial surveys is expensive and can only capture common species abundance in large heterogeneous landscapes. In contrast, combining airborne imagery with computer vision can generate individual tree data at the scales of hundreds of thousands of trees. To train computer vision models, ground-based species labels are combined with airborne reflectance data. Due to the difficulty of finding rare species in a large landscape, many classification models only include the most abundant species, leading to biased predictions at broad scales. For example, if only common species are used to train the model, this assumes that these samples are representative across the entire landscape. Extending classification models to include rare species requires targeted data collection and algorithmic improvements to overcome large data imbalances between dominant and rare taxa. We use a targeted sampling workflow to the Ordway Swisher Biological Station within the US National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), where traditional forestry plots had identified six canopy tree species with more than 10 individuals at the site. Combining iterative model development with rare species sampling, we extend a training dataset to include 14 species. Using a multi-temporal hierarchical model, we demonstrate the ability to include species predicted at <1% frequency in landscape without losing performance on the dominant species. The final model has over 75% accuracy for 14 species with improved rare species classification compared to 61% accuracy of a baseline deep learning model. After filtering out dead trees, we generate landscape species maps of individual crowns for over 670 000 individual trees. We find distinct patches of forest composed of rarer species at the full-site scale, highlighting the importance of capturing species diversity in training data. We estimate the relative abundance of 14 species within the landscape and provide three measures of uncertainty to generate a range of counts for each species. For example, we estimate that the dominant species, Pinus palustris accounts for c. 28% of predicted stems, with models predicting a range of counts between 160 000 and 210 000 individuals. These maps provide the first estimates of canopy tree diversity within a NEON site to include rare species and provide a blueprint for capturing tree diversity using airborne computer vision at broad scales.

AB While there are many data-driven diagnosis algorithms for fault isolation of complex systems, a new challenge arises in the case of multiple operating regimes. In this case, the diagnosis is usually carried out for each regime for better accuracy. However, the problem is that different results can be derived from each regime and they can conflict with each other, which may invalidate the performance of fault diagnosis. To address this challenge, a methodology for selecting the most reliable one among the different diagnostic results is proposed, which combines the Bayesian network (BN) and the information value (IV). The BN is trained for each regime and a conditional probability table is obtained for probabilistic fault diagnosis. The IV is then employed to evaluate the value of several diagnostic results. The proposed approach is applied to the fault diagnosis of a train door system and its effectiveness is proven.

TI Communication-Efficient and Attack-Resistant Federated Edge Learning
   With Dataset Distillation
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CLOUD COMPUTING
LA English
DT Article
DE Communication reduction; federated learning; one-shot learning; attack
AB Federated Edge Learning considers a large amount of distributed edge nodes collectively train a global gradient-based model for edge computing in the Artificial Internet of Things, which significantly promotes the development of cloud computing. However, current federated learning algorithms take tens of communication rounds transmitting unwieldy model weights under ideal circumstances and hundreds when data is poorly distributed. This drawback directly results in expensive communication overhead for edge devices. Inspired by recent work on dataset distillation and distributed one-shot learning, we propose Distilled One-Shot Federated Learning (DOSFL) to significantly reduce the communication cost while achieving comparable performance. In just one round, each client distills their private dataset, sends the synthetic data to the server, and collectively trains a global model. The distilled data look like noise and are only useful to the specific model weights, i.e., become useless after the model updates. With this weight-less and gradient-less design, the total communication cost of DOSFL is up to three orders of magnitude less than FedAvg while preserving up to 99% performance of centralized training on both vision and language tasks with different models including CNN, LSTM, Transformer, etc. We demonstrate that an eavesdropping attacker cannot properly train a good model using the leaked distilled data, without knowing the initial model weights. DOSFL serves as an inexpensive method to quickly converge on a performant pre-trained model with less than 0.1% communication cost of traditional methods.

   REGRESSION; ENSEMBLE
AB The use of surrogates (also known as metamodels) for facilitating optimization and statistical analysis of computationally expensive simulations has become commonplace. Surrogate models are usually fit to be unbiased (i.e., the error expectation is zero). However, in certain applications, it might be important to safely estimate the response (e.g., in structural analysis, the maximum stress must not he underestimated in order to avoid failure). In this work we use safety margins to conservatively compensate for tilting errors associated with surrogates. We propose the use of cross validation for estimating the required safety margin for a desired level of conservativeness (percentage of safe predictions.). The approach was tested on three algebraic examples for two basic surrogates: namely, kriging and polynomial response surface. For these examples we found that cross validation is effective for selecting the safety margin. We also applied the approach to the probabilistic design optimization of a composite laminate. This design under uncertainty example showed that the approach can be successfully used in engineering applications.

AB Ridesplitting, a shared mobility service, has the potential to reduce traffic-related air pollution. This study evaluates the impacts of ridesplitting on reducing different types of emissions and investigate how travel characteristics of ridesplitting affect emission reduction based on a ride sourcing dataset in Chengdu, China. First, this study quantifies the influence of ridesplitting on emissions reduction compared to single ride (i.e., non-ridesplitting) for each trip. The results indicate that a ridesplitting trip averagely reduce CO2, CO, NOx, and HC emissions by 34.52%, 5.98%, 33.10%, and 13.42%, respectively. Subsequently, using explainable machine learning, we quantitatively analyze how the travel characteristics of ridesplitting affect emission reduction at two levels. At the trip level, shared travel distance, shared travel time, delay, and detour are important factors for emission reduction. At the grid level, the number of orders that match co riders within the same spatial community is more important than the total number of orders.

DE embedded microcomputer; low-cost; management; open-source; water
AB Precision agriculture involves applying artificial intelligence, computers, sensors, and automation to improve crop field productivity while monitoring environmental conditions to conserve soil, water, and other natural resources focusing on agricultural sustainability. Despite many applications in agriculture, data monitoring and recording technologies have limited use due to the price. Low-cost open-source systems, like the ones available with the Internet of things (IoT) world, can potentially be developed as a universal-fit and cloud-connected technology for multiple applications. We designed and built a basic data collecting system using a commercial standalone embedded computer with Python programming language, serial data interface (SDI)-12/analog sensor adaptor, and digital sensors to monitor soil moisture and transmit the data remotely. SDI-12 is a standard communication protocol that transfers digital sensor measurements to a data recorder. We set up a pilot study that automatically collected and uploaded the data into the Internet to allow remote data transfer and access. The system performed reliably over 1 week with potting soil under field conditions without maintenance and successfully recorded data in real-time. The volumetric water content ranged from 0.03 to 0.23 m(3).m(-3), dielectric permittivity from 3.3 to 18.9 (unitless), EC from 0.0 to 0.3 dS.m(-1), and soil temperature from 20.7 to 44.8 degrees C. All the data were successfully collected and uploaded to the cloud every 20 min, allowing users to remotely monitor the data using a free online application. However, heavy rainfall and high insolation could damage the system through excessive moisture or overheating, requiring a waterproof and heavy-duty protection case. The ThingSpeak channel allows customizing to suit a user's specific requirements or adding more features for further development, such as automated irrigation, which can improve irrigation and fertilization efficiency by applying water and fertilizers at the right time based on sensor readings.

ID RBF NEURAL-NETWORK
AB This paper presents a quantized kernel least mean square algorithm with a fixed memory budget, named QKLMS-FB. In order to deal with the growing support inherent in online kernel methods, the proposed algorithm utilizes a pruning criterion, called significance measure, based on a weighted contribution of the existing data centers. The basic idea of the proposed methodology is to discard the center with the smallest influence on the whole system, when a new sample is included in the dictionary. The significance measure can be updated recursively at each step which is suitable for online operation. Furthermore, the proposed methodology does not need any a priori knowledge about the data and its computational complexity is linear with the center number. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm successfully prunes the least "significant" centers and preserves the important ones, resulting in a compact KLMS model with little loss in accuracy.

AB Purpose: Long COVID-19 syndrome occurs in 10-20 % of people after a confirmed/probable SARS-COV-2 infection; new symptoms begin within three months of COVID-19 diagnosis and last > 8 weeks. Little is known about risk factors for long COVID, particularly in older people who are at greater risk of COVID complications. Methods: Data are from Women's Health Initiative (WHI) postmenopausal women who completed COVID surveys that included questions on whether they had ever been diagnosed with COVID and length and nature of symptoms. Long COVID was classified using standard consensus criteria. Using WHI demographic and health data collected at study enrollment (1993-98) through the present day, machine learning identified the top 20 risk factors for long COVID. These variables were tested in logistic regression models. Results: Of n = 37,280 survey respondents, 1237 (mean age = 83 years) reported a positive COVID-19 test and 425 (30 %) reported long COVID. Symptoms included an array of neurological, cardio-pulmonary, musculoskeletal, and general fatigue, and malaise symptoms. Long COVID risk factors included weight loss, physical and mobility limitations, and specific heath conditions (e.g., history of heart valve procedure, rheumatoid arthritis). Conclusions: Knowledge of risk factors for long COVID may be the first step in understanding the etiology of this complex disease.

AB Background:While healthcare utilization data are useful for postmarketing surveillance of drug safety in pregnancy, the start of pregnancy and gestational age at birth are often incompletely recorded or missing. Our objective was to develop and validate a claims-based live birth gestational age algorithm.Methods:Using the Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) linked to birth certificates in three states, we developed four candidate algorithms based on: preterm codes; preterm or postterm codes; timing of prenatal care; and prediction models - using conventional regression and machine-learning approaches with a broad range of prespecified and empirically selected predictors. We assessed algorithm performance based on mean squared error (MSE) and proportion of pregnancies with estimated gestational age within 1 and 2 weeks of the gold standard, defined as the clinical or obstetric estimate of gestation on the birth certificate. We validated the best-performing algorithms against medical records in a nationwide sample. We quantified misclassification of select drug exposure scenarios due to estimated gestational age as positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, and specificity.Results:Among 114,117 eligible pregnancies, the random forest model with all predictors emerged as the best performing algorithm: MSE 1.5; 84.8% within 1 week and 96.3% within 2 weeks, with similar performance in the nationwide validation cohort. For all exposure scenarios, PPVs were > 93.8%, sensitivities > 94.3%, and specificities > 99.4%.Conclusions:We developed a highly accurate algorithm for estimating gestational age among live births in the nationwide MAX data, further supporting the value of these data for drug safety surveillance in pregnancy.

TI Strawberry sweetness and consumer preference are enhanced by specific
   volatile compounds
SO HORTICULTURE RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
AB Breeding crops for improved flavor is challenging due to the high cost of sensory evaluation and the difficulty of connecting sensory experience to chemical composition. The main goal of this study was to identify the chemical drivers of sweetness and consumer liking for fresh strawberries (Fragariaxananassa). Fruit of 148 strawberry samples from cultivars and breeding selections were grown and harvested over seven years and were subjected to both sensory and chemical analyses. Each panel consisted of at least 100 consumers, resulting in more than 15,000 sensory data points per descriptor. Three sugars, two acids and 113 volatile compounds were quantified. Consumer liking was highly associated with sweetness intensity, texture liking, and flavor intensity, but not sourness intensity. Partial least square analyses revealed 20 volatile compounds that increased sweetness perception independently of sugars; 18 volatiles that increased liking independently of sugars; and 15 volatile compounds that had positive effects on both. Machine learning-based predictive models including sugars, acids, and volatiles explained at least 25% more variation in sweetness and liking than models accounting for sugars and acids only. Volatile compounds such as gamma -dodecalactone; 5-hepten-2-one, 6-methyl; and multiple medium-chain fatty acid esters may serve as targets for breeding or quality control attributes for strawberry products. A genetic association study identified two loci controlling ester production, both on linkage group 6A. Co-segregating makers in these regions can be used for increasing multiple esters simultaneously. This study demonstrates a paradigm for improvement of fruit sweetness and flavor in which consumers drive the identification of the most important chemical targets, which in turn drives the discovery of genetic targets for marker-assisted breeding.

AB Understanding how species respond to the environment is essential in ecology, evolution, and conservation. Abiotic factors can influence species responses and the multi-dimensional space of abiotic factors that allows a species to grow represents the environmental niche. While niches are often assumed to be constant and robust, they are most likely changing over time and estimation can be influenced by population biology, sampling intensity, and computation methodology. Here, we used a 12-year time series of survey data to fit annual ecological niche models (ENMs) for 10 marine fish species by using two regression and two machine learning algorithms to evaluate the variation and differentiation of environmental niches. Fitted ENMs were used to develop multi-dimensional annual and pooled hypervolumes that were evaluated over time and across ENM algorithms, species, and years by computing volume, distance, and dissimilarity metrics for each annual estimated niche. We then investigated potential drivers of estimated hypervolume dynamics including species abundance, species occurrence, sampling effort, salinity, red tides severity, and algorithm. Overall, our results revealed that estimated niches varied over time and across ENM, species, and algorithms. Niche estimation was influenced over time by multiple factors suggesting high complexity on niche dynamics interpretation. Species with high occurrence tended to have a closer representation of the pooled niche and years with higher abundance tended to produce niche expansion. ENM algorithm, sampling effort, seawater salinity, and red tides explained the deviations from the pooled niche. Greater sampling effort led to more comprehensive and complete estimates of species niches. High red tides severity triggered niche contraction. Our results emphasize the predictable effects of population, sampling, and environment on species niche estimation and interpretation, and that each should be considered when performing and interpreting ecological niche analyses. Our niche analysis approach may contribute to effectively quantifying and assessing niche dynamics.

AB This paper presents a novel real-time dynamic framework for quantifying time-series structure in spoken words using spikes. Audio signals are converted into multi-channel spike trains using a biologically-inspired leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) spike generator. These spike trains are mapped into a function space of infinite dimension, i.e., a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) using point-process kernels, where a state-space model learns the dynamics of the multidimensional spike input using gradient descent learning. This kernelized recurrent system is very parsimonious and achieves the necessary memory depth via feedback of its internal states when trained discriminatively, utilizing the full context of the phoneme sequence. A main advantage of modeling nonlinear dynamics using state-space trajectories in the RKHS is that it imposes no restriction on the relationship between the exogenous input and its internal state. We are free to choose the input representation with an appropriate kernel, and changing the kernel does not impact the system nor the learning algorithm. Moreover, we show that this novel framework can outperform both traditional hidden Markov model (HMM) speech processing as well as neuromorphic implementations based on spiking neural network (SNN), yielding accurate and ultra-low power word spotters. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate its capabilities using the benchmark TI-46 digit corpus for isolated-word automatic speech recognition (ASR) or keyword spotting. Compared to HMM using Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) front-end without time-derivatives, our MFCC-KAARMA offered improved performance. For spike-train front-end, spike-KAARMA also outperformed state-of-the-art SNN solutions. Furthermore, compared to MFCCs, spike trains provided enhanced noise robustness in certain low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime.

AB Ambulance offload delay (AOD) is a growing health care concern in Canada. It refers to the delay in transferring an ambulance patient to a hospital emergency department (ED) due to ED congestion. It can negatively affect the ability of the ambulance service to respond to future calls and reduce the efficiency of the system when the delay is significant. Using integrated historical data from a partnering hospital and an Emergency Medical Services (EMS) provider, we developed a decision-support tool using a hybrid decision tree model to predict the severity of AOD occurring within 1-5 h in an EMS system. The primary objective of this study is to provide an AOD prediction model based on the current system status, hour of the day, and day of the week. With this information, decision-makers can be proactive with efforts to mitigate AOD. Various prediction models are developed with different focuses and forecast periods. This research demonstrates a novel hybrid decision tree method applied with administrative data in a health care setting. A nave Bayes classifier is first used to remove noisy training observations before decision tree induction. This hybrid decision tree algorithm was tested against the basic classification and regression tree (CART) algorithm, using classification accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity analysis. The results indicate that the hybrid algorithm shows improvements in performance in the classification of the real-world problem. It is anticipated that the prediction model for AOD produced from this study will be directly transferable. It can be generalized to other EMS systems, where predicting AOD is important for efficient operations.

AB We have developed an exploratory model of plan view, millennial-scale headland and bay evolution on rocky coastlines. Cross-shore coastline relief, or amplitude, arises from alongshore differences in sea cliff lithology, where durable, erosion-resistant rocks protrude seaward as headlands and weaker rocks retreat landward as bays. The model is built around two concurrent negative feedbacks that control headland amplitude: (1) wave energy convergence and divergence at headlands and bays, respectively, that increases in intensity as cross-shore amplitude grows and (2) the combined processes of beach sediment production by sea cliff erosion, distribution of sediment to bays by waves, and beach accumulation that buffers sea cliffs from wave attack and limits further sea cliff retreat. Paired with the coastline relief model is a numerical wave transformation model that explores how wave energy is distributed along an embayed coastline. The two models are linked through genetic programming, a machine learning technique that parses wave model results into a tractable input for the coastline model. Using a pool of 4800 wave model simulations, genetic programming yields a function that relates breaking wave power density to cross-shore headland amplitude, offshore wave height, approach angle, and period. The goal of the coastline model is to make simple, but fundamental, scaling arguments on how different variables (such as sea cliff height and composition) affect the equilibrium cross-shore relief of headland and bays. The model's generality highlights the key feedbacks involved in coastline evolution and allows its equations (and model behaviors) to be easily modified by future users.

AB The dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) is an essential neural component for central integration of defense behavior and associated autonomic regulation. Electrical and chemical stimulation of this region results in a significant decrease of inspiratory (Ti) and expiratory (Te) breathing durations. In the present study it was hypothesized that breath timing changes elicited by dPAG activation would modulate respiratory load compensation volume-timing reflexes. The effect of dPAG activation of breathing pattern was investigated using chemical stimulation with microinjection of the excitatory amino acid D,L-homocysteic acid (DLH) or disinhibition with GABA(A) (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptor antagonist bicuculline (BIC) in urethane-anesthetized, spontaneously breathing rats. Volume-timing reflexes were studied using inspiratory and expiratory occlusion before and after DLH or BIC dPAG activation. Both BIC and DLH activation of the dPAG significantly increased breathing frequency. Inspiratory occlusion significantly increased Ti before dPAG activation and DLH and BIC potentiated the relative increase in Ti during occlusion. BIC elicited a greater increase in inspiratory occlusion Ti than DLH. Inspiratory occlusion alone also significantly increased diaphragm EMG activity and this response was potentiated with dPAG activation. Expiratory occlusion significantly increased Te and DLH and BIC potentiated the relative increase in Te during expiratory occlusion. These results suggest that dPAG activation modulates the respiratory neural network, resulting in an increased respiratory drive and a decrease in volume-timing reflex sensitivity.

AB In this paper, a novel machine learning algorithm is presented for disaggregation of satellite soil moisture (SM) based on self-regularized regressive models (SRRMs) using high-resolution correlated information from auxiliary sources. It includes regularized clustering that assigns soft memberships to each pixel at a fine scale followed by a kernel regression that computes the value of the desired variable at all pixels. Coarse-scale remotely sensed SM was disaggregated from 10 to 1 km using land cover (LC), precipitation, land surface temperature, leaf area index, and in situ observations of SM. This algorithm was evaluated using multiscale synthetic observations in NC Florida for heterogeneous agricultural LCs. It was found that the rmse for 96% of the pixels was less than 0.02 m3/ m3. The clusters generated represented the data well and reduced the rmse by up to 40% during periods of high heterogeneity in LC and meteorological conditions. The Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between the true SMand the disaggregated estimates is close to zero, for both vegetated and bare-soil LCs. The disaggregated estimates were compared with those generated by the principle of relevant information (PRI) method. The rmse for the PRI disaggregated estimates is higher than the rmse for the SRRMon each day of the season. The KLD of the disaggregated estimates generated by the SRRMis at least four orders of magnitude lower than those for the PRI disaggregated estimates, whereas the computational time needed was reduced by three times. The results indicate that the SRRM can be used for disaggregating SM with complex nonlinear correlations on a grid with high accuracy.

AB Key messageAn approach for handling visual scores with potential errors and subjectivity in scores was evaluated in simulated and blueberry recurrent selection breeding schemes to assist breeders in their decision-making.AbstractMost genomic prediction methods are based on assumptions of normality due to their simplicity and ease of implementation. However, in plant and animal breeding, continuous traits are often visually scored as categorical traits and analyzed as a Gaussian variable, thus violating the normality assumption, which could affect the prediction of breeding values and the estimation of genetic parameters. In this study, we examined the main challenges of visual scores for genomic prediction and genetic parameter estimation using mixed models, Bayesian, and machine learning methods. We evaluated these approaches using simulated and real breeding data sets. Our contribution in this study is a five-fold demonstration: (i) collecting data using an intermediate number of categories (1-3 and 1-5) is the best strategy, even considering errors associated with visual scores; (ii) Linear Mixed Models and Bayesian Linear Regression are robust to the normality violation, but marginal gains can be achieved when using Bayesian Ordinal Regression Models (BORM) and Random Forest Classification; (iii) genetic parameters are better estimated using BORM; (iv) our conclusions using simulated data are also applicable to real data in autotetraploid blueberry; and (v) a comparison of continuous and categorical phenotypes found that investing in the evaluation of 600-1000 categorical data points with low error, when it is not feasible to collect continuous phenotypes, is a strategy for improving predictive abilities. Our findings suggest the best approaches for effectively using visual scores traits to explore genetic information in breeding programs and highlight the importance of investing in the training of evaluator teams and in high-quality phenotyping.

AB We review the advances of terahertz (THz) science and technology in biophotonics, including related challenges and solutions. The main impediment to THz spectroscopy and imaging in this field is the high absorption of the THz beam in water. Hence, transmission imaging and spectroscopy of thick wet tissue using THz radiation has generally been quite difficult. However, the absorption of THz waves by water molecules is so strong that increasing the power of the THz source can lead to structural and functional changes in tissues, so solutions must go beyond a larger power output. In terms of resolution, THz imaging is superior to ultrasound but inferior to visible light microscopy. Owing to its unique material analysis capabilities, promising diagnosis applications have been demonstrated through THz imaging and spectroscopy. Unfortunately, many applications are limited by beam penetration depth and resolution. Hence, researchers from a wide variety of scientific and technical fields have been actively improving these features through the development of electronic devices and materials. In addition, ground-breaking optical architecture and materials to reduce beam absorption in the optics of a system and generate focused beams with smaller diameters have been proposed. On the software side, image processing techniques to computationally enhance the resolution and quality of THz imaging have been proposed. Data science and machine learning to automate the diagnosis of defects and diseases through processing THz images and spectroscopy data have been proposed. We have reviewed the applications of THz radiation in biophotonics and research achievements toward advancing these applications. A conclusion with a roadmap toward increasing the footprint of the THz technology in biophotonics is also proposed. (C) 2020 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

AB The objective of this study was to investigate the extraction efficiency of 9 natural deep eutectic solvents (NDES) with the assistance of ultrasound for phenolic acids, flavonols, and flavan-3-ols in muscadine grape (Carlos) skins and seeds in comparison to 75% ethanol. Artificial neural networking (ANN) was applied to optimize NDES water content, ultrasonication time, solid-to-solvent ratio, and extraction temperature to achieve the highest extraction yields for ellagic acid, catechin and epicatechin. A newly formulated NDES (#1) consists of choline chloride: levulinic acid: ethylene glycol 1:1:2 and 20% water extracted the highest amount of ellagic acid in the skin at 22.1 mg/g. This yield was 1.73-fold of that by 75% ethanol. A modified NDES (#3) consisting of choline chloride: proline: malic acid 1:1:1 and 30% water extracted the highest amount of catechin (0.61 mg/g) and epicatechin (0.89 mg/g) in the skin, and 2.77 mg/g and 0.37 mg/g in the seed, respectively. The optimal yield of ellagic acid in the skin using NDES #1 was 25.3 mg/g (observed) and 25.3 mg/g (predicted). The optimal yield of (catechin + epicatechin) in seed using NDES #3 was 9.8 mg/g (observed) and 9.6 mg/g (predicted). This study showed the high extraction efficiency of selected NDES for polyphenols under optimized conditions.

AB Characterizing the molecular mechanisms underlying disease symptom expression has been used to improve human health and disease resistance in crops and animal breeds. Quantitative trait loci and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are widely used to identify genomic regions that are involved in disease progression. This study extends traditional GWAS significance tests of host and pathogen marker main effects by utilizing dual-genome reaction norm models to evaluate the importance of host-single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) by pathogen-SNP interactions. Disease symptom severity data from Fusarium ear rot (FER) on maize (Zea mays L.) is used to demonstrate the use of both genomes in genomic selection models for breeding and the identification of loci that interact across organisms to impact FER disease development. Dual genome prediction models improved heritability estimates, error variances, and model accuracy while providing predictions for host-by-pathogen interactions that may be used to test the significance of SNP-SNP interactions. Independent GWAS for maize and Fusarium populations identified significantly associated loci and predictions that were used to evaluate the importance of interactions using two different association tests. Predictions from dual genome models were used to evaluate the significance of the SNP-SNP interactions that may be associated with population structure or polygenic effects. As well, association tests incorporating host and pathogen markers in models that also included genomic relationship matrices were used to account for population structure. Subsequent evaluation of protein-protein interactions from candidate genes near the interacting SNPs provides a further in silico evaluation method to expedite the identification of interacting genes. Plain Language Summary Breeding for disease resistance primarily uses large host plant populations to estimate breeding values of certain plant genotypes. Combining DNA marker data from both host and pathogen populations allows for the identification of markers and genes that impact the progression of disease and those that interact to affect disease severity. Additionally, by including pathogen genomic data into breeding models, the accuracy of disease resistance and virulence predictions improves. This model can also be applied to predict the success of host plant genotypes in novel pathogen environments.

TI Optimizing campus-wide COVID-19 test notifications with interpretable
   wastewater time-series features using machine learning models
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
AB During the COVID-19 pandemic, wastewater surveillance of the SARS CoV-2 virus has been demonstrated to be effective for population surveillance at the county level down to the building level. At the University of California, San Diego, daily high-resolution wastewater surveillance conducted at the building level is being used to identify potential undiagnosed infections and trigger notification of residents and responsive testing, but the optimal determinants for notifications are unknown. To fill this gap, we propose a pipeline for data processing and identifying features of a series of wastewater test results that can predict the presence of COVID-19 in residences associated with the test sites. Using time series of wastewater results and individual testing results during periods of routine asymptomatic testing among UCSD students from 11/2020 to 11/2021, we develop hierarchical classification/decision tree models to select the most informative wastewater features (patterns of results) which predict individual infections. We find that the best predictor of positive individual level tests in residence buildings is whether or not the wastewater samples were positive in at least 3 of the past 7 days. We also demonstrate that the tree models outperform a wide range of other statistical and machine models in predicting the individual COVID-19 infections while preserving interpretability. Results of this study have been used to refine campus-wide guidelines and email notification systems to alert residents of potential infections.

AB Delay discounting reflects a devaluation of delayed long-term benefits but pursuing immediate rewards. Higher discounting rates (h-DR) are found ubiquitous in many diseases and unhealthy conditions, particularly in addiction disorder (AD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and obesity. Thus, h-DR was considered to be a common benchmark across many diseases facilitating to understand one disease to relevant others, which was called trans-disease process. However, the common and specific neural biomarkers associated with this process has not yet been studied well. We performed a voxel-wise task-related neuroimaging meta-analysis to clarify the neural pattern of trans-disease process across AD, ADHD and obesity. We recruited 19 eligible papers, including 9 AD papers (154 patients), 6 ADHD papers (106 patients) and 4 obesity studies (94 patients). Neuroimaging meta-analysis demonstrated the presence of neural biomarkers of trans-disease process: these patients showed inadequate brain response in caudate, ventromedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) than do of healthy controls (HCs). Disease-specific neural patterns were also found, with prominent hypoactivation in parahippocampal-striatum network for AD, hyperactivation in dopamine-projection striatum network for ADHD and decreased activity in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and dlPFC for obesity. This study provided robust evidence to reveal the neural substrates of trans-disease process, as well further promoted the triple brain network model in favor of the theoretical developments of these neuropsychiatric disorders.

ID SPINAL-FUSION; RISK-FACTORS
AB OBJECTIVE Postoperative urinary retention (POUR) is a common complication after spine surgery and is associated with prolongation of hospital stay, increased hospital cost, increased rate of urinary tract infection, bladder over-distention, and autonomic dysregulation. POUR incidence following spine surgery ranges between 5.6% and 38%; no reliable prediction tool to identify those at higher risk is available, and that constitutes an important gap in the literature. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a preoperative risk model to predict the occurrence of POUR following routine elective spine surgery.
   METHODS The authors conducted a retrospective chart review of consecutive adults who underwent lumbar spine surgery between June 1, 2017, and June 1, 2019. Patient characteristics, preexisting ICD-10 codes, preoperative pain and opioid use, preoperative alpha-1 blocker use, details of surgical planning, development of POUR, and management strategies were abstracted from electronic medical records. A binomial logistic model and a multilayer perceptron (MLP) were optimized using training and validation sets. The models' performance was then evaluated on model-naive patients (not a part of either cohort). The models were then stacked to take advantage of each model's strengths and to avoid their weaknesses. Four additional models were developed from previously published models adjusted to include only relevant factors (i.e., factors known preoperatively and applied to the lumbar spine).
   RESULTS Overall, 891 patients were included in the cohort, with a mean of 59.6 +/- 15.5 years of age, 52.7% male, BMI 30.4 +/- 6.4, American Society of Anesthesiologists class 2.8 +/- 0.6, and a mean of 5.6 +/- 5.7 comorbidities. The rate of POUR was found to be 25.9%. The two models were comparable, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.737 for the regression model and 0.735 for the neural network. By combining the two models, an AUC of 0.753 was achieved. With a regression model probability cutoff of 0.24 and a neural network cutoff of 0.23, maximal sensitivity and specificity were achieved, with specificity 68.2%, sensitivity 72.9%, negative predictive value 88.2%, and positive predictive value 43.4%. Both models individually outperformed previously published models (AUC 0.516-0.645) when applied to the current data set.
   CONCLUSIONS This predictive model can be a powerful preoperative tool in predicting patients who will be likely to develop POUR. By using a combination of regression and neural network modeling, good sensitivity, specificity, and NPV are achieved.

TI A Spectral Transfer Function to Harmonize Existing Soil Spectral
   Libraries Generated by Different Protocols
SO APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL SOIL SCIENCE
LA English

ID REFLECTANCE; SPECTROSCOPY; PREDICTION; QUALITY
AB Soil spectral libraries (SSLs) are important big-data archives (spectra associated with soil properties) that are analyzed via machine-learning algorithms to estimate soil attributes. Since different spectral measurement protocols are applied when constructing SSLs, it is necessary to examine harmonization techniques to merge the data. In recent years, several techniques for harmonization have been proposed, among which the internal soil standard (ISS) protocol is the most largely applied and has demonstrated its capacity to rectify systematic effects during spectral measurements. Here, we postulate that a spectral transfer function (TF) can be extracted between existing (old) SSLs if a subset of samples from two (or more) different SSLs are remeasured using the ISS protocol. A machine-learning TF strategy was developed, assembling random forest (RF) spectral-based models to predict the ISS spectral condition using soil samples from two existing SSLs. These SSLs had already been measured using different protocols without any ISS treatment the Brazilian (BSSL, generated in 2019) and the European (LUCAS, generated in 2009-2012) SSLs. To verify the TF's ability to improve the spectral assessment of soil attributes after harmonizing the different SSLs' protocols, RF spectral-based models for estimating organic carbon (OC) in soil were developed. The results showed high spectral similarities between the ISS and the ISS-TF spectral observations, indicating that post-ISS rectification is possible. Furthermore, after merging the SSLs with the TFs, the spectral-based assessment of OC was considerably improved, from R-2 = 0.61, RMSE (g/kg) = 12.46 to R-2 = 0.69, RMSE (g/kg) = 11.13. Given our results, this paper enhances the importance of soil spectroscopy by contributing to analyses in remote sensing, soil surveys, and digital soil mapping.

AB Aim: The action to control cardiovascular risk in diabetes (ACCORD) trial showed a neutral average treatment effect of intensive blood glucose and blood pressure (BP) controls in preventing major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Yet, treatment effects across patient subgroups have not been well understood. We aimed to identify patient subgroups that might benefit from intensive glucose or BP controls for preventing MACE. Materials and methods: As a post-hoc analysis of the ACCORD trial, we included 10 251 individuals with type 2 diabetes. We applied causal forest and causal tree models to identify participant characteristics that modify the efficacy of intensive glucose or BP controls from 68 candidate variables (demographics, comorbidities, medications and biomarkers) at the baseline. The exposure was (a) intensive versus standard glucose control [glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) <6.0% vs. 7.0%-7.9%], and (b) intensive versus standard BP control (systolic BP <120 vs. <140 mmHg). The primary outcome was MACE. Results: Compared with standard glucose control, intensive one reduced MACE in those with baseline HbA1c <8.5% [relative risk (RR): 0.79, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.67-0.93] and those with estimated glomerular filtration rate >= 106 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (RR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.55-0.99). Intensive BP control reduced MACE in those with normal high-density lipoprotein levels (women >55 mg/dl, men >45 mg/dl; RR: 0.51, 95% CI: 0.34-0.74). Risk reductions were not significant in other patient subgroups. Conclusions: Our findings suggest heterogeneous treatment effects of intensive glucose and BP control and could provide biomarkers for future clinical trials to identify more precise HbA1c and BP treatment goals for individualized medicine.

AB Detection of immature peach fruits would help growers to create yield maps which are very useful tools for adjusting management practices during the fruit maturing stages. Machine vision algorithms were developed to detect and count immature peach fruit in natural canopies using colour images. This study was the first effort to detect immature peach fruit in natural environment to the authors' knowledge. Captured images had various illumination conditions due to both direct sunlight and diffusive light conditions that make the fruit detection task more difficult. A training set and a validation set were used to develop and to test the algorithms. Different image scanning methods including finding potential fruit regions were developed and used to parse fruit objects in the natural canopy image. Circular Gabor texture analysis and 'eigenfruit' approach (inspired by the 'eigenface' face detection and recognition method) were used for feature extraction. Statistical classifiers, a neural network and a support vector machine classifier were built and used for detecting peach fruit. A blob analysis was performed to merge multiple detections for the same peach fruit. Performance of the classifiers and image scanning methods were introduced and evaluated. Using the proposed algorithms, 84.6, 77.9 and 71.2 % of the actual fruits were successfully detected using three different image scanning methods for the validation set.

AB Dopamine regulates normal functions such as movement, reinforcement learning, and cognition, and its dysfunction has been implicated in multiple psychiatric and neurological disorders. Dopamine acts through D1-(D1R and D5R) and D2-class (D2R, D3R, and D4R) receptors and activates both G protein- and beta-arrestin-dependent signaling pathways. Current dopamine receptor-based therapies are used to ameliorate motor deficits in Parkinson's disease or as antipsychotic medications for schizophrenia. These drugs show efficacy for ameliorating only some symptoms caused by dopamine dysfunction and are plagued by debilitating side effects. Studies in primates and rodents have shown that shifting the balance of dopamine receptor signaling toward the arrestin pathway can be beneficial for inducing normal movement, while reducing motor side effects such as dyskinesias, and can be efficacious at enhancing cognitive function compared to balanced agonists. Several structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies have embarked on discovering beta-arrestin-biased dopamine agonists, focused on D2 partial agonists, noncatechol D1 agonists, and mixed D1/D2R dopamine receptor agonists. Here, we describe an SAR study to identify novel D1R beta-arrestin-biased ligands using A-86929, a high-affinity D1R catechol agonist, as a core scaffold to identify chemical motifs responsible for beta-arrestin-biased activity at both D1 and D2Rs. Most of the A-86929 analogs screened were G protein-biased, but none of them were exclusively arrestin-biased. Additionally, various small-fragment molecular probes displayed weak bias toward the beta-arrestin pathway. Continued in-depth SFSR (structure-functional selectivity relationship) studies informed by structure determination, molecular modeling, and mutagenesis studies will facilitate the discovery of potent and efficacious arrestin-biased dopamine receptor ligands.

AB In the era of big data, ecologists are increasingly relying on computational approaches and tools to answer existing questions and pose new research questions. These include both software applications (e.g., simulation models, databases and machine learning algorithms) and hardware systems (e.g., wireless sensor networks, supercomputing, drones and satellites), motivating the need for greater collaboration between computer scientists and ecologists. Here, we outline some synergistic opportunities for scientists in both disciplines that can be gained by building collaborations between the computer science and ecology research communities, with a focus on the benefits to ecology specifically. We also identify past contributions of computer science to ecology, including high-frequency environmental sensor technology, advanced supercomputing capacity for ecological modeling, databases for long-term and high-frequency datasets, and software programs for ecological analyses, to anticipate future potential contributions. These examples highlight the power and potential for further integration of computer science technology and ideas into the ecological research community. Finally, we translate our own experiences working together as a team of computer scientists and ecologists over the past decade into a conceptual framework with recommendations for supporting productive collaborations at the interface of the two disciplines. We specifically focus on how to apply best practices of team science for bridging computer science and ecology, which we advocate will substantially benefit ecology long-term.

AB Contemporary agricultural systems are poised to transition from linear to circular, adopting concepts of recycling, repurposing, and regeneration. This transition will require changing crop improvement objectives to consider the entire system, and thus provide solutions to improve complex systems for higher productivity, resource use efficiency, and environmental quality. The methods and approaches that underpinned the doubling of yields during the last century may no longer be fully adequate to target crop improvement for circular agricultural systems. Here we propose a multidimensional framework for prediction with outcomes useful to assess both crop performance traits and environmental sustainability of the designed agricultural systems. The study focuses on maize harvestable grain yield and total carbon production, water use, and use efficiency for yield and carbon. The framework builds on the crop growth model whole genome prediction system, which is enabled by advanced phenomics and the integration of symbolic and sub-symbolic artificial intelligence. We demonstrate the approach and prediction accuracy advantages over a standard statistical genomic prediction approach used to breed maize hybrids for yield, flowering time, and kernel set using a dataset comprised of 7004 hybrids, 103 breeding populations, and 62 environments resulting from six years of experimentation in maize drought breeding in the U.S. We propose this framework to motivate a dialogue for how to enable circularity in agriculture through prediction-based systems design.

AB beta-Ga2O3 is an ultrawide bandgap semiconductor that is attracting much attention for applications in next-generation high-power, deep UV, and extreme-environment devices. Hydrogen impurities have been found to have a strong effect on the electrical properties of beta-Ga2O3. This Tutorial is a survey of what has been learned about O-H centers in beta-Ga2O3 from their vibrational properties. More than a dozen, O-H centers have been discovered by infrared absorption spectroscopy. Theory predicts defect structures with H trapped at split configurations of a Ga(1) vacancy that are consistent with the isotope and polarization dependence of the O-H vibrational spectra that have been measured by experiment. Furthermore, O-H centers in beta-Ga2O3 have been found to evolve upon thermal annealing, giving defect reactions that modify conductivity. While much progress has been made toward understanding the microscopic properties and reactions of O-H centers in beta-Ga2O3, many questions are discussed that remain unanswered. A goal of this Tutorial is to inspire future research that might solve these puzzles.

AB Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is considered a safe and well tolerated surgical procedure to alleviate Parkinson's disease (PD) and other movement disorders symptoms along with some psychiatric conditions. Over the last few decades DBS has been shown to provide remarkable therapeutic effect on carefully selected patients. Although its precise mechanism of action is still unknown, DBS improves motor functions and therefore quality of life. To date, two main targets have emerged in PD patients: the globus pallidus pars interna and the subthalamic nucleus. Two other targets, the ventralis intermedius and zona incerta have also been selectively used, especially in tremor-dominant PD patients. The main indications for PD DBS have traditionally been motor fluctuations, debilitating medication induced dyskinesias, unpredictable "off time" state, and medication refractory tremor. Medication refractory tremor and intolerable dyskinesia are potential palliative indications. Besides aforementioned targets, the brainstem pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) is under investigation for the treatment of ON-state freezing of gait and postural instability. In this article, we will review the most recent literature on DBS therapy for PD, including cutting-edge advances and data supporting the role of DBS in advanced neural-network modulation.

AB It has been hypothesized that concurrent exposure to pyridostigmine bromide and permethrin may have contributed to the development of neurocognitive symptoms in Gulf War veterans. The present experiment was designed to investigate the effects of pyridostigmine bromide and permethrin alone, or in combination, on the acquisition of a novel response, one measure of normal cognitive functioning. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with pyridostigmine bromide (1.5 mg/kg/day, by gavage in a volume of 5 ml/kg) or its vehicle for 7 consecutive days. They then also received an intraperitoneal injection of permethrin (0, 15, or 60 mg/kg) before they were exposed to an experimental session during which they could earn food by pressing a lever in an operant chamber. Serum permethrin levels increased as a function of its dose, and were higher in rats treated with pyridostigmine bromide. Sex differences were observed as permethrin levels were higher in female rats than in male rats following the highest dose. Pyridostigmine bromide delayed response acquisition in male and female rats, and resulted in higher response rates on the inactive lever in female rats than in male rats. Although permethrin levels were higher in subjects treated with pyridostigmine bromide than in those treated with vehicle, there were no differences in the behavioral effects of permethrin. Whether or not these behavioral effects of pyridostigmine bromide are of central or peripheral origin will need to he determined in future studies, as its effects on motor activity and/or gastro-intestinal motility may have affected response acquisition.

AB We study the impact of an agricultural microcredit program on the livelihoods of small, marginal, and landless tenant farmers in Bangladesh based on a Randomized Control Trial (RCT). Twenty percent of eligible households acquire at least one loan from the program within two years of the start of the intervention. Results show that access to credit has positive but imprecisely estimated effects on adoption of modern varieties (MV) of rice as well as rice yield. The microcredit program increases crop farm income but has no significant effect on total income or expenditure. Although the program does not have a significant effect on most economic outcomes, it demonstrates an increase in farm activities among the targeted farmers. Our study suggests that facilitating access to credit without addressing other constraints may not be enough to increase investment and profits of tenant farmers.

AB Patterns of human immune responses to viruses and bacteria and how this impacts risk of infections or onset/exacerbation of chronic respiratory diseases are poorly understood. In a population-based birth cohort, we measured peripheral blood mononuclear cell responses (28 cytokines) to respiratory viruses and bacteria, Toll-like receptor ligands and phytohemagglutinin, in 307 children. Cytokine responses were highly variable with > 1000-fold differences between children. Machine learning revealed clear distinction between virus-associated and bacteria-associated stimuli. Cytokines clustered into three functional groups (anti-viral, pro-inflammatory and T-cell derived). To investigate mechanisms potentially explaining such variable responses, we investigated cytokine Quantitative Trait Loci (cQTLs) of IL-6 responses to bacteria and identified nine (eight novel) loci. Our integrative approach describing stimuli, cytokines and children as variables revealed robust immunologically and microbiologically plausible clustering, providing a framework for a greater understanding of host-responses to infection, including novel genetic associations with respiratory disease.

AB Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models trained on natural protein sequences have been used to design functional enzymes. However, their ability to predict individual reaction steps in enzyme catalysis remains unclear, limiting the potential use of sequence information for enzyme engineering. In this study, we demonstrated that sequence information can predict the rate of the SN2 step of a haloalkane dehalogenase using a generative maximum-entropy (MaxEnt) model. We then designed lower-order protein variants of haloalkane dehalogenase using the model. Kinetic measurements confirmed the successful design of protein variants that enhance catalytic activity, above that of the wild type, in the overall reaction and in particular in the SN2 step. On the simulation side, we provided molecular insights into these designs for the SN2 step using the empirical valence bond (EVB) and metadynamics simulations. The EVB calculations showed activation barriers consistent with experimental reaction rates, while examining the effect of amino acid replacements on the electrostatic effect on the activation barrier and the consequence of water penetration, as well as the extent of ground state destabilization/stabilization. Metadynamics simulations emphasize the importance of the substrate positioning in enzyme catalysis. Overall, our AI-guided approach successfully enabled the design of a variant with a faster rate for the SN2 step than the wild-type enzyme, despite haloalkane dehalogenase being extensively optimized through natural evolution.

AB Background:
   Vestibular and ocular symptoms in sport-related concussions are common. The Vestibular/Ocular-Motor Screening (VOMS) tool is a rapid, free, pen-and-paper tool that directly assesses these symptoms and shows consistent utility in concussion identification, prognosis, and management. However, a VOMS validation study in the acute concussion period of a large sample is lacking.
   Purpose:
   To examine VOMS validity among collegiate student-athletes, concussed and nonconcussed, from the multisite National Collegiate Athletic Association-Department of Defense Concussion Assessment, Research and Education (CARE) Consortium. A secondary aim was to utilize multidimensional machine learning pattern classifiers to deduce the additive power of the VOMS in relation to components of the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 3 (SCAT3).
   Study Design:
   Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 3.
   Methods:
   Preseason and acute concussion assessments were analyzed for 419 student-athletes. Variables in the analysis included the VOMS, Balance Error Scoring System, Standardized Assessment of Concussion, and SCAT3 symptom evaluation score. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all tools, including Kolmogorov-Smirnov significance and Cohen d effect size. Correlations between tools were analyzed with Spearman r, and predictive accuracy was evaluated through an Ada Boosted Tree machine learning model's generated receiver operating characteristic curves.
   Results:
   Total VOMS scores and SCAT3 symptom scores demonstrated significant increases in the acute concussion time frame (Cohen d = 1.23 and 1.06; P < .0001), whereas the Balance Error Scoring System lacked clinical significance (Cohen d = 0.17). Incorporation of VOMS into the full SCAT3 significantly boosted overall diagnostic ability by 4.4% to an area under the curve of 0.848 (P < .0001) and produced a 9% improvement in test sensitivity over the existing SCAT3 battery.
   Conclusion:
   The results from this study highlight the relevance of the vestibular and oculomotor systems to concussion and the utility of the VOMS tool. Given the 3.8 million sports-related and 45,121 military-related concussions per year, the addition of VOMS to the SCAT3 is poised to identify up to an additional 304,000 athletes and 3610 servicemembers annually who are concussed, thereby improving concussion assessment and diagnostic rates. Health care providers should consider the addition of VOMS to their concussion assessment toolkits, as its use can positively affect assessment and management of concussions, which may ultimately improve outcomes for this complex and common injury.

AB Groundwater levels across parts of western Kansas have been declining at unsustainable rates due to pumping for agricultural irrigation despite water-saving efforts. Accelerating this decline is the complex agricultural landscape, consisting of both categorical (e.g., management boundaries) and numerical (e.g., crop prices) factors that drive irrigation decisions, making integrated water budget management a challenge. Furthermore, these factors frequently change through time, rendering management strategies outdated within relatively short time scales. This study uses boosted regression trees to simultaneously analyze categorical and numerical data against annual irrigation pumping to determine the relative influence of each factor on groundwater pumping across both space and time. In all, 45 key water use variables covering approximately 19,000 groundwater wells were tested against irrigation pumping from 2006 to 2016 across five categories: (1) management/policy, (2) hydrology, (3) weather, (4) land/agriculture, and (5) economics. Study results showed that variables from all five categories were included among the top 10 drivers to irrigation, and the greatest influence came from variables such as irrigated area per well, saturated thickness, soil permeability, summer precipitation, and pumping costs (depth to water table). Variables that had little influence included regional management boundaries and irrigation technology. The results of this study are further used to target the factors that statistically lead to the greatest volumes of groundwater pumping to help develop robust management strategy suggestions and achieve water management goals of the region.

AB Background: Multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) examines fMRI activation patterns associated with different cognitive conditions. Support vector machines (SVMs) are the predominant method in MVPA. While SVM is intuitive and easy to apply, it is mainly suitable for analyzing data that are linearly separable. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are known to have the ability to approximate nonlinear relationships. Applications of CNN to fMRI data are beginning to appear with increasing frequency, but our understanding of the similarities and differences between CNN models and SVM models is limited.New method: We compared the two methods when they are applied to the same datasets. Two datasets were considered: (1) fMRI data collected from participants during a cued visual spatial attention task and (2) fMRI data collected from participants viewing natural images containing varying degrees of affective content.Results: We found that (1) both SVM and CNN are able to achieve above-chance decoding accuracies for attention control and emotion processing in both the primary visual cortex and the whole brain, (2) the CNN decoding accuracies are consistently higher than that of the SVM, (3) the SVM and CNN decoding accuracies are generally not correlated, and (4) the heatmaps derived from SVM and CNN are not significantly overlapping. Comparison with existing methods: By comparing SVM and CNN we pointed out the similarities and differences between the two methods.Conclusions: SVM and CNN rely on different neural features for classification. Applying both to the same data may yield a more comprehensive understanding of neuroimaging data.

AB Behavioral studies using delay and social discounting as indices of self-control and altruism, respectively, have revealed functional similarities between farsighted and social decisions. However, neural evidence for this functional link is lacking. Twenty-five young adults completed a delay and social discounting task during fMRI scanning. A spatiotemporal partial least squares analysis revealed that both forms of discounting were well characterized by a pattern of brain activity in areas comprising frontoparietal control, default, and mesolimbic reward networks. Both forms of discounting appear to draw on common neurocognitive mechanisms, regardless of whether choices involve intertemporal or interpersonal outcomes. We also observed neural profiles differentiating between high and low discounters. High discounters were well characterized by increased medial temporal lobe and limbic activity. In contrast, low discount rates were associated with activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and right temporoparietal junction. This pattern may reflect biological mechanisms underlying behavioral heterogeneity in discount rates.

AB Solutions phi(x) of the functional equation phi(phi(x)) = f (x) are called iterative roots of the given function f (x). They are of interest in dynamical systems, chaos and complexity theory and also in the modeling of certain industrial and financial processes. The problem of computing this "square root" of a function or operator remains a hard task. While the theory of functional equations provides some insight for real and complex valued functions, iterative roots of nonlinear mappings from to are less studied from a theoretical and computational point of view. Here we prove existence of iterative roots of a certain class of monotone mappings in spaces and demonstrate how a method based on neural networks can find solutions to some examples that arise from simple physical dynamical systems.

AB Floodplain characteristics contribute to the natural regeneration of vegetation and help facilitate their ecosystem recovery but vary within and between river systems and more so in a river system recovering from anthropogenic disturbances. Here, we explored the floodplain characteristics that contribute to the woody vegetation regeneration on point bars of the middle reach of the Apalachicola River in Florida, USA, which has been passively recovering for over two decades after dredging and disposal activities ended. Woody vegetation regeneration on point bars was analysed using 1999 and 2019 aerial imagery and divided into zones and sections. Data were extracted from a digitized geodatabase regarding several floodplain characteristics with potential to influence vegetation regenetation. Later, we analysed noncollinear floodplain characteristics using a random forest (RF) regression model. The top characteristics that contributed to the RF model include vegetation density, distance-to-seeding source and bend curvature. Findings suggest that high vegetation density contributes substantially to woody vegetation regeneration. The negative relationship between distance-to-seeding source and vegetation regeneration shows the importance of seeding availability. The bend curvature corresponds with the highest regeneration in the lowermost section of point bars. Our results signify the importance of maintaining healthy vegetated corridors as a buffer to reinforce the vegetation community and potential seed source for passive recovery. These findings regarding floodplain characteristics can be applied to future active restoration of anthropogenically disturbed floodplains.

ID ROTATIONAL SPECTRA; LOW-TEMPERATURE; DIPOLE-MOMENT; RADICALS; MOLECULES;
   ISOMERS
AB Using chirped and cavity microwave spectroscopies, automated double resonance, new high-speed fitting and deep learning algorithms, and large databases of computed structures, the discharge products of benzene alone, or in combination with molecular oxygen or nitrogen, have been exhaustively characterized between 6.5 and 26 GHz. In total, more than 3300 spectral features were observed; 89% of these, accounting for 97% of the total intensity, have now been assigned to 152 distinct chemical species and 60 of their variants (i.e., isotopic species and vibrationally excited states). Roughly 50 of the products are entirely new or poorly characterized at high resolution, including many heavier by mass than the precursor benzene. These findings provide direct evidence for a rich architecture of two- and three-dimensional carbon and indicate that benzene growth, particularly the formation of ring-chain molecules, occurs facilely under our experimental conditions. The present analysis also illustrates the utility of microwave spectroscopy as a precision tool for complex mixture analysis, irrespective of whether the rotational spectrum of a product species is known a priori or not. From this large quantity of data, for example, it is possible to determine with confidence the relative abundances of different product masses, but more importantly the relative abundances of different isomers with the same mass. The complementary nature of this type of analysis to traditional mass spectrometry is discussed.

AB Objectives: To determine if an automated superimposition method using six landmarks (Sella, Nasion, Porion, Orbitale, Basion, and Pterygoid) would be more suitable than the traditional SellaNasion (SN) method to evaluate growth changes. Materials and Methods: Serial lateral cephalograms at an average interval of 2.7 years were taken on 268 growing children who had not undergone orthodontic treatment. The T1 and T2 lateral images were manually traced. Three different superimposition methods: Bjo spacing diaeresis rk's structural method, conventional SN, and the multiple landmark (ML) superimposition methods were applied. Bjork's structural method was used as the gold standard. Comparisons among the superimposition methods were carried out by measuring the linear distances between Anterior Nasal Spine, point A, point B, and Pogonion using each superimposition method. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify factors that could affect the accuracy of the superimpositions. Results: The ML superimposition method demonstrated smaller differences from Bjo spacing diaeresis rk's method than the conventional SN method did. Greater differences among the cephalometric landmarks tested resulted when: the designated point was farther from the cranial base, the T1 age was older, and the more time elapsed between T1 and T2. Conclusions: From the results of this study in growing patients, the ML superimposition method seems to be more similar to Bjo spacing diaeresis rk's structural method than the SN superimposition method. A major advantage of the ML method is likely to be that it can be applied automatically and may be just as reliable as manual superimposition methods.

AB Spinal interneurons which discharge in phase with the respiratory cycle have been repeatedly described over the last 50 years. These spinal respiratory interneurons are part of a complex propriospinal network that is synaptically coupled with respiratory motoneurons. This article summarizes current knowledge regarding spinal respiratory interneurons and emphasizes chemical, electrical and physiological methods for activating spinal respiratory neural circuits. Collectively, the work reviewed here shows that activating spinal interneurons can have a powerful impact on spinal respiratory motor output, and can even drive rhythmic bursting in respiratory motoneuron pools under certain conditions. We propose that the primary functions of spinal respiratory neurons include 1) shaping the respiratory pattern into the final efferent motor output from the spinal respiratory nerves; 2) coordinating respiratory muscle activation across the spinal neuraxis; 3) coordinating postural, locomotor and respiratory movements, and 4) enabling plasticity of respiratory motor output in health and disease.

AB Two dimensional (2D) peak finding is a common practice in data analysis for physics experiments, which is typically achieved by computing the local derivatives. However, this method is inherently unstable when the local landscape is complicated or the signal-to-noise ratio of the data is low. In this work, we propose a new method in which the peak tracking task is formalized as an inverse problem, which thus can be solved with a convolutional neural network (CNN). In addition, we show that the underlying physics principle of the experiments can be used to generate the training data. By generalizing the trained neural network on real experimental data, we show that the CNN method can achieve comparable or better results than traditional derivative based methods. This approach can be further generalized in different physics experiments when the physical process is known. (C) 2020 Author(s).

AB Numerous studies have demonstrated anatomical and functional neuroplasticity following spinal cord injury. One of the more notable examples is return of ipsilateral phrenic motoneuron and diaphragm activity which can be induced under terminal neurophysiological conditions after high cervical hemisection in the rat. More recently it has been shown that a protracted, spontaneous recovery also occurs in this model. While a candidate neural substrate has been identified for the former, the neuroanatomical basis underlying spontaneous recovery has not been explored. Demonstrations of spinal respiratory interneurons in other species suggest such cells may play a role; however, the presence of interneurons in the adult rat phrenic circuit - the primary animal model of respiratory plasticity - has not been extensively investigated. Emerging neuroanatomical and electrophysiological results raise the possibility of a more complex neural network underlying spontaneous recovery of phrenic function and compensatory respiratory neuroplasticity after C2 hemisection than has been previously considered.

AB Background: The role of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA) for glenohumeral osteoarthritis (GHOA) with an intact rotator cuff remains unclear with prior investigations demonstrating similar patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) to anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (aTSA). However, legacy PROMs are subject to skewed distributions with many patients achieving the maximum possible score (ceiling scores). We evaluated a cohort of primary rTSAs performed for GHOA with an intact rotator cuff compared with a case-matched cohort of aTSAs using the Shoulder Arthroplasty Smart (SAS) score, a machine learning-derived outcome measure that elim-inates the ceiling effect.Methods: A retrospective review of an international shoulder arthroplasty database was performed between 2001 and 2020. Patients undergoing rTSA for rotator cuff intact GHOA (n = 367) were matched 1:1 with aTSA controls (n = 367) with a minimum of 2-year follow-up. Assessed variables included patient demographics, range of motion, American Shoulder Elbow Surgeons score (ASES), Constant score, Simple Shoulder Test (SST), and the SAS score. Results: Preoperatively, the SAS (49.0 vs. 45.2; P <.001), SST (4.7 vs. 4.1; P=.002), and Constant score (42.5 + 15.3 vs. 38.1 + 14.2; P < .001) were greater in aTSA vs. rTSA. Similarly, the SAS score (82.3 vs. 77.6; P < .001) and SST score (10.8 vs. 10.3; P = .003) remained greater in aTSA postoperatively. In contrast, no differences in the ASES (P = .103) or Constant scores (P = .108) were found between aTSA and rTSA patients postoperatively. Improvement preoperatively to postoperatively did not differ between aTSA and rTSA patients when assessed using the SAS (P = .257), ASES (P = .888), or SST scores (P = .510). However, a higher rate of improve-ment in the Constant score (35.0 vs. 31.8; P = .022) was observed in rTSA compared with aTSA. Higher rates of complications (5.4% vs. 1.6%; P = .008) and revision surgery (4.1% vs. 0.5%; P = .002) were observed in aTSA compared with rTSA.Conclusions: Patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty for rotator cuff intact GHOA experienced higher rates of complications and revisions in aTSA compared with rTSA, but similar levels of clinical improvement between implants when evaluated using a validated outcome score without a ceiling effect. Unlike the ASES and SST scores that are limited by ceiling effects, a higher mean postoperative SAS score after aTSA was observed, but preoperative to postoperative SAS differences were similar after rTSA.Level of evidence: Level III; Retrospective Cohort Comparison; Treatment Study (c) 2023 Published Elsevier Inc. on behalf of Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Board of Trustees.

AB As-built Building Information Models (BIM) are increasingly used to facilitate the management of all aspects of built infrastructure's life cycle. Existing studies mainly focus on automating as-built BIM development for surface elements but often ignore embedded elements such as rebar due to the inaccessibility with typical sensing devices, such as image-based or time-of-flight-based methods. To tackle the issue, this research utilizes Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) together with the photogrammetry method to generate BIMs for in- service buildings considering both surface elements (e.g., column, slab, wall, etc.) and rebar. As the first step, as-built BIM for surface elements is generated and then existing rebar is identified by using GPR. A calibration label is designed and attached to elements which are scanned by GPR device, and a series of images are captured from those elements and then used with other images to generate point clouds. Faster RCNN is then utilized to recognize labels among all images. Next, an inverse photogrammetry approach is deployed to identify the scanned elements in BIM. By matching the recorded timestamps of GPR data and labeled images, links between the rebar in GPR data and elements in BIMs are successfully established. Finally, IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) is developed to generate as-built BIM models. Six case studies demonstrate that the system is capable of automatically developing as-built BIM, while embedded rebar could be efficiently localized and projected into corresponding elements in BIM.

AB In this manuscript, we design, describe, and present a functional model of Time-ofFlight (ToF) cameras. The model can be used to generate randomized scenes that incorporate depth scenarios with various objects at various depths with varied orientations and illumination intensity. In addition to the potential to generate any random depth scenario, the camera, pixels, and binning are modelled incorporating radial distortion based on camera intrinsic and extrinsic. The model also includes ToF artifacts such as Signal Noise, Crosstalk and Multipath. We measured experimentally the Noise in Time-of-Flight. We experimentally fitted, and simulated with state-of-the art Simulator the Crosstalk effect, and characterized multipath according with the existing literature. Our work can be used to generate as many images as needed for neural network (NN) training and testing. The proposed approach can also be used to benchmark and evaluate both End-to-End ToF algorithms as well as specialized algorithms for denoising, unwrapping, crosstalk, and multipath correction.

AB Motivated by an open problem of validating protein identities in label-free shotgun proteomics work-flows, we present a testing procedure to validate class (protein) labels using available measurements across N instances (peptides). More generally, we present a non-parametric solution to the problem of identifying instances that are deemed as outliers relative to the subset of instances assigned to the same class. The primary assumption is that measured distances between instances within the same class are stochastically smaller than measured distances between instances from different classes. We show that the overall type I error probability across all instances within a class can be controlled by some fixed value (say alpha). We also demonstrate conditions where similar results on type II error probability hold. The theoretical results are supplemented by an extensive numerical study illustrating the applicability and viability of our method. Even with up to 25% of instances initially mislabeled, our testing procedure maintains a high specificity and greatly reduces the proportion of mislabeled instances. The applicability and effectiveness of our testing procedure is further illustrated by a detailed example on a proteomics data set from children with sickle cell disease where five spike-in proteins acted as contrasting controls.

AB Much of the current data on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are derived from biopsy-based studies that may introduce ascertainment and selection bias. Selection of patients for liver biopsy has implications for clinical practice and the reported epidemiology of NAFLD. The aim of this study was to determine patient factors predictive of histologic versus empiric clinical diagnosis of NAFLD in real-world practice. Adults from TARGET-NASH were included in this study. Descriptive statistics are provided for the cohort and compare the characteristics of histologic NAFLD versus patients with clinically diagnosed NAFLD, followed by logistic regression and machine-learning models to describe predictors of liver biopsy. The records of 3,474 subjects were analyzed; median age was 59 years, 59% were female, 75% were White, and median body mass index was 32 kg/m(2). Using histologic and/or clinical criteria, a diagnosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis was made in 37%, and cirrhosis in 33%. Comorbid conditions included cardiovascular disease (19%), mental health diagnoses (49%), and osteoarthritis (10%). Predictors of a biopsy diagnosis included White race, female sex, diabetes, and elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT). ALT increased the odds of liver biopsy by 14% per 10-point rise. Machine-learning analyses showed non-White patients with ALT Conclusions: In this real-world cohort of patients with NAFLD, two-thirds of patients did not have a liver biopsy. These patients were more likely to be non-White, older, with a normal ALT, showing potential gaps in or knowledge about this population.

   processing; transformers
ID ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS
AB Background: Semantic textual similarity (STS) is one of the fundamental tasks in natural language processing (NLP). Many shared tasks and corpora for STS have been organized and curated in the general English domain; however, such resources are limited in the biomedical domain. In 2019, the National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2) challenge developed a comprehensive clinical STS dataset and organized a community effort to solicit state-of-the-art solutions for clinical STS.
   Objective: This study presents our transformer-based clinical STS models developed during this challenge as well as new models we explored after the challenge. This project is part of the 2019 n2c2/Open Health NLP shared task on clinical STS.
   Methods: In this study, we explored 3 transformer-based models for clinical STS: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), XLNet, and Robustly optimized BERT approach (RoBERTa). We examined transformer models pretrained using both general English text and clinical text. We also explored using a general English STS dataset as a supplementary corpus in addition to the clinical training set developed in this challenge. Furthermore, we investigated various ensemble methods to combine different transformer models.
   Results: Our best submission based on the XLNet model achieved the third-best performance (Pearson correlation of 0.8864) in this challenge. After the challenge, we further explored other transformer models and improved the performance to 0.9065 using a RoBERTa model, which outperformed the best-performing system developed in this challenge (Pearson correlation of 0.9010).
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated the efficiency of utilizing transformer-based models to measure semantic similarity for clinical text. Our models can be applied to clinical applications such as clinical text deduplication and summarization.

AB Recent neuroimaging studies have shown that the visual cortex plays an important role in representing the affective significance of visual input. The origin of these affect-specific visual representations is debated: they are intrinsic to the visual system versus they arise through reentry from frontal emotion processing structures such as the amygdala. We examined this problem by combining convolutional neural network (CNN) models of the human ventral visual cortex pre-trained on ImageNet with two datasets of affective images. Our results show that in all layers of the CNN models, there were artificial neurons that responded consistently and selectively to neutral, pleasant, or unpleasant images and lesioning these neurons by setting their output to zero or enhancing these neurons by increasing their gain led to decreased or increased emotion recognition performance respectively. These results support the idea that the visual system may have the intrinsic ability to represent the affective significance of visual input and suggest that CNNs offer a fruitful platform for testing neuroscientific theories.
   What is the role played by sensory cortices in assessing the emotional significance of sensory input? This question is attracting increasing research interest. Recent work has found affect-specific neural representations in visual cortex. The origins of these representations are debated. According to the reentry hypothesis, these representations result from reentrant feedback arising from anterior emotion processing structures such as the amygdala. An alternative hypothesis holds that sensory cortex may have the intrinsic capacity to represent the emotional qualities of sensory input. We examined this problem by utilizing the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained to recognized visual objects as computational models of the primate ventral visual system. Emotionally charged images were divided into three broad categories (pleasant, neutral and unpleasant) and presented to the CNNs. Responses of artificial neurons to these images were found to exhibit robust emotion selectivity. Importantly, enhancing the neurons that were selective for a given emotion led to the increased ability in recognizing that emotion, whereas lesioning these neurons led to the decrease in that ability. This research lends support to the notion that emotional perception might be an intrinsic property of the visual cortex. It also underscores the CNNs' value in examining neuroscientific theories.

AB In a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, a novel connectivity analysis method termed within-condition interregional covariance analysis (WICA) was introduced for investigation into brain modulation during tongue movement and reading Chinese pinyins and logographic characters. We found that performing a horizontal tongue movement task generated a specific brain module with hierarchical orders of neural computation. Such functional modularity was further examined during both overt and silent Chinese reading tasks. Our results showed that overt pinyin reading was associated with the following distributed regions involved in tongue movement: the primary motor cortex (M1), the supplementary motor area (SMA), Broca's area, and Wernicke's area. Furthermore, we have used the WICA and demonstrated task-dependent covariance patterns that are strongly associated with the M1 mouth/tongue region, in which the Broca-Wernicke pathway is implicated in a meaning access procedure based on assembled phonology, while the SMA-Broca pathway is implicated in a meaning access procedure based on addressed phonology. Our functional connectivity analysis of the neural pathway involved in language processing may provide a basis for future studies of the dynamic neural network associated with language learning and reading in both developmental and disease conditions.

AB At road intersections, vehicles frequently stop with idling engines during the red-light period and speed up rapidly in the green-light period, which generates higher velocity fluctuation and thus higher emission rates. Additionally, the frequent changes of wind direction further add the highly variable dispersion of pollutants at the street scale. It is, therefore, very difficult to estimate the distribution of pollutant concentrations using conventional deterministic causal models.
   For this reason, a hybrid model combining wavelet neural network and genetic algorithm (GA-WNN) is proposed for predicting 5-min series of carbon monoxide (CO) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations in proximity to an intersection. The proposed model is examined based on the measured data under two situations. As the measured pollutant concentrations are found to be dependent on the distance to the intersection, the model is evaluated in three locations respectively, i.e. 110 m, 330 m and 500 m. Due to the different variation of pollutant concentrations on varied time, the model is also evaluated in peak and off-peak traffic time periods separately. Additionally, the proposed model, together with the back-propagation neural network (BPNN), is examined with the measured data in these situations. The proposed model is found to perform better in predictability and precision for both CO and PM2.5 than BPNN does, implying that the hybrid model can be an effective tool to improve the accuracy of estimating pollutants' distribution pattern at intersections. The outputs of these findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed model to be applicable to forecast the distribution pattern of air pollution in real-time in proximity to road intersection.

The agents have heterogeneous dynamics modeled by uncertain, nonlinear Euler-Lagrange equations of motion affected by heterogeneous, unknown, exogenous disturbances. The developed controller requires only one-hop (delayed) communication from network neighbors and the communication delays are assumed to be heterogeneous, uncertain, and time-varying. Each agent uses an estimate of communication delay to provide feedback of estimated recent tracking error. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the improved performance of the developed controller over other popular control designs.

TI Inferring the direction of rhythmic neural transmission via

AB Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) estimates the statistical dependence between the phase of a low-frequency component and the amplitude of a high-frequency component of local field potentials (LFP). To date PAC has been mainly applied to one signal. In this work, we introduce a new application of PAC to two LFPs and suggest that it can be used to infer the direction and strength of rhythmic neural transmission between distinct brain networks. This hypothesis is based on the accumulating evidence that transmembrane currents related to action potentials contribute a broad-band component to LFP in the high-gamma band, and PAC calculated between the amplitude of high-gamma (>60 Hz) in one LFP and the phase of a low-frequency oscillation (e.g., theta) in another would therefore relate the output (spiking) of one area to the input (somatic/dendritic postsynaptic potentials) of the other. We tested the hypothesis on theta-band long range communications between hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) and theta-band short range communications between dentate gyrus (DG) and the Ammon's horn (CA1) within the hippocampus. The ground truth was provided by the known anatomical connections predicting hippocampus -> PFC and DG -> CA1, i.e., theta transmission is unidirectional in both cases: from hippocampus to PFC and from DG to CA1 along the tri-synaptic pathway within hippocampus. We found that (1) hippocampal high-gamma amplitude was significantly coupled to PFC theta phase, but not vice versa; (2) similarly, DG high-gamma amplitude was significantly coupled to CAltheta phase, but not vice versa, and (3) the DG high-gamma-CAl theta PAC was significantly correlated with DG -CA1Granger causality, a well-established analytical measure of directional neural transmission. These results support the hypothesis that inter-regional PAC (ir-PAC) can be used to relate the output of a rhythmic "driver" network (i.e., high gamma) to the input of a rhythmic "receiver" network (i.e., theta) and thereby establish the direction and strength of rhythmic neural transmission.

AB Airway protection is a critically important function that prevents/limits the intrusion of foreign material into the pulmonary tree. A host of different behaviors participate in this process. The control, coordination, and execution of these behaviors is a complex process that has recently received increased attention. Data from human clinical and animal studies support the concept of a coordinated neural control system that governs the appropriate expression and sequencing of airway protective behaviors. Our current knowledge of the proposed neural control network for breathing, cough, swallow and other airway protective behaviors indicates that it is a highly complex system that can 'rewire' (reconfigure) itself to perform several different functions. Computational modeling and simulation have been used as tools to investigate this system. The results of modeling efforts have yielded motor output patterns of upper airway and respiratory muscles that are very similar to those recorded in vivo. Regulation and coordination of multiple different airway protective behaviors have been successfully simulated. Outcomes of simulation efforts support the hypothesis that computational modeling of airway protection can yield important testable hypotheses regarding brainstem neural network functions and organization. Modeling of complex systems can be challenging but the open availability of straight-forward computational tools is likely to result in increased implementation of modeling and simulation as adjuncts to traditional methods of investigation of the control of the upper airway.

AB HistoLens is an open-source graphical user interface developed using MATLAB AppDesigner for visual and quantitative analysis of histological datasets. HistoLens enables users to interrogate sets of digitally annotated whole slide images to efficiently characterize histological differences between disease and experimental groups. Users can dynamically visualize the distribution of 448 hand-engineered features quantifying color, texture, morphology, and distribution across microanatomic sub-compartments. Additionally, users can map differentially detected image features within the images by highlighting affected regions. We demonstrate the utility of HistoLens to identify hand-engineered features that correlate with pathognomonic renal glomerular characteristics distinguishing diabetic nephropathy and amyloid nephropathy from the histologically unremarkable glomeruli in minimal change disease. Additionally, we examine the use of HistoLens for glomerular feature discovery in the Tg26 mouse model of HIV-associated nephropathy. We identify numerous quantitative glomerular features distinguishing Tg26 transgenic mice from wild-type mice, corresponding to a progressive renal disease phenotype. Thus, we demonstrate an off-the-shelf and ready-to-use toolkit for quantitative renal pathology applications.

AB This paper aims at solving online equality-constrained quadratic programming problem, which is widely encountered in science and engineering, e.g., computer vision and pattern recognition, digital signal processing, and robotics. Recurrent neural networks such as conventional GradientNet and ZhangNet are considered as powerful solvers for such a problem in light of its high computational efficiency and capability of circuit realisation. In this paper, an improved primal recurrent neural network and its electronic implementation are proposed and analysed. Compared to the existing recurrent networks, i.e. GradientNet and ZhangNet, our network can theoretically guarantee superior global exponential convergence. Robustness performance of our such neural model is also analysed under a large model implementation error, with the upper bound of stead-state solution error estimated. Simulation results demonstrate theoretical analysis on the proposed model, which also verify the effectiveness of the proposed model for online equality-constrained quadratic programming.

AB Machine learning approaches have been increasingly utilized in the field of medicine. Brucellosis is one of the most common contagious zoonotic diseases with significant impacts on livestock health, reproduction, production, and public health worldwide. Therefore, our objective was to determine the seroprevalence and compare the logistic regression and Classification and Regression Tree (CART) data-mining analysis to assess risk factors associated with Brucella infection in the densest cattle populated Egyptian governorates. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 400 animals (383 cows, 17 bulls) distributed over four Governorates in Egypt's Nile Delta in 2019. The randomly selected animals from studied geographical areas were serologically tested for Brucella using iELISA, and the animals' information was obtained from the farm records or animal owners. Eight supposed risk factors (geographic location, gender, herd size, age, history of abortion, shared equipment, and disinfection post calving) were evaluated using multiple stepwise logistic regression and CART machine-learning techniques. A total of 84 (21.0%; 95% CI 17.1-25.3) serum samples were serologically positive for Brucella. The highest seroprevalence of Brucella infection was reported among animals raised in herd size > 100 animals (65.5%), with no disinfection post-calving (61.7%), with a history of abortion (59.6%), and with shared equipment without thorough cleaning and disinfection (57.1%). The multiple stepwise logistic regression modeling identified herd size, history of abortion, and disinfection post-calving as important risk factors. However, CART modeling identified herd size, disinfection post-calving, history of abortion, and shared equipment as the most potential risk factors for Brucella infection. Comparing the two models, CART model showed a higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC = 0.98; 95% CI 0.95 - 1.00) than the binary logistic regression (AUROC = 0.89; 95% CI 0.73 - 0.92). Our findings strongly imply that Brucella infection is most likely to spread among animals raised in large herds (> 100 animals) with a history of abortions and bad hygienic measures post calving. The CART data-mining modeling provides an accurate technique to identify risk factors of Brucella infection in cattle.

AB Modularity and resilience are fundamental properties of brain network organization and function. The interplay of these network characteristics is integral to understanding brain vulnerability, network efficiency, and neurocognitive disorders. One potential methodology to explore brain network modularity and resilience is through percolation theory, a sub-branch of graph theory that simulates lesions across brain networks. In this work, percolation theory is applied to connectivity matrices derived from functional MRI from human, mice, and null networks. Nodes, or regions, with the highest betweenness centrality, a graph theory quantifier that examines shortest paths, were sequentially removed from the network. This attack methodology led to a rapid fracturing of the network, resulting in two terminal modules connected by one transfer module. Additionally, preceding the rapid network fracturing, the average betweenness centrality of the network peaked in value, indicating a critical point in brain network functionality. Thus, this work introduces a methodological perspective to identify hubs within the brain based on critical points that can be used as an architectural framework for a neural network. By applying percolation theory to functional brain networks through a network phase-transition lens, network sub-modules are identified using local spikes in betweenness centrality as an indicator of brain criticality. This modularity phase transition provides supporting evidence of the brain functioning at a near-critical point while showcasing a formalism to understand the computational efficiency of the brain as a neural network.

AB Significant technological advances made in recent years have shepherded a dramatic increase in utilization of digital technologies for biomedicine- everything from the widespread use of electronic health records to improved medical imaging capabilities and the rising ubiquity of genomic sequencing contribute to a "digitization" of biomedical research and clinical care. With this shift toward computerized tools comes a dramatic increase in the amount of available data, and current tools for data analysis capable of extracting meaningful knowledge from this wealth of information have yet to catch up. This article seeks to provide an overview of emerging mathematical methods with the potential to improve the abilities of clinicians and researchers to analyze biomedical data, but may be hindered from doing so by a lack of conceptual accessibility and awareness in the life sciences research community. In particular, we focus on topological data analysis (TDA), a set of methods grounded in the mathematical field of algebraic topology that seeks to describe and harness features related to the "shape" of data. We aim to make such techniques more approachable to non-mathematicians by providing a conceptual discussion of their theoretical foundations followed by a survey of their published applications to scientific research. Finally, we discuss the limitations of these methods and suggest potential avenues for future work integrating mathematical tools into clinical care and biomedical informatics.

AB This paper extends the previous LandSys I to introduce artificial neural networks (ANNs into the framework of cellular automata (CA), multiagents, and geographic information system (GIS) to forecast land-use change at the grid cell level (50 x 50 m). In the model, the temporal and spatial interactions of land-use change are described by CA where transition rules are defined by ANNs to reduce the tedious work of parameter calibration in LandSys I. Compared with LandSys I, an improved multiagent model in LandSys II captures both zoning policies and human decision-making behaviors. The effect of multiple human decision-making behaviors (e.g., governments, households, developers) on land-use change has been quantified. Based on the historical GIS data for Orange County, Florida, the model has a higher predictive ability (87.7%, compared to 85.7% in LandSys I) for land-use change from Year 1990 to 2000. It is also found that either increasing hidden layers in ANNs or the use of multiagent models improves prediction accuracy. A comparison between LandSys I and II indicates that both models are viable; however, LandSys II is freely transferable and is more suitable for land-use forecasting, whereas LandSys I is more appropriate for evaluating the interconnections between land use and its affecting variables.

AB The geographic expansion of mosquitos is associated with a rising frequency of outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases (MBD) worldwide. We collected occurrence locations and times of mosquito species, mosquito-borne arboviruses, and MBDs in the mainland of China in 1954-2020. We mapped the spatial distributions of mosquitoes and arboviruses at the county level, and we used machine learning algorithms to assess contributions of ecoclimatic, socioenvironmental, and biological factors to the spatial distributions of 26 predominant mosquito species and two MBDs associated with high disease burden. Altogether, 339 mosquito species and 35 arboviruses were mapped at the county level. Culex tritaeniorhynchus is found to harbor the highest variety of arboviruses (19 species), followed by Anopheles sinensis (11) and Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus (9). Temperature seasonality, annual precipitation, and mammalian richness were the three most important contributors to the spatial distributions of most of the 26 predominant mosquito species. The model-predicted suitable habitats are 60-664% larger in size than what have been observed, indicating the possibility of severe under-detection. The spatial distribution of major mosquito species in China is likely to be under-estimated by current field observations. More active surveillance is needed to investigate the mosquito species in specific areas where investigation is missing but model-predicted probability is high.

AB Submucosal invasion depth is a significant prognostic factor when assessing lymph node metastasis and cancer itself to plan proper treatment for the patient. Conventionally, oncologists measure the invasion depth by hand which is a laborious, subjective, and time-consuming process. The manual pathological examination by measuring accurate carcinoma cell invasion with considerable inter-observer and intra-observer variations is still challenging. The increasing use of medical imaging and artificial intelligence reveals a significant role in clinical medicine and pathology. In this paper, we propose an approach to study invasive behavior and measure the invasion depth of carcinoma from stained histopathology images. Specifically, our model includes adaptive stain normalization, color decomposition, and morphological reconstruction with adaptive thresholding to separate the epithelium with blue ratio image. Our method splits the image into multiple non-overlapping meaningful segments and successfully finds the homogeneous segments to measure accurate invasion depth. The invasion depths are measured from the inner epithelium edge to outermost pixels of the deepest part of particles in image. We conduct our experiments on skin melanoma tissue samples as well as on organotypic invasion model utilizing myoma tissue and oral squamous cell carcinoma. The performance is experimentally compared to three closely related reference methods and our method provides a superior result in measuring invasion depth. This computational technique will be beneficial for the segmentation of epithelium and other particles for the development of novel computer-aided diagnostic tools in biobank applications.

AB We analyze the determinants of adoption of distributed solar photovoltaic systems, focusing on small and medium-sized commercial and service firms. We use monthly billing data that are perfectly matched with data from a novel survey that gathers information on electricity consumption, stock of electric equipment, and a rich set of firm characteristics in the Metropolitan Area of Aguascalientes, Mexico. Using an econometric model, we find evidence that a set of explanatory variables such as business characteristics, the economic sector, ownership status, stock and usage of equipment and appliances, presence of other solar technologies, and views about the use of renewable energy are important determinants of the probability of adoption of solar panel systems. Furthermore, using machine learning methods to identify the best predictors of solar adoption, we indirectly validate the theory-driven empirical model by assessing a large set of explanatory variables and selecting a subset of these variables. In addition, we investigate relevant cases where a priori solar panel adoption seems to be cost-effective but structural adoption barriers and adoption gaps might coexist for certain groups of electricity users. We also calculate the social cost savings and the avoided CO2 emissions. Finally, based on our results, we provide several policy implications and recommendations.

AB An attitude tracking controller is developed for control moment gyroscope (CMG)-actuated satellites, which is shown to achieve accurate attitude tracking in the presence of unmodeled external disturbance torques, parametric uncertainty, and nonlinear CMG disturbances. Since the disturbances/uncertainties do not all satisfy the typical linear-in-the-parameters (LP) assumption, a neural network (NN) is included in the control development. The innovation of the result is the development of a Lyapunov-based design/analysis that indicates exponential convergence to an arbitrarily small domain. The result is obtained despite the characteristics of the uncertainty; the nonvanishing disturbance terms; and the fact that the control input is premultiplied by a non-square, time-varying, nonlinear, uncertain matrix. In addition to the Lyapunov-based analysis, experimental results demonstrate the performance of the developed controller. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB The environmental changes in the Caatinga biome have already resulted in it reaching levels of approximately 50% of its original vegetation, making it the third most degraded biome in Brazil, due to inadequate grazing practices that are driven by the difficulty of monitoring and estimating the yield parameters of forage plants, especially in agroforestry systems (AFS) in this biome. This study aimed to compare the predictive ability of different indexes with regard to the biomass and leaf area index of forage crops (bushveld signal grass and buffel grass) in AFS in the Caatinga biome and to evaluate the influence of removing system components on model performance. The normalized green red difference index (NGRDI) and the visible atmospherically resistant index (VARI) showed higher correlations (p < 0.05) with the variables. In addition, removing trees from the orthomosaics was the approach that most favored the correlation values. The models based on classification and regression trees (CARTs) showed lower RMSE values, presenting values of 3020.86, 1201.75, and 0.20 for FB, DB, and LAI, respectively, as well as higher CCC values (0.94). Using NGRDI and VARI, removing trees from the images, and using CART are recommended in estimating biomass and leaf area index in agroforestry systems in the Caatinga biome.

AB Mental imagery is a fundamental cognitive process of interest to basic scientists and clinical researchers. This study examined large-scale oscillatory brain activity in the alpha band (8-12 Hz) during language-driven mental imagery using dense-array EEG. Three experiments demonstrated relative increases in alpha amplitude: (1) during imagery prompted by words compared to fixation without imagery instruction, (2) during imagery of word content compared to imagery of geometric shapes, and (3) during imagery of emotionally evocative words compared to imagery of less emotionally arousing content. Alpha increases for semantically loaded imagery were observed in parieto-occipital regions, sustained throughout the imagery period. Findings imply that alpha oscillations index active memory and internal cognitive processing, reflecting neural communication in cortical networks representing motor, semantic, and perceptual aspects of the imagined scene.

AB A variety of metaheuristic approaches have emerged in recent years for solving the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP), a well-known NP-hard problem in scheduling. In this paper, we propose a Neurogenetic approach which is a hybrid of genetic algorithms (GA) and neural-network (NN) approaches. In this hybrid approach the search process relies on GA iterations for global search and on NN iterations for local search. The GA and NN search iterations are interleaved in a manner that allows NN to pick the best solution thus far from the GA pool and perform an intensification search in the solution's local neighborhood. Similarly, good solutions obtained by NN search are included in the GA population for further search using the GA iterations. Although both GA and NN approaches, independently give good solutions, we found that the hybrid approach gives better solutions than either approach independently for the same number of shared iterations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach empirically on the standard benchmark problems of size J30, J60, J90 and J120 from PSPLIB. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Multielectrode neurophysiological recording and high-resolution neuroimaging generate multivariate data that are the basis for understanding the patterns of neural interactions. How to extract directions of information flow in brain networks from these data remains a key challenge. Research over the last few years has identified Granger causality as a statistically principled technique to furnish this capability. The estimation of Granger causality currently requires autoregressive modeling of neural data. Here, we propose a nonparametric approach based on widely used Fourier and wavelet transforms to estimate both pairwise and conditional measures of Granger causality, eliminating the need of explicit autoregressive data modeling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by applying it to synthetic data generated by network models with known connectivity and to local field potentials recorded from monkeys performing a sensorimotor task.

AB Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) may be impaired at expressing emotional faces and perceiving emotional facial affect. We tested the hypothesis that patients with PD may be impaired at imaging emotional faces. We first compared 12 patients with PD and 30 control subjects on perceptual and imagery tasks. Patients were significantly impaired on a task of emotional facial imagery but not on a control task of object imagery. Patients were also impaired on a task of perceiving emotional faces. Subsequently, we found that PD patients were impaired relative to controls on making emotional faces. Performance on both the perceptual and motor tasks of facial expression significantly correlated with performance on the emotional facial imagery task. We suggest that the basal ganglia, together with the right hemisphere, are part of a neural network subserving emotional facial tasks,

AB Limit cycle oscillations (LCOs) affect current fighter aircraft and are expected to be present on next generation fighter aircraft. Current efforts in control systems designed to suppress LCO behavior have either used a linear model, restricting the flight regime, require exact knowledge of the system dynamics, or require uncertainties in the system dynamics to be linear-in-the-parameters and only present in the torsional stiffness. Furthermore, the aerodynamic model used in prior research efforts neglects nonlinear effects. This paper presents the development of a controller consisting of a continuous robust integral of the sign of the error (RISE) feedback term with a neural network (NN) feedforward term to achieve asymptotic tracking of uncertainties that do not satisfy the linear-in-the-parameters assumption. Simulation results are presented to validate the performance of the developed controller.

AB Designing materials for a targeted mechanical property is a complex problem due to its structure and property relationship nature, traditionally relying on experimental methods. Computational approaches offer a promising alternative, but they are often computationally intensive. This limits their applicability for solving the goal-based structure design problem. This study focuses on the design of microstructure to achieve specific mechanical properties by combining generative adversarial networks, deep neural networks, and genetic algorithm optimization techniques. In this work to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach we select a widely used pearlitic steel lamella microstructure where the phase fraction of ferrite and cementite and the lamella distribution significantly influence the strength and ductility. A method for designing the pearlite microstructure features for the targeted mechanical properties, such as yield strength (sigma y), ultimate strength (sigma ut), and fracture strain (epsilon f) is developed by applying inverse microstructure design techniques to achieve the targeted mechanical properties, specifically in fully pearlitic steel materials. The findings hold great promise, particularly when coupled with additive manufacturing, in offering an efficient and versatile framework for structural materials design for targeted material applications.

AB Rapid, robust computation of effective connectivity between neural regions is an important next step in characterizing the brain's organization, particularly in the resting state. However, recent work has called into question the value of causal inference computed directly from BOLD, demonstrating that valid inferences require transformation of the BOLD signal into its underlying neural events as necessary for accurate causal inference. In this work we develop an approach for effective connectivity estimation directly from deconvolution-based features and estimates of inter-regional communication lag. We then test, in both simulation as well as whole-brain fMRI BOLD signal, the viability of this approach. Our results show that deconvolution precision and network size play outsized roles in effective connectivity estimation performance. Idealized simulation conditions allow for statistically significant effective connectivity estimation of networks of up to four hundred regions-of-interest (ROIs). Under simulation of realistic recording conditions and deconvolution performance, however, our result indicates that effective connectivity is viable in networks containing up to approximately sixty ROIs. We then validated the ability for the proposed method to reliably detect effective connectivity in whole-brain fMRI signal parcellated into networks of viable size. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

DE Global attention; image captioning; latent contribution
AB In this paper, we develop a novel global-attention-based neural network (GANN) for vision language intelligence, specifically, image captioning (language description of a given image). As many previous works, the encoder-decoder framework is adopted in our proposed model, in which the encoder is responsible for encoding the region proposal features and extracting global caption feature based on a specially designed module of predicting the caption objects, and the decoder generates captions by taking the obtained global caption feature along with the encoded visual features as inputs for each attention head of the decoder layer. The global caption feature is introduced for the purpose of exploring the latent contributions of region proposals for image captioning, and further helping the decoder better focus on the most relevant proposals so as to extract more accurate visual feature in each time step of caption generation. Our GANN is implemented by incorporating the global caption feature into the attention weight calculation phase in the word predication process in each head of the decoder layer. In our experiments, we qualitatively analyzed the proposed model, and quantitatively evaluated several state-of-the-art schemes with GANN on the MS-COCO dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed global attention mechanism for image captioning.

TI Novel Applications of Technology for Advancing Tidal Marsh Ecology

DE Animal tracking; Biotracers; Imagery; Machine learning; Open science
AB Over the last 20 years, innovations have led to the development of exciting new technologies and novel applications of established technologies, collectively increasing the scale, scope, and quality of research possible in tidal marsh systems. Thus, ecological research on marshes is being revolutionized, in the same way as ecological research more generally, by the availability of new tools and analytical techniques. This perspective highlights current and potential applications of novel research technologies for marsh ecology. These are summarized under several themes: (1.) imagery - sophisticated imaging sensors mounted on satellites, drones, and underwater vehicles; (2.) animal tracking - acoustic telemetry, passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags, and satellite tracking, and (3.) biotracers - investigation of energy pathways and food web structure using chemical tracers such as compound-specific stable isotopes, isotope addition experiments, contaminant analysis, and eDNA. While the adoption of these technological advances has greatly enhanced our ability to examine contemporary questions in tidal marsh ecology, these applications also create significant challenges with the accessibility, processing, and synthesis of the large amounts of data generated. Implementation of open science practices has allowed for greater access to data. Newly available machine learning algorithms have been widely applied to resolve the challenge of detecting patterns in massive environmental datasets. The potential integration on digital platforms of multiple, large data streams measuring physical and biological components of tidal marsh ecosystems is an opportunity to advance science support for management responses needed in a rapidly changing coastal landscape.

AB The dairy industry faces significant challenges in data integration and analysis, which are critical for informed decision-making, operational optimization, and sustainability. Data integration-combining data from diverse sources, such as herd management systems, sensors, and diagnostics-remains difficult due to the lack of standardization, infrastructure barriers, and proprietary concerns. This commentary explores these issues based on insights from a multidisciplinary group of stakeholders, including industry experts, researchers, and practitioners. Key challenges discussed include the absence of a national animal identification system in the US, high IT resource costs, reluctance to share data due to competitive disadvantages, and differences in global data handling practices. Proposed pathways forward include developing comprehensive data integration guidelines, enhancing farmer awareness through training programs, and fostering collaboration across industry, academia, and technology providers. Additional recommendations involve improving data exchange standards, addressing interoperability issues, and leveraging advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence and cloud computing. Emphasis is placed on localized data integration solutions for farm-level benefits and broader research applications to advance sustainability, traceability, and profitability within the dairy supply chain. These outcomes provide a foundation for achieving streamlined data systems, enabling actionable insights, and fostering innovation in the dairy industry.

AB Blocking the binding of the envelope HIV-1 protein to immune cells is a popular concept for development of anti-HIV therapeutics. R5 HIV-1 binds CCR5, X4 HIV-1 binds CXCR4, and dual-tropic HIV-1 can bind either coreceptor for cellular entry. R5 viruses are associated with early infection and over time can evolve to X4 viruses that are associated with immune failure. Dual-tropic HIV-1 is less studied; however, it represents functional antigenic intermediates during the transition of R5 to X4 viruses. Viral tropism is linked partly to the HIV-1 envelope V3 domain, where the amino acid sequence helps dictate the receptor a particular virus will target; however, using V3 sequence information to identify dual-tropic HIV-1 isolates has remained difficult. Our goal in this study was to elucidate features of dual-tropic HIV-1 isolates that assist in the biological understanding of dual-tropism and develop an approach for their detection. Over 1559 HIV-1 subtype B sequences with known tropisms were analyzed. Each sequence was represented by 73 structural, biochemical and regional features. These features were provided to an evolved neural network classifier and evaluated using balanced and unbalanced data sets. The study resolved R5X4 viruses from R5 with an accuracy of 81.8% and from X4 with an accuracy of 78.8%. The approach also identified a set of V3 features (hydrophobicity, structural and polarity) that are associated with tropism transitions. The ability to distinguish R5X4 isolates will improve computational tropism decisions for RS vs. X4 and assist in HIV-1 research and drug development efforts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB The decision to mate may be one of the most important decisions that animals make. For monogamous species, this decision can carry the added weight of limiting future mating opportunities. The mechanisms that govern these decisions have presumably been shaped by evolution in ways that optimize decision-making processes. In particular, a so-called social decision-making network (SDM) has been proposed, which integrates brain structures comprising the 'social behavior network' with a neural system associated with reward. Here, we investigate the neural phenotypic differences in the SDM for oxytocin and vasopressin receptors (OTR, V1aR) of female socially monogamous prairie voles living in naturalistic conditions. We focus on these receptors because they are profoundly involved in mammalian social behavior. We found that V1aR in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, medial amygdala and ventral pallidum, and OTR in the nucleus accumbens and hippocampus significantly differed between pregnant and non-pregnant females. Most of these areas are more closely related to the reward component of the SDM. V1aR in the ventral pallidum was also greater in paired than in single females. Finally, reproductive success within mating tactics was related to receptor density in brain structures across the SDM, particularly those serving as the interface between the social behavior network and the reward system. Our data support the hypothesis that neural phenotype for neuromodulatory nonapeptide receptors within the SDM relates to natural behavior associated with reproductive decisions.

AB Background and Aims Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonists decrease hepatic/visceral fat (VF) and improve necroinflammation despite subcutaneous (SC) fat weight-gain. Understanding the impact of changes in VF, VF-to-SC fat distribution (VF/SC) and adiponectin (ADPN) levels in relation to histological improvement after weight-loss or pioglitazone is relevant as novel PPAR-gamma agonists are being developed for treating non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Methods Fifty-five patients with NASH received a -500 kcal/d hypocaloric diet and were randomized (double-blind) to pioglitazone (45 mg/d) or placebo for 6-months. Before and after treatment patients underwent a liver biopsy and measurement of hepatic/peripheral glucose fluxes, hepatic/adipose tissue-IR and, in 35 patients, hepatic and VF/SC-fat was measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy/imaging. Data were examined by multivariable statistical analyses combined with machine-learning techniques (partial least square discriminant analysis [PLS-DA]). Results Both pioglitazone (despite weight-gain) and placebo (if weight-loss) reduced steatosis but only pioglitazone ameliorated necroinflammation. Using machine-learning PLS-DA showed that the treatment differences induced by a PPAR-gamma agonist vs placebo on metabolic variables and liver histology could be best explained by the increase in ADPN and a decrease in VF/SC, and to a lesser degree, improvement in oral glucose tolerance test-glucose concentrations and ALT. Decrease in steatosis and disease activity score (ballooning plus lobular inflammation) kept a close relationship with an increase in ADPN (r = -.71 and r = -.44, P < .007, respectively) and reduction in VF/SC fat (r = .41 and r = .37, P < .03 respectively). Conclusions Reduction in VF and improved VF/SC-distribution, combined with an increase in ADPN, mediate the histological benefits of PPAR-gamma action, highlighting the central role of fat metabolism and its distribution on steatohepatitis disease activity in patients with NASH.

TI Acupuncture modulates temporal neural responses in wide brain networks:

AB Background: Accumulating neuroimaging studies in humans have shown that acupuncture can modulate a widely distributed brain network, large portions of which are overlapped with the pain-related areas. Recently, a striking feature of acupuncture-induced analgesia is found to be associated with its long-last effect, which has a delayed onset and gradually reaches a peak even after acupuncture needling being terminated. Identifying temporal neural responses in these areas that occur at particular time - both acute and sustained effects during acupuncture processes - may therefore shed lights on how such peripheral inputs are conducted and mediated through the CNS. In the present study, we adopted a non-repeated event-related (NRER) fMRI paradigm and control theory based approach namely change-point analysis in order to capture the detailed temporal profile of neural responses induced by acupuncture.
   Results: Our findings demonstrated that neural activities at the different stages of acupuncture presented distinct temporal patterns, in which consistently positive neural responses were found during the period of acupuncture needling while much more complex and dynamic activities found during a post-acupuncture period. These brain responses had a significant time-dependent effect which showed different onset time and duration of neural activities. The amygdala and perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC), exhibited increased activities during the needling phase while decreased gradually to reach a peak below the baseline. The periaqueductal gray (PAG) and hypothalamus presented saliently intermittent activations across the whole fMRI session. Apart from the time-dependent responses, relatively persistent activities were also identified in the anterior insula and prefrontal cortices. The overall findings indicate that acupuncture may engage differential temporal neural responses as a function of time in a wide range of brain networks.
   Conclusions: Our study has provided evidence supporting a view that acupuncture intervention involves complex modulations of temporal neural response, and its effect can gradually resolve as a function of time. The functional specificity of acupuncture at ST36 may involve multiple levels of differential activities of a wide range of brain networks, which are gradually enhanced even after acupuncture needle being terminated.

AB Deformable joint contact models can be used to estimate loading conditions for cartilage-cartilage, implant-implant, human-orthotic, and foot-ground interactions. However, contact evaluations are often so expensive computationally that they can be prohibitive for simulations or optimizations requiring thousands or even millions of contact evaluations. To overcome this limitation, we developed a novel surrogate contact modeling method based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). The method uses special sampling techniques to gather input-output data points from an original (slow) contact model in multiple domains of input space, where each domain represents a different physical situation likely to be encountered. For each contact force and torque output by the original contact model, a multi-layer feed-forward ANN is defined, trained, and incorporated into a surrogate contact model. As an evaluation problem, we created an ANN-based surrogate contact model of an artificial tibiofemoral joint using over 75,000 evaluations of a fine-grid elastic foundation (EF) contact model. The surrogate contact model computed contact forces and torques about 1000 times faster than a less accurate coarse grid EF contact model. Furthermore, the surrogate contact model was seven times more accurate than the coarse grid EF contact model within the input domain of a walking motion. For larger input domains, the surrogate contact model showed the expected trend of increasing error with increasing domain size. In addition, the surrogate contact model was able to identify out-of-contact situations with high accuracy. Computational contact models created using our proposed ANN approach may remove an important computational bottleneck from musculoskeletal simulations or optimizations incorporating deformable joint contact models.

TI Detecting and diagnosing terrestrial gravitational-wave mimics through
   feature learning
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
LA English
DT Article
ID SCATTERED-LIGHT; NOISE
AB As engineered systems grow in complexity, there is an increasing need for automatic methods that can detect, diagnose, and even correct transient anomalies that inevitably arise and can be difficult or impossible to diagnose and fix manually. Among the most sensitive and complex systems of our civilization are the detectors that search for incredibly small variations in distance caused by gravitational waves-phenomena originally predicted by Albert Einstein to emerge and propagate through the universe as the result of collisions between black holes and other massive objects in deep space. The extreme complexity and precision of such detectors causes them to be subject to transient noise issues that can significantly limit their sensitivity and effectiveness. They are also subject to nearly constant development, improvement, commissioning and other invasive actions that change the nature of the data and its artifact contamination. In this work, we present a demonstration of a method that can detect and characterize emergent transient anomalies of such massively complex systems. We illustrate the performance, precision, and adaptability of the automated solution via one of the prevalent issues limiting gravitational-wave discoveries: noise artifacts of terrestrial origin that contaminate gravitational wave observatories' highly sensitive measurements and can obscure or even mimic the faint astrophysical signals for which they are listening. Specifically, we demonstrate how a highly interpretable convolutional classifier can automatically learn to detect transient anomalies from auxiliary detector data without needing to observe the anomalies themselves. We also illustrate several other useful features of the model, including how it performs automatic variable selection to reduce tens of thousands of auxiliary data channels to only a few relevant ones; how it identifies behavioral signatures predictive of anomalies in those channels; and how it can be used to investigate individual anomalies and the channels associated with them. The solution outlined is broadly applicable, enabling automated anomaly discovery and characterization and human-inthe-loop anomaly elimination.

AB Objective: The ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) controls energy and glucose homeostasis through direct connections to a distributed network of nuclei in the hypothalamus, midbrain, and hindbrain. Structural changes in VMH circuit morphology have the potential to alter VMH function throughout life, however, molecular signals responsible for specifying its neural connections are not fully defined. The VMH contains a high density of neurons that express brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a potent neurodevelopmental effector known to regulate neuronal survival, growth, differentiation, and connectivity in a number of neural systems. In the current study, we examined whether BDNF impacts the afferent and efferent connections of the VMH, as well as energy homeostatic function.
   Methods: To determine if BDNF is required for VMH circuit formation, a transgenic mouse model was used to conditionally delete Bdnf from steroidogenic factor 1 (SF1) expressing neurons of the VMH prior to the onset of establishing neural connections with other regions. Projections of SF1 expressing neurons were visualized with a genetically targeted fluorescent label and immunofluorescence was used to measure the density of afferents to SF1 neurons in the absence of BDNF. Physiological changes in body weight and circulating blood glucose were also evaluated in the mutant mice.
   Results: Our findings suggest that BDNF is required to establish normal densities of GABAergic afferents onto SF1 neurons located in the ventrolateral part of the VMH. Furthermore, loss of BDNF from VMH SF1 neurons results in impaired physiological responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia.
   Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that BDNF is required for formation and/or maintenance of inhibitory inputs to SF1 neurons, with enduring effects on glycemic control. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

AB Although, neurosensory systems might have evolved independently in ctenophores, very little is known about their organization and functions. Most ctenophores are pelagic and deep-water species and cannot be bred in the laboratory. Thus, it is not surprising that neuroanatomical data are available for only one genus within the group-Pleurobrachia. Here, using immunohistochemistry and scanning electron microscopy, we describe the organization of two distinct neural subsystems (subepithelial and mesogleal) and the structure of different receptor types in the comb jelly Beroe abyssicola-the voracious predator from North Pacific. A complex subepithelial neural network of Beroe, with five receptor types, covers the entire body surface and expands deep into the pharynx. Three types of mesogleal neurons are comparable to the cydippid Pleurobrachia. The predatory lifestyle of Beroe is supported by the extensive development of ciliated and muscular structures including the presence of giant muscles and feeding macrocilia. The obtained cell-type atlas illustrates different examples of lineage-specific innovations within these enigmatic marine animals and reveals the remarkable complexity of sensory and effector systems in this clade of basal Metazoa.

AB An inexact accelerated stochastic Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (AS-ADMM) scheme is developed for solving structured separable convex optimization problems with linear constraints. The objective function is the sum of a possibly nonsmooth convex function and a smooth function which is an average of many component convex functions. Problems having this structure often arise in machine learning and data mining applications. AS-ADMM combines the ideas of both ADMM and the stochastic gradient methods using variance reduction techniques. One of the ADMM subproblems employs a linearization technique while a similar linearization could be introduced for the other subproblem. For a specified choice of the algorithm parameters, it is shown that the objective error and the constraint violation are O(1/k) relative to the number of outer iterations k. Under a strong convexity assumption, the expected iterate error converges to zero linearly. A linearized variant of AS-ADMM and incremental sampling strategies are also discussed. Numerical experiments with both stochastic and deterministic ADMM algorithms show that AS-ADMM can be particularly effective for structured optimization arising in big data applications.

AB This work proposes a novel framework for visual tracking based on the integration of an iterative particle filter, a deep convolutional neural network, and a correlation filter. The iterative particle filter enables the particles to correct themselves and converge to the correct target position. We employ a novel strategy to assess the likelihood of the particles after the iterations by applying K-means clustering. Our approach ensures a consistent support for the posterior distribution. Thus, we do not need to perform resampling at every video frame, improving the utilization of prior distribution information. Experimental results on three different benchmark datasets show that our tracker performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods.

AB When working with horses, it is frequently asserted that horses have an inherent understanding of harsh voice cues that would be used as reprimands versus soothing voice cues that may be used as positive reinforcers or calming modifiers. If horses are unable to understand this difference while their handlers assume they can, it may potentially lead to unfair or inappropriate training. A total of 107 horses from 2 different horse facilities in the United States and 7 different horse facilities in Europe were randomly assigned to either soothing voice treatment (SV; n = 58) or harsh voice treatment (HV; n = 49). The learning task involved horses of various breeds and ages learning to cross a tarpaulin. Methodology was standardized across locations. SV involved handlers saying "good horse" in a soft soothing manner whenever horses made forward progress toward the tarpaulin. HV involved saying "quit it" in a loud harsh manner whenever horses made forward progress toward the tarpaulin. Praat software was used to assess similarities in vocal spectrograms and acoustic parameters of different handlers and treatments. Mean pitch for SV and HV was 236.2 +/- 2.2 Hz and 322.1 +/- 8.9 Hz, respectively, both well within the equine hearing range and different at P < 0.001. Average intensity (loudness) for SV and HV was 51.2 +/- 1.7 dB and 61.7 +/- 1.2, respectively, different at P < 0.001. Contrary to our hypotheses, risk of failing the task (>10 minutes to cross the tarpaulin for the first time) was not different between treatments (22.4% failures on SV; 24.5% failures on HV; P = 0.41). Also, for those horses who did cross the tarpaulin, the total time to achieve the calmness criterion (crossing with little or no obvious anxiety) did not differ between treatments (139.9 +/- 50.4 for HV vs. 241.6 +/- 40.3 for SV; P = 0.25). There was no difference between the average heart rate (HR; n = 70 horses) of horses that crossed (82.9 +/- 7.0 beats/minute) versus those that failed (77.4 +/- 6.7; P = 0.43). Also, there was no difference between the average HR of HV horses (85.7 +/- 3.9 beats/minute) versus SV horses (77.9 +/- 3.7 beats/minute; P = 0.16). Furthermore, there was no difference between the maximum HRs, with HV horses registering a mean of 143.4 +/- 11.25 beats/minute and SV horses registering a mean of 166.1 +/- 9.5 beats/minute; P = 0.20. In the context of this study, soothing vocal cues did not enhance horses' ability to perform a novel potentially frightening task. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Predictions of gradient degree of lenition of voiceless and voiced stops in a corpus of Argentine Spanish are evaluated using three acoustic measures (minimum and maximum intensity velocity and duration) and two recurrent neural network (Phonet) measures (posterior probabilities of sonorant and continuant phonological features). While mixed and inconsistent predictions were obtained across the acoustic metrics, sonorant and continuant probability values were consistently in the direction predicted by known factors of a stop's lenition with respect to its voicing, place of articulation, and surrounding contexts. The results suggest the effectiveness of Phonet as an additional or alternative method of lenition measurement. Furthermore, this study has enhanced the accessibility of Phonet by releasing the trained Spanish Phonet model used in this study and a pipeline with step-by-step instructions for training and inferencing new models.

AB For some tropical regions, remote sensing of land cover yields unacceptable results, particularly as the number of land cover classes increases. This research explores the utility of incorporating domain knowledge and multiple algorithms into land cover classifications via a rule-based algorithm for a series of satellite images. The proposed technique integrates the fundamental, knowledge-based interpretation elements of remote sensing without sacrificing the ease and consistency of automated, algorithm-based processing. Compared with results from a traditional maximum likelihood algorithm, classification accuracy was improved substantially for each of the six land cover classes and all three years in the image series. Use of domain knowledge proved effective in accurately classifying problematic tropical land covers, such as tropical deciduous forest and seasonal wetlands. Results also suggest that ancillary data may be most useful in the classification of historic images, where the greatest improvement was observed relative to results from maximum likelihood. The cost of incorporating contextual knowledge and extensive spatial data sets may be justified, since results from the proposed technique suggest a considerable improvement in accuracy may be achieved.

   Dead Spy
SO STUDIES IN COMICS

   children's literature; history; American Revolution
AB Autobiographical accounts of historical violence and trauma in comics form have gained widespread recognition as valuable pedagogical tools, particularly in the wake of Art Spiegelman's groundbreaking Maus (1980-91). These comics often draw from the conventions of text-based autobiographies to provide first-person, non-fiction narratives of historical events, contributing to their perceived legitimacy as 'serious' texts worthy of inclusion in the classroom. However, this narrow focus on autobiographical comics as authentic windows to history has led educators to largely overlook the unique pedagogical possibilities offered by historical fiction comics, which can use both their fictionality and the comics medium to teach young readers to critically engage with history in different and deeper ways than traditional history textbooks and single-narrator autobiographical comics. This article remedies this gap by analysing how Nathan Hale's middle-grade historical fiction comic One Dead Spy enacts a critical pedagogy approach to teach children to challenge hegemonic historical discourses and ways of thinking. The comic centres on the Revolutionary spy Nathan Hale (no relation to the comics creator) as he attempts to delay his hanging by narrating the American Revolution to his executioners. Nathan's purportedly true account hinders children's critical engagement with history by perpetuating dominant historical discourses, providing readers with a whitewashed, male-centric narrative of the Revolution. By contrast, the backmatter complicates Nathan's one-sided representation of history by featuring a mini-comic narrated by the former slave Crispus Attucks and by attributing the comic's non-fiction bibliography to fictional Research Babies. This blending of academic citational practices with absurd metafiction, as well as the introduction of marginalized counter-narrators, teaches middle-grade readers to question the authority of history writers and destabilizes all historical narratives as artificial constructs. However, the paratext also reinforces racist and sexist paradigms by displacing black and female voices to the comic's supplemental endpapers, underwriting the comic's well-intentioned attempts to educate readers about important voices excluded from white-centric narratives. Thus, while One Dead Spy demonstrates how historical fiction comics can provoke much-needed discussions about the inherent biases and erasures of dominant historical discourses, it also reveals the dangers of relegating opportunities for children to learn about marginalized perspectives in history to the literal margins.

AB Goosegrass is a problematic weed species in Florida vegetable plasticulture production. To reduce costs associated with goosegrass control, a post-emergence precision applicator is under development for use atop the planting beds. To facilitate in situ goosegrass detection and spraying, tiny-You Only Look Once 3 (YOLOv3-tiny) was evaluated as a potential detector. Two annotation techniques were evaluated: (1) annotation of the entire plant (EP) and (2) annotation of partial sections of the leaf blade (LB). For goosegrass detection in strawberry, the F-score was 0.75 and 0.85 for the EP and LB derived networks, respectively. For goosegrass detection in tomato, the F-score was 0.56 and 0.65 for the EP and LB derived networks, respectively. The LB derived networks increased recall at the cost of precision, compared to the EP derived networks. The LB annotation method demonstrated superior results within the context of production and precision spraying, ensuring more targets were sprayed with some over-spraying on false targets. The developed network provides online, real-time, and in situ detection capability for weed management field applications such as precision spraying and autonomous scouts.

AB We argue for expanding the role of theory in ecology to accelerate scientific progress, enhance the ability to address environmental challenges, foster the development of synthesis and unification, and improve the design of experiments and large-scale environmental-monitoring programs. To achieve these goals, it is essential to foster the development of what we call efficient theories, which have several key attributes. Efficient theories are grounded in first principles, are usually expressed in the language of mathematics, make few assumptions and generate a large number of predictions per free parameter, are approximate, and entail predictions that provide well-understood standards for comparison with empirical data. We contend that the development and successive refinement of efficient theories provide a solid foundation for advancing environmental science in the era of big data.

ID SUBPHENOTYPES
AB OBJECTIVE:Despite its heterogeneous phenotypes, sepsis or life-threatening dysfunction in response to infection is often treated empirically. Identifying patient subgroups with unique pathophysiology and treatment response is critical to the advancement of sepsis care. However, phenotyping methods and results are as heterogeneous as the disease itself. This scoping review evaluates the prognostic capabilities and treatment implications of adult sepsis and septic shock phenotyping methods.DATA SOURCES:Medline and Embase.STUDY SELECTION:We included clinical studies that described sepsis or septic shock and used any clustering method to identify sepsis phenotypes. We excluded conference abstracts, literature reviews, comments, letters to the editor, and in vitro studies. We assessed study quality using a validated risk of bias tool for observational cohort and cross-sectional studies.DATA EXTRACTION:We extracted population, methodology, validation, and phenotyping characteristics from 17 studies.DATA SYNTHESIS:Sepsis phenotyping methods most frequently grouped patients based on the degree of inflammatory response and coagulopathy using clinical, nongenomic variables. Five articles clustered patients based on genomic or transcriptomic data. Seven articles generated patient subgroups with differential response to sepsis treatments. Cluster clinical characteristics and their associations with mortality and treatment response were heterogeneous across studies, and validity was evaluated in nine of 17 articles, hindering pooled analysis of results and derivation of universal truths regarding sepsis phenotypes, their prognostic capabilities, and their associations with treatment response.CONCLUSIONS:Sepsis phenotyping methods can identify high-risk patients and those with high probability of responding well to targeted treatments. Research quality was fair, but achieving generalizability and clinical impact of sepsis phenotyping will require external validation and direct comparison with alternative approaches.

AB Quantifying certain physiological traits under heat-stress is crucial for maximizing genetic gain for wheat yield and yield-related components. In-season estimation of different physiological traits related to heat stress tolerance can ensure the finding of germplasm, which could help in making effective genetic gains in yield. However, estimation of those complex traits is time- and labor-intensive. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based hyperspectral imaging could be a powerful tool to estimate indirectly in-season genetic variation for different complex physiological traits in plant breeding that could improve genetic gains for different important economic traits, like grain yield. This study aims to predict in-season genetic variations for cellular membrane thermostability (CMT), yield and yield related traits based on spectral data collected from UAVs; particularly, in cases where there is a small sample size to collect data from and a large range of features collected per sample. In these cases, traditional methods of yield-prediction modeling become less robust. To handle this, a functional regression approach was employed that addresses limitations of previous techniques to create a model for predicting CMT, grain yield and other traits in wheat under heat stress environmental conditions and when data availability is constrained. The results preliminarily indicate that the overall models of each trait studied presented a good accuracy compared to their data's standard deviation. The yield prediction model presented an average error of 13.42%, showing the function-on-function algorithm chosen for the model as reliable for small datasets with high dimensionality.

ID THINGS
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) becomes a novel paradigm as more and more devices are connected to the Internet, enabling several innovative applications such as smart home, industrial automation, and connected health. However, the cyber-attack to these applications is a big issue and countermeasures are in dire need to provide system security and user privacy. In this paper, we address the traffic analysis attack to smart homes, where adversaries intercept the Internet traffic from/to the smart home gateway and profile residents' behaviors through digital traces. Traditional cryptographic tools may not work well due to the effectiveness of adversaries' machine learning algorithms in classifying encrypted traffic, so here we propose a privacy-preserving traffic obfuscation framework to achieve the goal. To be specific, we leverage the smart community network of wirelessly connected smart homes and intentionally direct each smart home's traffic to another home gateway before entering the Internet. The design jointly considers the network energy consumption and the resource constraints in IoT devices, while achieving strong differential privacy guarantee so that adversaries cannot link any traffic flow to a specific smart home. Besides, we consider a hostile smart community network and develop secure multihop routing protocols to guarantee the source/destination unlinkability and satisfy each user's personalized privacy requirement. To evaluate the effectiveness of our framework in protecting privacy and reducing network energy consumption, extensive simulations are conducted and the results demonstrate that our design outperforms other differential privacy mechanism in preserving privacy and minimizing network utility cost.

ID REPRESENTATION
AB Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) usually use top-level appearance features of video frames for action recognition. However, these methods discard the implicit complementary advantages across different-scale appearance representations which are effective for object detection, instance segmentation and person re-identification. In this paper, a new spatial pyramid module is proposed to take full use of inherent multi-scale information of CNNs with nearly cost-free by which a bottom-up architecture with lateral connections is constructed for combining high-, mid-, low-level representations of CNNs into a hierarchical frame-level feature elaborately. Additionally, temporal relations at appropriate timescale are contributed to the identification of an action. To this end, we also propose a new temporal pyramid module in which frame-level features belonged to one video are reused by various timescale pooling approaches to get different time-grained features of snippets efficiently. Followed by snippet-relation reasoning, different timescale temporal relations are derived and accumulated for the comprehensive prediction. Unifying the proposed spatial and temporal pyramid modules, a novel network, Spatial-Temporal Pyramid Network (S-TPNet), is proposed to extract spatial-temporal pyramid features for action recognition in videos. Unlike previous models which boost performance at the cost of computation, S-TPNet can be trained in an end-to-end fashion with great efficiency. Extensive experiments on Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51 demonstrate that S-TPNet displays significant performance improvements compared with existing frameworks and obtains competitive performance with the state-of-the-arts.(1) (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB Explaining the factors that influence past dietary variation is critically important for understanding changes in subsistence, health, and status in past societies; yet systematic studies comparing possible driving factors remain scarce. Here we compile the largest dataset of past diet derived from stable isotope delta C-13 parts per thousand and delta N-15 parts per thousand values in the Americas to quantitatively evaluate the impact of 7000 years of climatic and demographic change on dietary variation in the Central Andes. Specifically, we couple paleoclimatic data from a general circulation model with estimates of relative past population inferred from archaeologically derived radiocarbon dates to assess the influence of climate and population on spatiotemporal dietary variation using an ensemble machine learning model capable of accounting for interactions among predictors. Results reveal that climate and population strongly predict diet (80% of delta 15N parts per thousand and 66% of delta 13C parts per thousand) and that Central Andean diets correlate much more strongly with local climatic conditions than regional population size, indicating that the past 7000 years of dietary change was influenced more by climatic than socio-demographic processes. Visually, the temporal pattern suggests decreasing dietary variation across elevation zones during the Late Horizon, raising the possibility that sociopolitical factors overrode the influence of local climatic conditions on diet during that time. The overall findings and approach establish a general framework for understanding the influence of local climate and demography on dietary change across human history.

TI Video object detection for autonomous driving: Motion-aid feature

SO NEUROCOMPUTING
LA English
DT Article
DE Video object detection; Autonomous driving; Motion estimation
AB This paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning framework, termed as motion-aid feature calibration network (MFCN), for video object detection. The key idea is to leverage on the temporal coherence of video features while considering their motion patterns as captured by optical flow. To boost detection accuracy, the framework aggregates the calibrated features both at pixel and instance levels across frames to achieve improved robustness despite appearance variations. The aggregation and calibration are efficiently and adaptively conducted based on an integrated optical flow network. Meanwhile, the entire architecture of the proposed method is end-to-end, thus significantly improving its training and inference efficiency when compared to multi-stage methods for video object detection. Evaluations on KITTI and ImageNet VID indicate that MFCN can improve the results of a strong still-image detector by 11.2% and 7.31% respectively. MFCN also outperforms other competitive video object detectors and achieves a better trade-off between accuracy and runtime speed, demonstrating its potential for use in autonomous driving systems.

AB Crop frost, one kind of agro-meteorological disaster, often causes significant loss to agriculture. Thus, evaluating the risk of wheat frost aids scientific response to such disasters, which will ultimately promote food security. Therefore, this paper aims to propose an integrated risk assessment model of wheat frost, based on meteorological data and a hybrid fuzzy neural network model, taking China as an example. With the support of a geographic information system (GIS), a comprehensive method was put forward. Firstly, threshold temperatures of wheat frost at three growth stages were proposed, referring to phenology in different wheat growing areas and the meteorological standard of Degree of Crop Frost Damage (QX/T 88-2008). Secondly, a vulnerability curve illustrating the relationship between frost hazard intensity and wheat yield loss was worked out using hybrid fuzzy neural network model. Finally, the wheat frost risk was assessed in China. Results show that our proposed threshold temperatures are more suitable than using 0 degrees C in revealing the spatial pattern of frost occurrence, and hybrid fuzzy neural network model can further improve the accuracy of the vulnerability curve of wheat subject to frost with limited historical hazard records. Both these advantages ensure the precision of wheat frost risk assessment. In China, frost widely distributes in 85.00% of the total winter wheat planting area, but mainly to the north of 35 degrees N; the southern boundary of wheat frost has moved northward, potentially because of the warming climate. There is a significant trend that suggests high risk areas will enlarge and gradually expand to the south, with the risk levels increasing from a return period of 2 years to 20 years. Among all wheat frost risk levels, the regions with loss rate ranges from 35.00% to 45.00% account for the largest area proportion, ranging from 58.60% to 63.27%. We argue that for wheat and other frost-affected crops, it is necessary to take the risk level, physical exposure, and growth stages of crops into consideration together for frost disaster risk prevention planning.

AB Skeletal muscle has the remarkable ability to regenerate. However, with age and disease muscle strength and function decline. Myofiber size, which is affected by injury and disease, is a critical measurement to assess muscle health. Here, we test and apply Cellpose, a recently developed deep learning algorithm, to automatically segment myofibers within murine skeletal muscle. We first show that tissue fixation is necessary to preserve cellular structures such as primary cilia, small cellular antennae, and adipocyte lipid droplets. However, fixation generates heterogeneous myofiber labeling, which impedes intensity-based segmentation. We demonstrate that Cellpose efficiently delineates thousands of individual myofibers outlined by a variety of markers, even within fixed tissue with highly uneven myofiber staining. We created a novel ImageJ plugin (LabelsToRois) that allows processing of multiple Cellpose segmentation images in batch. The plugin also contains a semi-automatic erosion function to correct for the area bias introduced by the different stainings, thereby identifying myofibers as accurately as human experts. We successfully applied our segmentation pipeline to uncover myofiber regeneration differences between two different muscle injury models, cardiotoxin and glycerol. Thus, Cellpose combined with LabelsToRois allows for fast, unbiased, and reproducible myofiber quantification for a variety of staining and fixation conditions.

AB In this paper, we present an optical stimulation based approach to induce 1:1 in-phase synchrony in a network of coupled interneurons wherein each interneuron expresses the light sensitive protein channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2). We begin with a transition rate model for the channel kinetics of ChR2 in response to light stimulation. We then define "functional optical time response curve (fOTRC)" as a measure of the response of a periodically firing interneuron (transfected with ChR2 ion channel) to a periodic light pulse stimulation. We specifically consider the case of unidirectionally coupled (UCI) network and propose an open loop control architecture that uses light as an actuation signal to induce 1:1 in-phase synchrony in the UCI network. Using general properties of the spike time response curves (STRCs) for Type-1 neuron model (Ermentrout, Neural Comput 8:979-1001, 1996) and fOTRC, we estimate the (open loop) optimal actuation signal parameters required to induce 1:1 in-phase synchrony. We then propose a closed loop controller architecture and a controller algorithm to robustly sustain stable 1:1 in-phase synchrony in the presence of unknown deviations in the network parameters. Finally, we test the performance of this closed-loop controller in a network of mutually coupled (MCI) interneurons.

AB This study investigates the electrophysiological properties and functional integration of different phenotypes of transplanted human neural precursor cells (hNPCs) in immunodeficient NSG mice. Postnatal day 2 mice received unilateral injections of 100,000 GFP+hNPCs into the right parietal cortex. Eight weeks after transplantation, 1.21% of transplanted hNPCs survived. In these hNPCs, parvalbumin (PV)-, calretinin (CR)-, somatostatin (SS)-positive inhibitory interneurons and excitatory pyramidal neurons were confirmed electrophysiologically and histologically. All GFP+ hNPCs were immunoreactive with antihuman specific nuclear protein. The proportions of PV-, CR-, and SS-positive cells among GFP+cells were 35.5%, 15.7%, and 17.1%, respectively; around 15% of GFP+ cells were identified as pyramidal neurons. Those electrophysiologically and histological identified GFP+hNPCs were shown to fire action potentials with the appropriate firing patterns for different classes of neurons and to display spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs and sIPSCs). The amplitude, frequency and kinetic properties of sEPSCs and sIPSCs in different types of hNPCs were comparable to host cells of the same type. In conclusion, GFP+ hNPCs produce neurons that are competent to integrate functionally into host neocortical neuronal networks. This provides promising data on the potential for hNPCs to serve as therapeutic agents in neurological diseases with abnormal neuronal circuitry such as epilepsy.

TI DUET: Data-Driven Approach Based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation Topic

DE Disaster informatics; Emergency detection; Latent Dirichlet allocation

AB Social networking platforms have been widely employed to detect and track physical events in population-dense urban areas. They can be effective tools to understand what happens and when and where it happens, either retrospectively or in real time. Correspondingly, a variety of approaches have been proposed for detecting either targeted or general events. However, neither type of event detection technique has been developed to detect urban emergencies that happen in specific geographic locations and with unpredictable characteristics. Therefore, we propose a spatial and data-driven detecting urban emergencies technique (DUET) for natural hazards, manmade disasters, and other emergencies. The method addresses both geographic and semantic dimensions of events using a geotopic detection module and evaluates their crisis levels on the basis of the intensity of negative sentiment through a ranking module. DUET was designed specifically for georeferenced tweets from a Twitter streaming application programming interface (API). To validate the technique, we conducted multiple experiments with geotagged tweets in different urban environments over a period of four to six consecutive hours. DUET successfully identified emergencies of different types among all the candidate geotopics. Our future work focuses on enabling online-mode detection with high scalability with large volumes of streaming data and providing interactive visualization through a GIS system. DUET can identify emergencies of general types and provide timely emergency reports both to first responders and to the public. The technique contributes to building an efficient and open disaster information system through a crowdsourcing effort and adding agility to urban resilience regarding crisis detection, situation awareness, and information diffusion.

TI MODELING OF SQUID PROTEIN HYDROLYSIS: ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK APPROACH
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD PROCESS ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
ID FUNCTIONAL-PROPERTIES
AB The processing of squid generates nearly 50% of raw material as a waste by-product rich in protein. Use of this by-product as a raw material in the manufacture of a squid protein hydrolysate would add considerable product value to the industry. Enzyme hydrolysis of squid waste protein is a complex process because of a number of inherent simultaneous inhibition and enzyme inactivation reactions which occur during hydrolysis. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are very effective in developing predictive models for processes involving complex reaction kinetics that would otherwise be difficult to develop by more traditional deterministic approaches. The objective of this work was to develop a kinetic model to describe the kinetics of enzyme hydrolysis of squid waste protein using ANNs. A series of enzyme hydrolysis experiments were carried out on samples of squid waste under specified conditions of temperature, pH, and initial enzyme and substrate concentrations. Experimental data in the form of substrate concentration over time were taken as real time course data. These data were fitted with a cubic spline procedure for use in an ANNs training process to estimate reaction rates for the model. The effect of a number of hidden processing elements on the error in prediction was studied, and the ANN showing necessary prediction performance was constructed. Maximum differences between experimental and predicted values of substrate concentration at any point in time ranged from 0.098 to 0.29 g/L (34%). Correlation coefficients between predicted and experimental results were also, respectively, high, ranging from 0.988 to 0.992.

ID EEG-EOG; SYSTEM
AB Three different methods of automated sleep staging are described and compared in the paper. The interesting aspect of the comparison is that the inputs to the three different information processing models (an expert system, a belief automaton, and a neural network) are the outputs of the same frontend processor that extracts EEG features. We found out that the level of man-machine agreement is very similar among the systems (around 85%) approaching the level of agreement required among human experts. However, the similarity of performance in such a diversified set of approaches points out the need for enhancing the accuracy of the first level of analysis (EEG feature extraction).

AB Estimating canopy volumes of strawberry plants can be useful for predicting yields and establishing advanced management plans. Therefore, this study evaluated the spatial variability of strawberry canopy volumes using a ResNet50V2-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained with RGB images acquired through manual unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) flights equipped with a digital color camera. A preprocessing method based on the You Only Look Once v8 Nano (YOLOv8n) object detection model was applied to correct image distortions influenced by fluctuating flight altitude under a manual maneuver. The CNN model was trained using actual canopy volumes measured using a cylindrical case and small expanded polystyrene (EPS) balls to account for internal plant spaces. Estimated canopy volumes using the CNN with flight altitude compensation closely matched the canopy volumes measured with EPS balls (nearly 1:1 relationship). The model achieved a slope, coefficient of determination (R2), and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.98, 0.98, and 74.3 cm3, respectively, corresponding to an 84% improvement over the conventional paraboloid shape approximation. In the application tests, the canopy volume map of the entire strawberry field was generated, highlighting the spatial variability of the plant's canopy volumes, which is crucial for implementing site-specific management of strawberry crops.

AB In this article, we survey existing academic and commercial efforts to provide Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) acceleration in datacenters and the cloud. The goal is a critical review of existing systems and a discussion of their evolution from single workstations with PCI-attached FPGAs in the early days of reconfigurable computing to the integration of FPGA farms in large-scale computing infrastructures. From the lessons learned, we discuss the future of FPGAs in datacenters and the cloud and assess the challenges likely to be encountered along the way. The article explores current architectures and discusses scalability and abstractions supported by operating systems, middleware, and virtualization. Hardware and software security becomes critical when infrastructure is shared among tenants with disparate backgrounds. We review the vulnerabilities of current systems and possible attack scenarios and discuss mitigation strategies, some of which impact FPGA architecture and technology. The viability of these architectures for popular applications is reviewed, with a particular focus on deep learning and scientific computing. This work draws from workshop discussions, panel sessions including the participation of experts in the reconfigurable computing field, and private discussions among these experts. These interactions have harmonized the terminology, taxonomy, and the important topics covered in this manuscript.

AB Understanding clinical trajectories of sepsis patients is crucial for prognostication, resource planning, and to inform digital twin models of critical illness. This study aims to identify common clinical trajectories based on dynamic assessment of cardiorespiratory support using a validated electronic health record data that covers retrospective cohort of 19,177 patients with sepsis admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) of Mayo Clinic Hospitals over 8-year period. Patient trajectories were modeled from ICU admission up to 14 days using an unsupervised machine learning two-stage clustering method based on cardiorespiratory support in ICU and hospital discharge status. Of 19,177 patients, 42% were female with a median age of 65 (interquartile range [IQR], 55-76) years, The Acute Physiology, Age, and Chronic Health Evaluation III score of 70 (IQR, 56-87), hospital length of stay (LOS) of 7 (IQR, 4-12) days, and ICU LOS of 2 (IQR, 1-4) days. Four distinct trajectories were identified: fast recovery (27% with a mortality rate of 3.5% and median hospital LOS of 3 (IQR, 2-15) days), slow recovery (62% with a mortality rate of 3.6% and hospital LOS of 8 (IQR, 6-13) days), fast decline (4% with a mortality rate of 99.7% and hospital LOS of 1 (IQR, 0-1) day), and delayed decline (7% with a mortality rate of 97.9% and hospital LOS of 5 (IQR, 3-8) days). Distinct trajectories remained robust and were distinguished by Charlson Comorbidity Index, The Acute Physiology, Age, and Chronic Health Evaluation III scores, as well as day 1 and day 3 SOFA (P < 0.001 ANOVA). These findings provide a foundation for developing prediction models and digital twin decision support tools, improving both shared decision making and resource planning.

AB Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) phenomena are of interest in several engineering fields. It is highly desirable to develop computationally efficient models to predict the dynamics of FSI. The complexity of modeling lies in the highly non-linear response of both the fluid and structure. The current study proposes an overall model containing two blocks corresponding to a force model and a structural model. The force model consists of two submodels: one for the amplitude and one for the frequency, where the latter is composed of an input/output linear model and a non-linear corrector. The amplitude submodel and the non-linear corrector term in the frequency submodel are modeled using an Hammerstein-Wiener modeling technique in which the non-linear input and output functions are determined by training neural networks using a training dataset. The current model is tested on a well-known fluid-structure interaction problem: a suspended rigid cylinder immersed in a flow at a low Reynolds number regime that exhibits a non-linear behavior. First, a training dataset is generated for a given input profile using a high-fidelity numerical simulation and it is used to train the reduced-order model. Subsequently, the trained model is given a different input profile (i.e., a validation profile) to compare its predictive capability against the high-fidelity numerical simulation. The validation profile is significantly different from the one used for training. The predictive performance of the current reduced-order model is further compared with the results obtained from a reduced-order model that uses polynomial fitting. We demonstrate that the current model provides a superior performance for the validation profile, i.e., it results in a better prediction.

AB Neurofeedback procedures are attracting increasing attention in the neuroscience community. Based on the principle that participants, through suitable feedback, may learn to affect specific aspects of their brain activity, neurofeedback interventions have been applied to basic research, translational, and clinical science. A large segment of the available empirical research as well as review articles have focused on the extent to which neurofeedback interventions affect mental health outcomes, cognitive capacity, aging, and other complex be-haviors. Another segment has aimed to characterize the extent to which neurofeedback affects the targeted neural processes. At this time, there is no current systematic review of the effects of neurofeedback on healthy participants' performance in experimental tasks. Such a review is relevant in this rapidly evolving field because changes in experimental task performance are traditionally considered a hallmark of changing neurocognitive processes, often established in neurotypical individuals. This systematic review addresses this gap in the liter-ature using the PRISMA method, building on earlier reviews on the same topic. Empirical studies using EEG or fMRI to alter brain processes linked to established cognitive and affective laboratory tasks were reviewed. Systematic quality assessment and z-curve analyses were also conducted. Substantial variability was found regarding the study designs used, the implementation of the feedback, and the neural targets of feedback. Importantly, only a minority of the studies reported statistically meaningful effects of neurofeedback on per-formance in cognitive and affective tasks. The z-curve analyses found no evidence for reporting bias or unsound research practices. Quality control and effect size analyses showed few systematic relations between study characteristics such as sample size or experimental control on the one hand and outcome on the other. Overall, the present study does not support strong effects of NFT on performance in laboratory tasks. Implications for future work are discussed.

ID DIVERSITY
AB Metatranscriptome analysis or the analysis of the expression profiles of whole microbial communities has the additional challenge of dealing with a complex system with dozens of different organisms expressing genes simultaneously. An underlying issue for virtually all metatranscriptomic sequencing experiments is how to allocate the limited sequencing budget while guaranteeing that the libraries have sufficient depth to cover the breadth of expression of the community. Estimating the required sequencing depth to effectively sample the target metatranscriptome using RNA-seq is an essential first step to obtain robust results in subsequent analysis and to avoid overexpansion, once the information contained in the library reaches saturation. Here, we present a method to calculate the sequencing effort using a simulated series of metatranscriptomic/metagenomic matrices. This method is based on an extrapolation rarefaction curve using a Weibull growth model to estimate the maximum number of observed genes as a function of sequencing depth. This approach allowed us to compute the effort at different confidence intervals and to obtain an approximate a priori effort based on an initial fraction of sequences. The analytical pipeline presented here may be successfully used for the in-depth and time-effective characterization of complex microbial communities, representing a useful tool for the microbiome research community.

AB Background Acute alcohol intoxication has wide-ranging neurobehavioral effects on psychomotor, attentional, inhibitory, and memory-related cognitive processes. These effects are mirrored in disruption of neural metabolism, functional activation, and functional network coherence. Metrics of intraregional neural dynamics such as regional signal variability (RSV) and brain entropy (BEN) may capture unique aspects of neural functional capacity in healthy and clinical populations; however, alcohol's influence on these metrics is unclear. The present study aimed to elucidate the influence of acute alcohol intoxication on RSV and to clarify these effects with subsequent BEN analyses. Methods 26 healthy adults between 25 and 45 years of age (65.4% women) participated in 2 counterbalanced sessions. In one, participants consumed a beverage containing alcohol sufficient to produce a breath alcohol concentration of 0.08 g/dl. In the other, they consumed a placebo beverage. Approximately 35 minutes after beverage consumption, participants completed a 9-minute resting-state fMRI scan. Whole-brain, voxel-wise standard deviation was used to assess RSV, which was compared between sessions. Within clusters displaying alterations in RSV, sample entropy was calculated to assess BEN. Results Compared to the placebo, alcohol intake resulted in widespread reductions in RSV in the bilateral middle frontal, right inferior frontal, right superior frontal, bilateral posterior cingulate, bilateral middle temporal, right supramarginal gyri, and bilateral inferior parietal lobule. Within these clusters, significant reductions in BEN were found in the bilateral middle frontal and right superior frontal gyri. No effects were noted in subcortical or cerebellar areas. Conclusions Findings indicate that alcohol intake produces diffuse reductions in RSV among structures associated with attentional processes. Within these structures, signal complexity was also reduced in a subset of frontal regions. Neurobehavioral effects of acute alcohol consumption may be partially driven by disruption of intraregional neural dynamics among regions involved in higher-order cognitive and attentional processes.

AB We present slick (the Scalable Line Intensity Computation Kit), a software package that calculates realistic CO, [C I], and [C II] luminosities for clouds and galaxies formed in hydrodynamic simulations. Built on the radiative transfer code despotic, slick computes the thermal, radiative, and statistical equilibrium in concentric zones of model clouds, based on their physical properties and individual environments. We validate our results by applying slick to the high-resolution run of the Simba simulations, testing the derived luminosities against empirical and theoretical/analytic relations. To simulate the line emission from a universe of emitting clouds, we have incorporated random forest machine learning (ML) methods into our approach, allowing us to predict cosmologically evolving properties of CO, [C I], and [C II] emission from galaxies such as luminosity functions. We tested this model in 100,000 gas particles, and 2500 galaxies, reaching an average accuracy of similar to 99.8% for all lines. Finally, we present the first model light cones created with realistic and ML-predicted CO, [C I], and [C II] luminosities in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, from z = 0 to z = 10.

AB Conventional statistical process control tools monitor either continuous or count data but rarely both simultaneously. While process data are becoming increasingly complex, there will be more data points containing both continuous and count information. In the case of mixed continuous and count data with unknown distributions, the traditional parameter control chart cannot be used to monitor them. It is proposed in this paper a novel nonparametric EWMA control chart to monitor mixed continuous and count data. The mixed continuous and count data are first transformed into categorical data, and then a log-linear model is utilized to analyze correlations between variables, followed by the construction of an EWMA statistic that is used to monitor mixed continuous and count data. Next, the proposed control chart is compared with several improved control charts for monitoring mixed continuous and count data. Based on the numerical simulation results, the control chart presented in this paper provides a superior method of detecting alarm signals in the process compared to some improved control charts. Finally, the proposed control chart is demonstrated to be effective and applicable using the semiconductor manufacturing process dataset from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.

AB Background: Microbial communities can be location specific, and the abundance of species within locations can influence our ability to determine whether a sample belongs to one city or another. As part of the 2017 CAMDA MetaSUB Inter-City Challenge, next generation sequencing (NGS) data was generated from swipe samples collected from subway stations in Boston, New York City hereafter New York, and Sacramento. DNA was extracted and Illumina sequenced. Sequencing data was provided for all cities as part of 2017 CAMDA contest challenge dataset.
   Results: Principal component analysis (PCA) showed clear clustering of the samples for the three cities, with a substantial proportion of the variance explained by the first three components. We ran two different classifiers and results were robust for error rate (< 6%) and accuracy (> 95%). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) demonstrated that overall, bacterial composition across the three cities is significantly different. A similar conclusion was reached using a novel bootstrap based test using diversity indices. Last but not least, a co-abundance association network analyses for the taxonomic levels "order", "family", and "genus" found different patterns of bacterial networks for the three cities.
   Conclusions: Bacterial fingerprint can be useful to predict sample provenance. In this work prediction of provenance reported with over 95% accuracy. Association based network analysis, emphasized similarities between the closest cities sharing common bacterial composition. ANOVA showed different patterns of bacterial amongst cities, and these findings strongly suggest that bacterial signature across multiple cities are different. This work advocates a data analysis pipeline which could be followed in order to get biological insight from this data. However, the biological conclusions from this analysis is just an early indication out of a pilot microbiome data provided to us through CAMDA 2017 challenge and will be subject to change as we get more complete data sets in the near future. This microbiome data can have potential applications in forensics, ecology, and other sciences.

AB Understanding the genetic components of Alzheimer's disease (AD) via transcriptome analysis often necessitates the use of invasive methods. This work focuses on overcoming the difficulties associated with the invasive process of collecting brain tissue samples in order to measure and investigate the transcriptome behavior of AD. Our approach called IDEEA (Information D iffusion model for integrating gene E xpression and E EG data in identifying A lzheimer's disease markers) involves systematically linking two different but complementary modalities: transcriptomics and electroencephalogram (EEG) data. We preprocess these two data types by calculating the spectral and transcriptional sample distances, over 11 brain regions encompassing 6 distinct frequency bands. Subsequently, we employ a genetic algorithm approach to integrate the distinct features of the preprocessed data. Our experimental results show that IDEEA converges rapidly to local optima gene subsets, in fewer than 250 iterations. Our algorithm identifies novel genes along with genes that have previously been linked to AD. It is also capable of detecting genes with transcription patterns specific to individual EEG bands as well as those with common patterns among bands. In particular, the alpha2 (10-13 Hz) frequency band yielded 8 AD-associated genes out of the top 100 most frequently selected genes by our algorithm, with a p-value of 0.05. Our method not only identifies AD-related genes but also genes that interact with AD genes in terms of transcription regulation. We evaluated various aspects of our approach, including the genetic algorithm performance, band-pair association and gene interaction topology. Our approach reveals AD-relevant genes with transcription patterns inferred from EEG alone, across various frequency bands, avoiding the risky brain tissue collection process. This is a significant advancement toward the early identification of AD using non-invasive EEG recordings.

AB In models of visual spatial attention control, it is commonly held that top-down control signals originate in the dorsal attention network, propagating to the visual cortex to modulate baseline neural activity and bias sensory processing. However, the precise distribution of these top-down influences across different levels of the visual hierarchy is debated. In addition, it is unclear whether these baseline neural activity changes translate into improved performance. We analyzed attention-related baseline activity during the anticipatory period of a voluntary spatial attention task, using two independent functional magnetic resonance imaging datasets and two analytic approaches. First, as in prior studies, univariate analysis showed that covert attention significantly enhanced baseline neural activity in higher-order visual areas contralateral to the attended visual hemifield, while effects in lower-order visual areas (e.g., V1) were weaker and more variable. Second, in contrast, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) revealed significant decoding of attention conditions across all visual cortical areas, with lower-order visual areas exhibiting higher decoding accuracies than higher-order areas. Third, decoding accuracy, rather than the magnitude of univariate activation, was a better predictor of a subject's stimulus discrimination performance. Finally, the MVPA results were replicated across two experimental conditions, where the direction of spatial attention was either externally instructed by a cue or based on the participants' free choice decision about where to attend. Together, these findings offer new insights into the extent of attentional biases in the visual hierarchy under top-down control and how these biases influence both sensory processing and behavioral performance.

AB Sleep apnea is characterized by momentary interruptions in normal respiration and leads to periods of decreased oxygen, or intermittent hypoxia. Chronic intermittent hypoxia is a model of the hypoxemia associated with sleep apnea and results in a sustained hypertension that is maintained during normoxia. Adaptations of the carotid body and activation of the renin-angiotensin system may contribute to the development of hypertension associated with chronic intermittent hypoxia. The subsequent activation of the brain renin-angiotensin system may produce changes in sympathetic regulatory neural networks that support the maintenance of the hypertension associated with intermittent hypoxia. Hypertension and sleep apnea not only increase risk for cardiovascular disease but are also risk factors for cognitive decline and Alzheimer?s disease. Activation of the angiotensin system could be a common mechanism that links these disorders.

AB A common approach to training neural network classifiers in a supervised learning setting is to minimize the mean-square error (mse) between the network output for each labeled training sample and some desired output. In the context of landmine detection and discrimination, although the performance of an algorithm is correlated with the ruse, it is ultimately evaluated by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. In general, the larger the area under the ROC curve (AUC), the better. We present a new method for maximizing the AUC. Desirable properties of the proposed algorithm are derived and discussed that differentiate it from previously proposed algorithms. A hypothesis test is used to compare the proposed algorithm to an existing algorithm. The false alarm rate achieved by the proposed algorithm is found to be less than that of the existing algorithm with 95% confidence.

AB Understanding how new cell types arise is critical for understanding the evolution of organismal complexity. Questions of this nature, however, can be difficult to answer due to the challenge associated with defining the identity of a truly novel cell. Cnidarians (anemones, jellies, and their allies) provide a unique opportunity to investigate the molecular regulation and development of cell-novelty because they possess a cell that is unique to the cnidarian lineage and that also has a very well-characterized phenotype: the cnidocyte (stinging cell). Because cnidocytes are thought to differentiate from the cell lineage that also gives rise to neurons, cnidocytes can be expected to express many of the same genes expressed in their neural "sister" cells. Conversely, only cnidocytes posses a cnidocyst (the explosive organelle that gives cnidocytes their sting); therefore, those genes or gene-regulatory relationships required for the development of the cnidocyst can be expected to be expressed uniquely (or in unique combination) in cnidocytes. This system provides an important opportunity to: (1) construct the gene-regulatory network (GRN) underlying the differentiation of cnidocytes, (2) assess the relative contributions of both conserved and derived genes in the cnidocyte GRN, and (3) test hypotheses about the role of novel regulatory relationships in the generation of novel cell types. In this review, we summarize common challenges to studying the evolution of novelty, introduce the utility of cnidocyte differentiation in the model cnidarian, Nematostella vectensis, as a means of overcoming these challenges, and describe an experimental approach that leverages comparative tissue-specific transcriptomics to generate hypotheses about the GRNs underlying the acquisition of the cnidocyte identity.

AB Systematic reviews are a time-consuming yet effective approach to understanding research trends. While researchers have investigated how to speed up the process of screening studies for potential inclusion, few have focused on to what extent we can use algorithms to extract data instead of human coders. In this study, we explore to what extent analyses and algorithms can produce results similar to human data extraction during a scoping review-a type of systematic review aimed at understanding the nature of the field rather than the efficacy of an intervention-in the context of a never before analyzed sample of studies that were intended for a scoping review. Specifically, we tested five approaches: bibliometric analysis with VOSviewer, latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) with bag of words, k-means clustering with TF-IDF, Sentence-BERT, or SPECTER, hierarchical clustering with Sentence-BERT, and BERTopic. Our results showed that topic modeling approaches (LDA/BERTopic) and k-means clustering identified specific, but often narrow research areas, leaving a substantial portion of the sample unclassified or in unclear topics. Meanwhile, bibliometric analysis and hierarchical clustering with SBERT were more informative for our purposes, identifying key author networks and categorizing studies into distinct themes as well as reflecting the relationships between themes, respectively. Overall, we highlight the capabilities and limitations of each method and discuss how these techniques can complement traditional human data extraction methods. We conclude that the analyses tested here likely cannot fully replace human data extraction in scoping reviews but serve as valuable supplements.

AB Individual microbes often have defined relationships with their hosts that include beneficial, commensal, and pathogenic interactions. However, at the community level, plant microbiomes are considered to play a beneficial role in protecting the plant from potential pathogens, acquiring nutrients, and improving growth and production. Citrus is a globally important perennial fruit crop and its production faces many challenges. There has been tremendous interest in exploring the structure and function of the citrus microbiome and engineering the citrus microbiome to address various challenges. In this review, we summarized recent advances in understanding the citrus microbiome, including the composition and function of the microbiome in the rhizosphere, rhizoplane, endorhiza, and core members, and their functional traits. We conducted comparisons of the citrus root-associated microbiome with other plant root-associated microbiomes. We also present a perspective on how incoming pathogens interact with the resident microbial community and their outcomes. Despite the promising potential of the citrus microbiome to combat disease, harnessing the citrus microbiome for beneficial applications remains in its infancy. We envision that rapid development of high-throughput sequencing and multiomics technologies, artificial intelligence, consortia of microbes, genome editing technology, and high-throughput culturing present many exciting opportunities for citrus microbiome research and microbial engineering to improve citrus health and productivity.

AB Personalized location prediction is key to many mobile applications and services. In this paper, motivated by both statistical and visualized preliminary analysis on three real datasets, we observe a strong spatiotemporal correlation for user trajectories among the visited area-of-interests (AoIs) and different time periods on both weekly and daily basis, which directly motivates our time-aware location prediction model design called "t-LocPred". It models the spatial correlations among AoIs by coarse-grained convolutional processing of the user trajectories in AoIs of different time periods ("ConvAoI"); and predicts his/her fine-grained next visited PoI using a novel memory-augmented attentive LSTM model ("mem-attLSTM") to capture long-term behavior patterns. Experimental results show that t-LocPred outperforms 8 baselines. We also show the impact of hyperparameters and the benefits ConvAoI can bring to these baselines.

AB Small-world networks provide an excellent balance of efficiency and robustness that is not available with other network topologies. These characteristics are exhibited in the Memristive Nanowire Neural Network (MN3), a novel neuromorphic hardware architecture. This architecture is composed of an electrode array connected by stochastically deposited core-shell nanowires. We simulate the stochastic behavior of the nanowires by making various assumptions on their paths. First, we assume that the nanowires follow straight paths. Next, we assume that they follow arc paths with varying radii. Last, we assume that they follow paths generated by pink noise. For each of the three methods, we present a method to find whether a nanowire passes over an electrode, allowing us to represent the architecture as a bipartite graph. We find that the small-worldness coefficient increases logarithmically and is consistently greater than one, which is indicative of a small-world network. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID DESIGN OPTIMIZATION; FLOW
AB There is growing interest to adopt supersonic turbines for rocket propulsion, However, this technology has not been actively investigated in the United States for the last three decades. To aid design improvement, a global optimization framework combining the radial-basis neural network (NN) and the polynomial response surface (RS) method is constructed for shape optimization of a two-stage supersonic turbine, involving O(10) design variables. The design of the experiment approach is adopted to reduce the data size needed by the optimization task. The combined NN and RS techniques are employed. A major merit of the RS approach is that it enables one to revise the design space to perform multiple optimization cycles. This benefit is realized when an optimal design approaches the boundary of a predefined design space. Furthermore, by inspecting the influence of each design variable, one can also gain insight into the existence of multiple design choices and select the optimum design based on other factors such as stress and materials consideration.

AB Polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs) are a family of materials with potential to be effective and scalable solutions for challenging adsorbent and membrane applications. The broad range of repeat unit chemistry, microporous structural features, and polymer processing makes exploration of the expansive PIM design space inefficient via chemical and materials intuition alone. Computational techniques such as molecular simulations and machine learning can provide a leap in capabilities to address this polymer design challenge and will be central to the future development of PIMs. We highlight recent microporous material studies that arrived at key results by employing computational techniques and provide our perspective on the prospects for in silico design and development of PIMs.

AB Background: One goal of structural biology is to understand how a protein's 3-dimensional conformation determines its capacity to interact with potential ligands. In the case of small chemical ligands, deconstructing a static protein-ligand complex into its constituent atom-atom interactions is typically sufficient to rapidly predict ligand affinity with high accuracy (>70% correlation between predicted and experimentally-determined affinity), a fact that is exploited to support structure-based drug design. We recently found that protein-DNA/RNA affinity can also be predicted with high accuracy using extensions of existing techniques, but protein-protein affinity could not be predicted with >60% correlation, even when the protein-protein complex was available.
   Methods: X-ray and NMR structures of protein-protein complexes, their associated binding affinities and experimental conditions were obtained from different binding affinity and structural databases. Statistical models were implemented using a generalized linear model framework, including the experimental conditions as new model features. We evaluated the potential for new features to improve affinity prediction models by calculating the Pearson correlation between predicted and experimental binding affinities on the training and test data after model fitting and after cross-validation. Differences in accuracy were assessed using two-sample t test and nonparametric Mann-Whitney U test.
   Results: Here we evaluate a range of potential factors that may interfere with accurate protein-protein affinity prediction. We find that X-ray crystal resolution has the strongest single effect on protein-protein affinity prediction. Limiting our analyses to only high-resolution complexes (= 2.5 angstrom) increased the correlation between predicted and experimental affinity from 54 to 68% (p = 4.32x10(-3)). In addition, incorporating information on the experimental conditions under which affinities were measured (pH, temperature and binding assay) had significant effects on prediction accuracy. We also highlight a number of potential errors in large structure-affinity databases, which could affect both model training and accuracy assessment.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that the accuracy of statistical models for protein-protein affinity prediction may be limited by the information present in databases used to train new models. Improving our capacity to integrate large-scale structural and functional information may be required to substantively advance our understanding of the general principles by which a protein's structure determines its function.

AB Tissue clearing of whole intact organs has enhanced imaging by enabling the exploration of tissue structure at a subcellular level in three-dimensional space. Although clearing and imaging of the whole organ have been used to study tissue biology, the microenvironment in which cells evolve to adapt to biomaterial implants or allografts in the body is poorly understood. Obtaining high-resolution information from complex cell-biomaterial interactions with volumetric landscapes represents a key challenge in the fields of biomaterials and regenerative medicine. To provide a new approach to examine how tissue responds to biomaterial implants, we apply cleared tissue light-sheet microscopy and three-dimensional reconstruction to utilize the wealth of autofluorescence information for visualizing and contrasting anatomical structures. This study demonstrates the adaptability of the clearing and imaging technique to provide sub-cellular resolution (0.6 mu m isotropic) 3D maps of various tissue types, using samples from fully intact peritoneal organs to volumetric muscle loss injury specimens. Specifically, in the volumetric muscle loss injury model, we provide 3D visualization of the implanted extracellular matrix biomaterial in the wound bed of the quadricep muscle groups and further apply computational-driven image classification to analyze the autofluorescence spectrum at multiple emission wavelengths to categorize tissue types at the injured site interacting with the biomaterial scaffolds.

AB Terahertz radiation for inspection and fault detection has been of interest for the semiconductor industry since the first generation and detection of THz signals. Until recent hardware advances, THz systems lacked the signal quality and reliability for use as an effective nondestructive testing (NDT) method. Incremental advances in THz sources, detectors, and signal processing resulted in the successful applied-industrial use of THz NDT techniques on carbon fiber laminates, automotive coatings, and for detection of counterfeit pharmaceutical tablets. Semiconductor inspection and verification methods ensure the functionality and thereby safety of vital electronics for several critical industries. For this reason, the reliability and verification of a THz NDT method must exceed currently used inspection systems. With recent laboratory access to THz radiation, THz inspection methods are often compared with existing optical, electrical, and volumetric semiconductor verification techniques for their production monitoring and failure analysis viability. This review will cover THz techniques and their applications at the printed circuit board (PCB), integrated circuit (IC), and transistor/gate scales. The THz radiation gap spans between optical and electronic ranges with a millimeter-sized wavelength allowing for adequate penetration of plastic and ceramic and semiconductor materials. THz radiation can be used to determine structural features, electrical signatures in the THz range, and chemical information simultaneously. Cost and environmental limitations restricted the ability for THz NDT semiconductor inspection methods to escape the lab and succeed in the dynamic environment of a semiconductor fabrication environment. Hybridized metrology methods incorporating information from multiple inspection tools are a regime where THz spectral and structural data can be combined with existing methods such as optical, x-ray, or E-beam. THz can be used initially to offer support to the complex failure analysis and verification requirements of the semiconductor industry from nanoscale to macroscale features and components. For THz systems to become independent inspection tools used for semiconductor production monitoring, in the lab or fab, this will require a confident level of statistical process control for THz signal generation, detection, or processing. Applied industrial semiconductor device inspection will likely be a result of a combination of research into THz hardware, reconstruction techniques, and the widespread application of machine learning techniques. Many breakthroughs occurred over the years to enable successful nondestructive characterization and inspection of semiconductor devices from the nanoscale transistors to fully packaged integrated circuits and assembled PCBs.

ID DEFENSE
AB In recent years, distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks have become a major security threat to Internet services. How to detect and defend against DDoS attacks is currently a hot topic in both industry and academia. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to robustly and efficiently detect DDoS attacks and identify attack packets. The key idea of L our framework is to exploit spatial and temporal correlation of DDoS attack traffic. In this framework, we design a perimeter-based anti-DDoS system, in which traffic is analyzed only at the edge routers of an internet service provider (ISP) network. Our framework is able to detect any source-address-spoofed DDoS attack, no matter whether it is a low-volume attack or a high-volume attack. The novelties of our framework are (1) temporal-correlation based feature extraction and (2) spatial-correlation based detection. With these techniques, our scheme can accurately detect DDoS attacks and identify attack packets without modifying existing IP forwarding mechanisms at routers. Our simulation results show that the proposed framework can detect DDoS attacks even if the volume of attack traffic on each link is extremely small. Especially, for the same false alarm probability, our scheme has a detection probability of 0.97, while the existing scheme has a detection probability of 0.17, which demonstrates the superior performance of our scheme.

AB Introduction Traditionally, the study of aphasia focused on brain trauma, clinical biomarkers, and cognitive processes, rarely considering the social determinants of health. This study evaluates the relationship between aphasia impairment and demographic, socioeconomic, and contextual determinants among people with aphasia (PWA).Methods PWA indexed within AphasiaBank-a database populated by multiple clinical aphasiology centers with standardized protocols characterizing language, neuropsychological functioning, and demographic information-were matched with respondents in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey based on response year, age, sex, race, ethnicity, time post stroke, and mental health status. Generalized log-linear regression models with bootstrapped standard errors evaluated the association between scores on the Western Aphasia Battery-Revised Aphasia Quotient (WAB-R AQ) and demographic, economic, and contextual characteristics accounting for clustering of respondents and the stratification of data collection. Region, age, and income specific models tested the sensitivity of results.Results PWA over age 60 had 2.4% (SE = 0.020) lower WAB-R AQ scores compared with younger PWA. Compared to White PWA, Black and Hispanic PWA had 4.7% (SE = 0.03) and 0.81% (SE = 0.06) lower WAB-R AQ scores, respectively, as did those and living in the Southern US (-2.2%, SE = 0.03) even after controlling for age, family size, and aphasia type. Those living in larger families (beta = 0.005, SE = 0.008), with income over $30,000 (beta = 0.017, SE = 0.022), and a college degree (beta = 0.030, SE = 0.035) had higher WAB-R AQ relative to their counterparts. Region-specific models showed that racial differences were only significant in the South and Midwest, while ethnic differences are only significant in the West. Sex differences only appeared in age-specific models. Racial and ethnic differences were not significant in the high-income group regression.Conclusion These findings support evidence that circumstances in which individuals live, work, and age are significantly associated with their health outcomes including aphasia impairment.

AB Accurate information on, and human interpretation of, urban land cover using satellite-derived sensor imagery is critical given the intricate nature and niches of socioeconomic, demographic, and environmental factors occurring at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Detailed knowledge of urban land and their changing pattern over time periods associated with ecological risk is, however, required for the best use of critical land and its environmental resources. Interest in this topic has increased recently, driven by a surge in the use of open-source computing software, satellite-derived imagery, and improved classification algorithms. Using the machine learning algorithm Random Forest, combined with multi-date Landsat imagery, we classified eight periods of land cover maps with up-to-date spatial and temporal information of urban land between the period of 1972 and 2015 for the mega-urban region of greater Dhaka in Bangladesh. Random Foresta non-parametric ensemble classifier-has shown a quantum increase in satellite-derived image classification accuracy due to its outperformance over traditional approaches, e.g., Maximum Likelihood. Employing Random Forest as an image classification approach for this study with independent cross-validation techniques, we obtained high classification accuracy, user and producer accuracy. Our overall classification accuracy ranges were between 85% and 97% with kappa values between 0.81 and 0.94. The area statistics derived from the thematic land cover map show that the built-up area in the 43-year study period expanded quickly, from 35 km(2) in 1972 to 378 km(2) in 2015, with a net increase rate of approximately 980% and an average annual growth rate of 6%. This growth rate, however, was higher in peripheral areas, with a 2903% increase and an annual expansion rate of 8%, compared to a 460% increase with an annual growth rate of 4% in the core city area (Dhaka City Corporation). This huge urban expansion took place in the north, northwest, and southwest regions of Dhaka, transforming areas that were previously agricultural land, vegetation cover, wetland, and water bodies. The main factors driving the city towards northern corridors include flood-free higher land, the availability of a transportation network, and the agglomeration of manufacturing-based employment centers. The resulting thematic map and spatial information produced from this study therefore serve to facilitate a detailed understanding of urban growth dynamics and land cover change patterns in the mega-urban region of Dhaka, Bangladesh.

AB The application of data-driven time series analysis techniques such as Granger causality, partial directed coherence and phase dynamics modeling to estimate effective connectivity in brain networks has recently gained significant prominence in the neuroscience community. While these techniques have been useful in determining causal interactions among different regions of brain networks, a thorough analysis of the comparative accuracy and robustness of these methods in identifying patterns of effective connectivity among brain networks is still lacking. In this paper, we systematically address this issue within the context of simple networks of coupled spiking neurons. Specifically, we develop a method to assess the ability of various effective connectivity measures to accurately determine the true effective connectivity of a given neuronal network. Our method is based on decision tree classifiers which are trained using several time series features that can be observed solely from experimentally recorded data. We show that the classifiers constructed in this work provide a general framework for determining whether a particular effective connectivity measure is likely to produce incorrect results when applied to a dataset.

AB A central problem in de novo drug design is determining the binding affinity of a ligand with a receptor. A new scoring algorithm is presented that estimates the binding affinity of a protein-ligand complex given a three-dimensional structure. The method, LISA (Ligand Identification Scoring Algorithm), uses an empirical scoring function to describe the binding free energy. Interaction terms have been designed to account for van der Waals (VDW) contacts, hydrogen bonding, desolvation effects, and metal chelation to model the dissociation equilibrium constants using a linear model. Atom types have been introduced to differentiate the parameters for VDW, H-bonding interactions, and metal chelation between different atom pairs. A training set of 492 protein-ligand complexes was selected for the fitting process. Different test sets have been examined to evaluate its ability to predict experimentally measured binding affinities. By comparing with other well-known scoring functions, the results show that LISA has advantages over many existing scoring functions in simulating protein ligand binding affinity, especially metalloprotein-ligand binding affinity. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was also used in order to demonstrate that the energy terms in LISA are well designed and do not require extra cross terms.

AB Data-driven computational neural network models have been used to study mechanisms for generating the motor patterns for breathing and breathing related behaviors such as coughing. These models have commonly been evaluated in open loop conditions or with feedback of lung volume simply represented as a filtered version of phrenic motor output. Limitations of these approaches preclude assessment of the influence of mechanical properties of the musculoskeletal system and motivated development of a biomechanical model of the respiratory muscles, airway, and lungs using published measures from human subjects. Here we describe the model and some aspects of its behavior when linked to a computational brainstem respiratory network model for breathing and airway defensive behavior composed of discrete "integrate and fire" populations. The network incorporated multiple circuit paths and operations for tuning inspiratory drive suggested by prior work. Results from neuromechanical system simulations included generation of a eupneic-like breathing pattern and the observation that increased respiratory drive and operating volume result in higher peak flow rates during cough, even when the expiratory drive is unchanged, or when the expiratory abdominal pressure is unchanged. Sequential elimination of the model's sources of inspiratory drive during cough also suggested a role for disinhibitory regulation via tonic expiratory neurons, a result that was subsequently supported by an analysis of in vivo data. Comparisons with antecedent models, discrepancies with experimental results, and some model limitations are noted.

AB Tensor regression models are of emerging interest in diverse fields of social and behavioral sciences, including neuroimaging analysis, neural networks, image processing and so on. Recent theoretical advancements of tensor decomposition have facilitated significant development of various tensor regression models. The focus of most of the available literature has been on the Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition and its variants for the regression coefficient tensor. A CP decomposed coefficient tensor enables estimation with relatively small sample size, but it may not always capture the underlying complex structure in the data. In this work, we leverage the recently developed concept of tubal rank and develop a tensor regression model, wherein the coefficient tensor is decomposed into two components: a low tubal rank tensor and a structured sparse one. We first address the issue of identifiability of the two components comprising the coefficient tensor and subsequently develop a fast and scalable Alternating Minimization algorithm to solve the convex regularized program. Further, we provide finite sample error bounds under high dimensional scaling for the model parameters.

AB Liquid-microjunction surface sampling (LMJ-SS) is an ambient ionization technique based on the continuous flow of solvent using an in situ microextraction device in which solvent moves through the probe, drawing in the analytes in preparation for ionization using an electrospray ionization source. However, unlike traditional mass spectrometry (MS) techniques, it operates under ambient pressure and requires no sample preparation, thereby making it ideal for rapid sampling of thicker tissue sections for electrophysiological and other neuroscientific research studies. Studies interrogating neural synapses, or a specific neural circuit, typically employ thick, ex vivo tissue sections maintained under near-physiological conditions to preserve tissue viability and maintain the neural networks. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a surgical procedure used to treat the neurological symptoms that are associated with certain neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases. Parkinsons disease (PD) is a neurological disorder which is commonly treated with DBS therapy. PD is characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta portion of the brain. Here, we demonstrate that the LMJ-SS methodology can provide a platform for ex vivo analysis of the brain during electrical stimulation, such as DBS. We employ LMJ-SS in the ex vivo analysis of mouse brain tissue for monitoring dopamine during electrical stimulation of the striatum region. The mouse brain tissue was sectioned fresh post sacrifice and maintained in artificial cerebrospinal fluid to create near-physiological conditions before direct sampling using LMJ-SS. A selection of metabolites, including time-sensitive metabolites involved in energy regulation in the brain, were identified using standards, and the mass spectral database mzCloud was used to assess the feasibility of the methodology. Thereafter, the intensity of m/z 154 corresponding to protonated dopamine was monitored before and after electrical stimulation of the striatum region, showing an increase in signal directly following a stimulation event. Dopamine is the key neurotransmitter implicated in PD, and although electrochemical detectors have shown such increases in dopamine post-DBS, this is the first study to do so using MS methodologies.

AB Most existing perception systems rely on sensory data acquired from cameras, which perform poorly in low light and adverse weather conditions. To resolve this limitation, we have witnessed advanced LiDAR sensors become popular in perception tasks in autonomous driving applications. Nevertheless, their usage in traffic monitoring systems is less ubiquitous. We identify two significant obstacles in cost-effectively and efficiently developing such a LiDAR-based traffic monitoring system: (i) public LiDAR datasets are insufficient for supporting perception tasks in infrastructure systems, and (ii) 3D annotations on LiDAR point clouds are time-consuming and expensive. To fill this gap, we present an efficient semi-automated annotation tool that automatically annotates LiDAR sequences with tracking algorithms while offering a fully annotated infrastructure LiDAR dataset-FLORIDA (Florida LiDAR-based Object Recognition and Intelligent Data Annotation)-which will be made publicly available. Our advanced annotation tool seamlessly integrates multi-object tracking (MOT), single-object tracking (SOT), and suitable trajectory post-processing techniques. Specifically, we introduce a human-in-the-loop schema in which annotators recursively fix and refine annotations imperfectly predicted by our tool and incrementally add them to the training dataset to obtain better SOT and MOT models. By repeating the process, we significantly increase the overall annotation speed by 3 - 4 times and obtain better qualitative annotations than a state-of-the-art annotation tool. The human annotation experiments verify the effectiveness of our annotation tool. In addition, we provide detailed statistics and object detection evaluation results for our dataset in serving as a benchmark for perception tasks at traffic intersections.

AB Background Neural connectome theory has been widely used in system neuroscience, and prompted our comprehension for the topological organizations of human cerebral cortex. However, how functional connectome is organized topologically in cerebellums remains unclear. Method Resting-state functional connectivity (rs-fcMRI) data were acquired from 1416 healthy adults in two independent samples. In Sample 1 ( n = 976), both voxel-wise and node-wise topological properties for functional cerebellar connectome were estimated. Moreover, the network-based topological properties of cerebellum and cerebro-cerebellar topological mapping were investigated, respectively. Given the temporal natures in the neural population, a hidden Markov model (HMM) was further capitalized to uncover the dynamic pattern of cerebellar functional connectome. In order to test the robustness of our findings, we ran all of the analyses in an independent dataset (Sample 2; n = 440). Results We found that Crus I and II exhibited prominently high degree centrality (DC) for cerebellar functional connectome. Further, the cerebellar functional connectome and even the nested network-wise cerebellar connectome was found to be organized by small-world, modular and hierarchical manners significantly. Also, three intrinsic modules were found in cerebellar functional connectome, including attention/executive network, default mode network and task-positive network. In addition, the significant cerebro-cerebellar correlations for small-world organization and hierarchical architecture were found as well. By building cerebro-cerebellar topological mapping, both frontoparietal and subcortical networks were found to be overrepresented into cerebellums than cerebral cortex (3-fold). As for temporal natures, cerebellar functional connectome was observed to be highly flexible and modular, but showed high individual-specific variances in temporal dynamic pattern. Conclusion This study identified the topological architectures and temporal hierarchy of functional cerebellar connectome, and further demonstrated prominent functional cerebro-cerebellar couplings of small-world organization and hierarchical architectures.

ID NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION; LAND-COVER; CLASSIFICATION; NDVI; CHLOROPHYLL
AB Leaf Area Index (LAI) is an important biophysical characteristic of vegetation that is directly related to rates of atmospheric gas exchange, biomass partitioning, and productivity. Mapping and monitoring LAI over scales from landscapes to regions is essential for understanding medium-scale biophysical properties and how these properties affect biogeochemical cycling, biomass accumulation, and primary productivity. This study developed and verified several models to estimate LAI using in situ field measurements, Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery, vegetation indices, simple and multiple regression, and artificial neural networks (ANNs). It was shown that while multiple band regression and regression with individual vegetation indices can estimate LAI, the most accurate way to estimate regional scale LAI is to train an ANN using in situ LAI data and remote sensing brightness values.

AB Objective: Social determinants of health (SDoH) are nonclinical dispositions that impact patient health risks and clinical outcomes. Leveraging SDoH in clinical decision-making can potentially improve diagnosis, treatment planning, and patient outcomes. Despite increased interest in capturing SDoH in electronic health records (EHRs), such information is typically locked in unstructured clinical notes. Natural language processing (NLP) is the key technology to extract SDoH information from clinical text and expand its utility in patient care and research. This article presents a systematic review of the state-of-the-art NLP approaches and tools that focus on identifying and extracting SDoH data from unstructured clinical text in EHRs.
   Materials and Methods: A broad literature search was conducted in February 2021 using 3 scholarly databases (ACL Anthology, PubMed, and Scopus) following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 6402 publications were initially identified, and after applying the study inclusion criteria, 82 publications were selected for the final review.
   Results: Smoking status (n=27), substance use (n=21), homelessness (n=20), and alcohol use (n=15) are the most frequently studied SDoH categories. Homelessness (n=7) and other less-studied SDoH (eg, education, financial problems, social isolation and support, family problems) are mostly identified using rule-based approaches. In contrast, machine learning approaches are popular for identifying smoking status (n=13), substance use (n=9), and alcohol use (n=9).
   Conclusion: NLP offers significant potential to extract SDoH data from narrative clinical notes, which in turn can aid in the development of screening tools, risk prediction models, and clinical decision support systems.

DE Recommendation system; Contrastive learning; Graph Neural Network
AB Collaborative filtering methods based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained increasing popularity in recommendation systems. These methods enhance the representation of users and items by leveraging the information of graph structure from interaction data, improving recommendation performance. However, they often face limitations due to the data sparsity issue that is common in recommendation systems. In the constructed user-item heterogeneous bipartite graph, sparse interaction data leads to a scarcity of neighbor nodes impeding the acquisition of sufficient collaborative signals via the message-passing mechanism among these neighbor nodes. We have observed that users and items can be grouped according to characteristic similarities. These groups' common feature information can serve as supplementary data to aid in the embedding learning. So, we present the Heterogeneous Collaborative Filtering Contrastive Learning (HCFCL) method, which aims to extract two types of heterogeneous collaborative signals from interaction data: those based on neighbor nodes and those based on group features. Specifically, we design an embedding generative hypergraph network to extract group common feature information founded on the heterogeneous bipartite graph. The group common feature information is transferred via a meta network and personalized bridge functions according to individual characteristics. Additionally, the HCFCL model, combined with contrastive learning, captures the consistency of the heterogeneous collaborative signals to enhance representation. The experiment demonstrates the superior performance of the HCFCL model compared to other methods evaluated on three public datasets, demonstrating excellent and stable performance in mitigating the data sparsity issue.

ID DESIGN OPTIMIZATION
AB The custom in surrogate-based modeling of complex engineering problems is to fit one or more surrogate models and select the one surrogate model that performs best. In this paper, we extend the utility of an ensemble of surrogates to (1) identify regions of possible high errors at locations where predictions of surrogates widely differ, and (2) provide a more robust approximation approach. We explore the possibility of using the best surrogate or a weighted average surrogate model instead of individual surrogate models. The weights associated with each surrogate model are determined based on the errors in surrogates. We demonstrate the advantages of an ensemble of surrogates using analytical problems and one engineering problem. We show that for a single problem the choice of test surrogate can depend on the design of experiments.

TI Augmented breath phase volume and timing relationships in the
   anesthetized rat
SO NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS
LA English
DT Article
DE phrenic; sighs; breathing
AB Augmented breaths (ABs), or sighs, are airway protective reflexes and part of the normal repertoire of respiratory behaviors. ABs consist of two phases, where phase I volume and timing resembles preceding eupnic breaths. and phase II is an augmenting motor pattern and occurs at the end of phase I. Recent evidence suggest multiple respiratory motor patterns can occur following dynamic functional reconfiguration of one respiratory neural network. It follows that the response of the respiraton, network to modulatory inputs also may undergo dynamic reconfiguration. We hypothesized that lung-volume related feedback during ABs would alter AB timing differentially during phase I and II. We measured phase I and II volumes and durations in urethane anesthetized rats with decreased lung volume secondary to three models of varying phrenic motor impairment (spinal injury alone. unilateral phrenicotomy. and combined in juries). AB phase I and II inspired volume, were decreased after phrenic motor inpairment (p < 0.05). In contrast. only phase I duration following injury was altered compared to controls, Phase II duration remaining unchanged despite the greatest effect of injury on volume occurring during phase II. Thus, sigh volume-timing relationships differ between phases of an augmented breath suggesting that the response of the respiratory network to modulatory inputs has changed. These data support the hypothesis that multiple respiratory behaviors occur following dynamic reconfiguration of the respiratory neural network. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A magnetoelectric antenna (ME) can exhibit the dual capabilities of wireless energy harvesting and sensing at different frequencies. In this article, a behavioral circuit model for hybrid ME antennas is described to emulate the radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting and sensing operations during circuit simulations. The ME antenna of this work is interfaced with a CMOS energy harvester chip towards the goal of developing a wireless communication link for fully integrated implantable devices. One role of the integrated system is to receive pulse-modulated power from a nearby transmitter, and another role is to sense and transmit low-magnitude neural signals. The measurements reported in this paper are the first results that demonstrate simultaneous low-frequency wireless magnetic sensing and high-frequency wireless energy harvesting at two different frequencies with one dual-mode ME antenna. The proposed behavioral ME antenna model can be utilized during design optimizations of energy harvesting circuits. Measurements were performed to validate the wireless power transfer link with an ME antenna having a 2.57 GHz resonance frequency connected to an energy harvester chip designed in 65nm CMOS technology. Furthermore, this dual-mode ME antenna enables concurrent sensing using a carrier signal with a frequency that matches the second 63.63 MHz resonance mode. A wireless test platform has been developed for evaluation of ME antennas as a tool for neural implant design, and this prototype system was utilized to provide first experimental results with the transmission of magnetically modulated action potential waveforms.

AB Acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) and task-specific training (TST) synergistically improve motor function after spinal cord injury; however, mechanisms underlying this synergistic relation are unknown. We propose a hypothetical working model of neural network and cellular elements to explain AIH-TST synergy. Our goal is to forecast experiments necessary to advance our understanding and optimize the neurotherapeutic potential of AIH-TST.

AB The adoption of dicamba-tolerant (DT) soybean in the United States resulted in extensive off-target dicamba damage to non-DT vegetation across soybean-producing states. Although soybeans are highly sensitive to dicamba, the intensity of observed symptoms and yield losses are affected by the genetic background of genotypes. Thus, the objective of this study was to detect novel marker-trait associations and expand on previously identified genomic regions related to soybean response to off-target dicamba. A total of 551 non-DT advanced breeding lines derived from 232 unique bi-parental populations were phenotyped for off-target dicamba across nine environments for three years. Breeding lines were genotyped using the Illumina Infinium BARCSoySNP6K BeadChip. Filtered SNPs were included as predictors in Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models in a forward stepwise selection loop to identify the combination of SNPs yielding the highest classification accuracy. Both RF and SVM models yielded high classification accuracies (0.76 and 0.79, respectively) with minor extreme misclassifications (observed tolerant predicted as susceptible, and vice-versa). Eight genomic regions associated with off-target dicamba tolerance were identified on chromosomes 6 [Linkage Group (LG) C2], 8 (LG A2), 9 (LG K), 10 (LG O), and 19 (LG L). Although the genetic architecture of tolerance is complex, high classification accuracies were obtained when including the major effect SNP identified on chromosome 6 as the sole predictor. In addition, candidate genes with annotated functions associated with phases II (conjugation of hydroxylated herbicides to endogenous sugar molecules) and III (transportation of herbicide conjugates into the vacuole) of herbicide detoxification in plants were co-localized with significant markers within each genomic region. Genomic prediction models, as reported in this study, can greatly facilitate the identification of genotypes with superior tolerance to off-target dicamba.

AB Respiratory interoception is one of the internal bodily systems that is comprised of different types of somatic and visceral sensations elicited by different patterns of afferent input and respiratory motor drive mediating multiple respiratory modalities. Respiratory interoception is a complex system, having multiple afferents grouped into afferent clusters and projecting into both discriminative and affective centers that are directly related to the behavioral assessment of breathing. The multi -afferent system provides a spectrum of input that result in the ability to interpret the different types of respiratory interceptive sensations. This can result in a response, commonly reported as breathlessness or dyspnea. Dyspnea can be differentiated into specific modalities. These respiratory sensory modalities lead to a general sensation of an Urge -to -Breathe, driven by a need to compensate for the modulation of ventilation that has occurred due to factors that have affected breathing. The multiafferent system for respiratory interoception can also lead to interpretation of the sensory signals resulting in respiratory related sensory experiences, including the Urge -to -Cough and Urge -to -Swallow. These behaviors are modalities that can be driven through the differentiation and integration of multiple afferent input into the respiratory neural comparator. Respiratory sensations require neural somatic and visceral interoceptive elements that include gated attention and detection leading to respiratory modality discrimination with subsequent cognitive decision and behavioral compensation. Studies of brain areas mediating cortical and subcortical respiratory sensory pathways are summarized and used to develop a model of an integrated respiratory neural network mediating respiratory interoception.

AB PURPOSEA combination of fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) is the standard for adjuvant therapy of resected early-stage colon cancer (CC). Oxaliplatin leads to lasting and disabling neurotoxicity. Reserving the regimen for patients who benefit from oxaliplatin would maximize efficacy and minimize unnecessary adverse side effects.METHODSWe trained a new machine learning model, referred to as the colon oxaliplatin signature (COLOXIS) model, for predicting response to oxaliplatin-containing regimens. We examined whether COLOXIS was predictive of oxaliplatin benefits in the CC adjuvant setting among 1,065 patients treated with 5-fluorouracil plus leucovorin (FULV; n = 421) or FULV + oxaliplatin (FOLFOX; n = 644) from NSABP C-07 and C-08 phase III trials. The COLOXIS model dichotomizes patients into COLOXIS+ (oxaliplatin responder) and COLOXIS- (nonresponder) groups. Eight-year recurrence-free survival was used to evaluate oxaliplatin benefits within each of the groups, and the predictive value of the COLOXIS model was assessed using the P value associated with the interaction term (int P) between the model prediction and the treatment effect.RESULTSAmong 1,065 patients, 526 were predicted as COLOXIS+ and 539 as COLOXIS-. The COLOXIS+ prediction was associated with prognosis for FULV-treated patients (hazard ratio [HR], 1.52 [95% CI, 1.07 to 2.15]; P = .017). The model was predictive of oxaliplatin benefits: COLOXIS+ patients benefited from oxaliplatin (HR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.48 to 0.89]; P = .0065; int P = .03), but COLOXIS- patients did not (COLOXIS- HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.77 to 1.52]; P = .65).CONCLUSIONThe COLOXIS model is predictive of oxaliplatin benefits in the CC adjuvant setting. The results provide evidence supporting a change in CC adjuvant therapy: reserve oxaliplatin only for COLOXIS+ patients, but further investigation is warranted.

AB It has become widely appreciated that the spinal cord has significant neuroplastic potential, is not hard-wired, and that with traumatic injury and anatomical plasticity, the networks that we once understood now comprise a new anatomy. Harnessing advances in neuroanatomical tracing to map the neuronal networks of the intact and injured spinal cord has been crucial to elucidating this new spinal cord anatomy. Many new techniques have been developed to identify these networks using a variety of retrograde and anterograde tracers. One method of tracing that has become more widely used to map anatomical changes is transneuronal tracing. Viral tracers are being increasingly used to map spinal networks, leading to an advanced understanding of spinal circuitry and host-donor-host interactions between the injured spinal cord and neural transplants. This review will highlight advances in neuronal tracing, specifically using pseudorabies virus (PRV), and its use in the intact, injured, and transplanted spinal cord.

ID AUTOMATIC RECONSTRUCTION; INTERIORS; STATE
AB Recent advances in laser scanning systems have enabled the acquisition of 3D point cloud representations of scenes, revolutionizing the fields of Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC). This paper presents a novel pipeline for the automatic generation of 3D semantic models of multi-level buildings from indoor point clouds. The architectural components are extracted hierarchically. After segmenting the point clouds into potential building floors, a wall detection process is performed on each floor segment. Then, room, ground, and ceiling extraction are conducted using the walls 2D constellation obtained from the projection of the walls onto the ground plan. The identification of the openings in the walls is performed using a deep learning-based classifier that separates doors and windows from non-consistent holes. Based on the geometric and semantic information from previously detected elements, the final model is generated in IFC format. The effectiveness and reliability of the proposed pipeline are demonstrated through extensive experiments and visual inspections. The results reveal high precision and recall values in the extraction of architectural elements, ensuring the fidelity of the generated models. In addition, the pipeline's efficiency and accuracy offer valuable contributions to future advancements in point cloud processing.

AB Objective: In this study, we performed a classification tree analysis (CTA) to identify population subgroups that are less likely to have an oral cancer examination (OCE). Methods: We conducted telephone surveys (N = 2401) of adults residing in north Florida to collect data on OCE status and potential OCE predictors including demographics, medical and dental experience, and psychosocial factors. The CTA algorithm exhaustive chi-square automatic interaction detector (E-CHAID) was employed to determine the relationships between OCE status and the predictors. Results: The overall OCE rate was 46.8% in our sample. Participants' rating of the dentist was the first level splitting variable, leading to 15 unique participant subgroups: (1) high dentist rating (N = 1269) led to 5 splits and 11 subgroups; (2) low dentist rating (N = 308) led to zero splits; and (3) no regular dentist (N = 824) led to 2 splits and 3 subgroups. Conclusions: The CTA has identified unique population subgroups that could be targeted in future tailored public health interventions. Among underserved populations, it is important to develop and implement community-based interventions that encourage regular dental visits and provide oral cancer self-examination education..

TI Utilizing Gaussian mixture models in all-sky searches for short-duration
   gravitational wave bursts
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
LA English
DT Article
ID CORE-COLLAPSE; COALESCENCE
AB Coherent WaveBurst is a generic, multidetector gravitational wave burst search based on the excess power approach. The coherent WaveBurst algorithm currently employed in the all-sky short-duration gravitational wave burst search uses a conditional approach on selected attributes in the multidimensional event attribute space to distinguish between noisy events from that of astrophysical origin. We have been developing a supervised machine learning approach based on the Gaussian mixture modeling to model the attribute space for signals as well as noise events to enhance the probability of burst detection [Gayathri et al.Phys. Rev. D 102, 104023 (2020)]. We further extend the Gaussian mixture model approach to the allsky short-duration coherent WaveBurst search as a postprocessing step on events from the first half of the third observing run (O3a). We show an improvement in sensitivity to generic gravitational wave burst signal morphologies as well as the astrophysical source such as core-collapse supernova models due to the application of our Gaussian mixture model approach to coherent WaveBurst triggers. The Gaussian mixture model method recovers the gravitational wave signals from massive compact binary coalescences identified by coherent WaveBurst targeted for binary black holes in GWTC-2, with better significance than the all-sky coherent WaveBurst search. No additional significant gravitational wave bursts are observed.

ID DESIGN
AB The knowledge of thermodynamic properties for novel electrolyte formulations is of fundamental interest for industrial applications as well as academic research. Herewith, we present an artificial neural networks (ANN) approach for the prediction of solvation energies and entropies for distinct ion pairs in various protic and aprotic solvents. The considered feed-forward ANN is trained either by experimental data or computational results from conceptual density functional theory calculations. The proposed concept of mapping computed values to experimental data lowers the amount of time-consuming and costly experiments and helps to overcome certain limitations. Our findings reveal high correlation coefficients between predicted and experimental values which demonstrate the validity of our approach.

TI Enhancing the sensitivity of transient gravitational wave searches with
   Gaussian mixture models
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
LA English
DT Article
AB Identifying the presence of a gravitational wave transient buried in nonstationary, non-Gaussian noise, which can often contain spurious noise transients (glitches), is a very challenging task. For a given dataset, transient gravitational wave searches produce a corresponding list of triggers that indicate the possible presence of a gravitational wave signal. These triggers are often the result of glitches mimicking gravitational wave signal characteristics. To distinguish glitches from genuine gravitational wave signals, search algorithms estimate a range of trigger attributes, with thresholds applied to these trigger properties to separate signal from noise. Here, we present the use of Gaussian mixture models, a supervised machine learning approach, as a means of modeling the multidimensional trigger attribute space. We demonstrate this approach by applying it to triggers from the coherent Waveburst search for generic bursts in LIGO O1 data. By building Gaussian mixture models for the signal and background noise attribute spaces, we show that we can significantly improve the sensitivity of the coherent Waveburst search and strongly suppress the impact of glitches and background noise, without the use of multiple search bins as employed by the original O1 search. We show that the detection probability is enhanced by a factor of 10, leading enhanced statistical significance for gravitational wave signals such as GW150914.

AB Frontal lobe-executive functions are heavily dependent on distal white matter connectivity. Even with healthy aging there is an increase in leukoaraiosis that might interrupt this connectivity. The goal of this study is to learn 1) the location, depth, and percentage of leukoaraiosis in white matter among a sample of non-demented older adults and 2) associations between these leukoarioasis metrics and composites of cognitive efficiency (processing speed, working memory, and inhibitory function), and episodic memory. Participants were 154 non-demented older adults (age range 60-85) who completed a brain MRI and neuropsychological testing on the same day. Brain MRIs were segmented via Freesurfer and white matter leukoaraiosis depth segmentations was based on published criteria. On average, leukoaraiosis occupied 1 % of total white matter. There was no difference in LA distribution in the frontal (1.12%), parietal (1.10%), and occipital (0.95%) lobes; there was less LA load within the temporal lobe (0.23%). For cortical depth, leukoaraiosis was predominantly in the periventricular region (3.39%; deep 1.46%, infracortical 0.15%). Only increasing frontal lobe and periventricular leukoaraiosis were associated with a reduction in processing speed, working memory, and inhibitory function. Despite the general presence of LA throughout the brain, only frontal and periventricular LA contributed to the speeded and mental manipulation of executive functioning. This study provides a normative description of LA for non-demented adults to use as a comparison to more disease samples.

AB Computer vision has emerged as a powerful tool to elevate behavioral research. This protocol describes a computer vision machine learning pipeline called AlphaTracker, which has minimal hardware requirements and produces reliable tracking of multiple unmarked animals, as well as behavioral clustering. AlphaTracker pairs a top-down pose-estimation software combined with unsupervised clustering to facilitate behavioral motif discovery that will accelerate behavioral research. All steps of the protocol are provided as open-source software with graphic user interfaces or implementable with command-line prompts. Users with a graphical processing unit (GPU) can model and analyze animal behaviors of interest in less than a day. AlphaTracker greatly facilitates the analysis of the mechanism of individual/social behavior and group dynamics.

AB The effects of practice on the discrimination of direction of motion in briefly presented noisy dynamic random dot patterns are investigated in several forced-choice psychophysical tasks. We found that the percentage of correct responses on any specific task increases linearly with repetition of trials within roughly 200 trials from about chance to a performance of 90% or better. The level of performance remained constant or improved over several days, and in most instances it did not transfer when stimulus parameters changed. We used a modified Radial Basis Function (RBF) representation to model the psychophysical tasks. The performance of the model is functionally similar to the psychophysical results. We propose a Hebbian learning algorithm which deactivates the inputs from neurons responding to motion noise in the stimulus. Our computational model suggests that to solve this task in biological systems, neurons (perhaps in MT) improve their performance by 'learning to ignore' noise in the image.

AB Blind separation of convolutive mixtures has many applications in the areas of acoustics, communications, biomedical signal processing. Spatio-temporal decorrelation is a useful preprocessing technique that can reduce the blind separation problem into a simpler orthogonal matrix estimation problem. However, it is computationally expensive for its large unknown parameter set. Realtime spatio-temporal decorrelation method remains an open issue for years. In this paper, we focus on accelerating the adaptation process in the FIR filter based decorrelation method. Firstly, the update equation is decoupled into spatial decorrelation and temporal decorrelation. Then, their respective convergence conditions are systematically analyzed using eigenvalue decomposing method. Based on it, a fast algorithm for FIR filter network with spatio-temporal decoupled adaptive step-sizes is proposed. Comprehensive simulations are performed on both synthetic data and real world captured sEMG data. We have compared the proposed algorithm with the fixed step size method, IIR filter with natural gradient, and the annealed step size method. The factors including number of iteration, number of channel, computational time, selection of filter order and window size are elaborately compared and discussed. The results verified the reliable performance of our method on accelerating the adaptation process for spatio-temporal decorrelation simultaneously compared to classical methods.

DT Article
DE Causal estimation; Robust prediction; Constrained optimization;
   Directional derivative; Interventional data
ID SELECTION; REPRESENTATION
AB This paper presents a new optimization approach to causal estimation. Given data that contains covariates and an outcome, which covariates are causes of the outcome, and what is the strength of the causality? In classical machine learning (ML), the goal of optimization is to maximize predictive accuracy. However, some covariates might exhibit a non-causal association with the outcome. Such spurious associations provide predictive power for classical ML, but they prevent us from causally interpreting the result. This paper proposes CoCo, an optimization algorithm that bridges the gap between pure prediction and causal inference. CoCo leverages the recently-proposed idea of environments (Peters et al., remain invariant but where the distribution of the covariates changes from environment to environment. Given datasets from multiple environments-and ones that exhibit sufficient heterogeneity-CoCo maximizes an objective for which the only solution is the causal solution. We describe the theoretical foundations of this approach and demonstrate its effectiveness on simulated and real datasets. Compared to classical ML and existing methods, CoCo provides more accurate estimates of the causal model and more accurate predictions under interventions.

AB Prognostics and health management (PHM) has become an essential function for safe system operation and scheduling economic maintenance. To date, there has been much research and publications on component-level prognostics. In practice, however, most industrial systems consist of multiple components that are interlinked. This paper aims to provide a review of approaches for system-level prognostics. To achieve this goal, the approaches are grouped into four categories: health index-based, component RUL-based, influenced component-based, and multiple failure mode-based prognostics. Issues of each approach are presented in terms of the target systems and employed algorithms. Two examples of PHM datasets are used to demonstrate how the system-level prognostics should be conducted. Challenges for practical system-level prognostics are also addressed.

AB Historically, murine models of inflammation in biomedical research have been shown to minimally correlate with genomic expression patterns from blood leukocytes in humans. In 2019, our laboratory reported an improved surgical sepsis model of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) that provides additional daily chronic stress (DCS), as well as adhering to the Minimum Quality Threshold in Pre-Clinical Sepsis Studies (MQTiPSS) guidelines. This model phenotypically recapitulates the persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome observed in adult human surgical sepsis survivors. Whether these phenotypic similarities between septic humans and mice are replicated at the circulating blood leukocyte transcriptome has not been demonstrated. Our analysis, in contrast with previous findings, demonstrated that genome-wide expression in our new murine model more closely approximated human surgical sepsis patients, particularly in the more chronic phases of sepsis. Importantly, our new model of murine surgical sepsis with chronic stress did not reflect well gene expression patterns from humans with community-acquired sepsis. Our work indicates that improved preclinical murine sepsis modeling can better replicate both the phenotypic and transcriptomic responses to surgical sepsis, but cannot be extrapolated to other sepsis etiologies. Importantly, these improved models can be a useful adjunct to human-focused and artificial intelligence-based forms of research in order to improve septic patients' morbidity and mortality.

AB Birds are unique among extant tetrapods in exhibiting air-filled cavities that arise from the respiratory system and invade postcranial bones, a phenomenon called postcranial skeletal pneumaticity (PSP). These intraosseous cavities originate from diverticula of the ventilatory air sacs or directly from the gas-exchanging lung. Despite a long history of study, many of the basic characteristics of this system remain poorly understood. In this hybrid review, we synthesize insights from the anatomical, developmental, biomechanical and paleontological literature to review the functional and evolutionary significance of PSP. Leveraging new data, we confirm that the skeletons of pneumatic birds are not less heavy for their mass than those of apneumatic birds. Pneumatic skeletons may nonetheless be lightweight with respect to body volume, but this is a hypothesis that remains to be empirically tested. We also use micro-computed tomography scanning and deep learning-based segmentation to produce a pilot model of the pneumatized spaces in the neck of a Mallard (Anas platyrhynchos). This approach facilitates accurate modelling of bone architecture for quantitative comparative analysis within and between pneumatic taxa. Future work on PSP should focus on the cellular mechanisms and developmental processes that govern the onset and extent of pneumatization, which are essentially unknown. This article is part of the theme issue 'The biology of the avian respiratory system'.

DT Article

AB Western Pacific leatherback sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) are a priority bycatch mitigation concern due to the projected extinction of the population before the end of the 21st century. The species regularly occurs as bycatch in gillnet and surface longline fisheries. Here, we explore the potential for dynamic ocean management in an emerging hotspot of leatherback sea turtle bycatch in the New Zealand pelagic longline fishery. We compared spatial areas of different sizes built from single oceanographic covariates as well as built from a composite risk surface developed through ensemble random forests. We found that, individually, the Okubo-Weiss parameter, sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly, SST, moon phase, and distance to the SST front were important oceanographic covariates for leatherback sea turtle bycatch. However, the spatial areas built from the composite risk surface were the most effective at discriminating sets with and without bycatch across a range of risk cutoffs. When we also considered implementation metrics of spatial area and coherence as part of performance, the area derived from the composite risk surface with a risk of interaction per set greater than 52% performed best. This spatial area was ephemeral, occurring 1 or 2 weeks each year, and localized, occurring along the north coast of East Cape in the North Island of New Zealand. The apparent presence of discrete spatial areas with elevated risk may be useful to inform future management in the area. Considering implementation metrics in defining utility was useful for identifying tradeoffs between the total size and the underlying covariates delineating a spatial area. As such, we recommend these types of metrics to be included when designing spatial bycatch mitigation strategies elsewhere.

ID CROP; CLIMATE
AB National crop yields are difficult to estimate during a crop season and are usually only known after crop harvest. The goal of this study was to develop a simple methodology to estimate national wheat yields that could be easily applied to any country and crop. Twenty years of readily available global gridded monthly climate data (0.5 degrees) across wheat cultivated areas of a country were correlated with national wheat production-weighted mean climate indices to determine the single most representative climate grid cell for the entire wheat region. The same 20 years of monthly climate data from this most representative grid cell were then used to build statistical models to estimate trend-corrected national wheat yields, including a Stepwise Regression function (Stepwise) set with the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm (Lasso), and a Random Forest machine-learning algorithm (Random Forest). The best of the three models estimated trend-corrected national yield variability from 1998 to 2021 for Brazil with an rRMSE of 9.1%. In an additional validation, the same approach was then applied to national wheat yields in France and Russia resulting in an rRMSE from a Leave One Out Cross Validation (LOOCV) of 6.7% and 6.4%, respectively. As the statistical models employed monthly climate data from within a season, national yield predictions are possible during a cropping season before crop harvest by using the best performing model with the predictability of a national yield further improving towards harvest. This approach should be applicable to any crop and nation.

ID MORPHOLOGICAL MEMORIES
AB This manuscript describes a new technique for segmenting color images in different color spaces based on geometrical properties of lattice auto-associative memories. Lattice associative memories are artificial neural networks able to store a finite set X of n-dimensional vectors and recall them when a noisy or incomplete input vector is presented. The canonical lattice auto-associative memories include the min memory W (XX) and the max memory M (XX) , both defined as square matrices of size nxn. The column vectors of W (XX) and M (XX) , scaled additively by the components of the minimum and maximum vector bounds of X, are used to determine a set of extreme points whose convex hull encloses X. Specifically, since color images form subsets of a finite geometrical space, the scaled column vectors of each memory will correspond to saturated color pixels. Thus, maximal tetrahedrons do exist that enclose proper subsets of pixels in X and such that other color pixels are considered as linear mixtures of extreme points determined from the scaled versions of W (XX) and M (XX) . We provide illustrative examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method including comparisons with alternative segmentation methods from the literature as well as color separation results in four different color spaces.

TI Identifying latent behavioural states in animal movement with M4, a

AB Understanding animal movement often relies upon telemetry and biologging devices. These data are frequently used to estimate latent behavioural states to help understand why animals move across the landscape. While there are a variety of methods that make behavioural inferences from biotelemetry data, some features of these methods (e.g. analysis of a single data stream, use of parametric distributions) may limit their generality to reliably discriminate among behavioural states. To address some of the limitations of existing behavioural state estimation models, we introduce a nonparametric Bayesian framework called the mixed-membership method for movement (M4), which is available within the open-source bayesmove R package. This framework can analyse multiple data streams (e.g. step length, turning angle, acceleration) without relying on parametric distributions, which may capture complex behaviours more successfully than current methods. We tested our Bayesian framework using simulated trajectories and compared model performance against two segmentation methods (behavioural change point analysis (BCPA) and segclust2d), one machine learning method [expectation-maximization binary clustering (EMbC)] and one type of state-space model [hidden Markov model (HMM)]. We also illustrated this Bayesian framework using movements of juvenile snail kites Rostrhamus sociabilis in Florida, USA. The Bayesian framework estimated breakpoints more accurately than the other segmentation methods for tracks of different lengths. Likewise, the Bayesian framework provided more accurate estimates of behaviour than the other state estimation methods when simulations were generated from less frequently considered distributions (e.g. truncated normal, beta, uniform). Three behavioural states were estimated from snail kite movements, which were labelled as 'encamped', 'area-restricted search' and 'transit'. Changes in these behaviours over time were associated with known dispersal events from the nest site, as well as movements to and from possible breeding locations. Our nonparametric Bayesian framework estimated behavioural states with comparable or superior accuracy compared to the other methods when step lengths and turning angles of simulations were generated from less frequently considered distributions. Since the most appropriate parametric distributions may not be obvious a priori, methods (such as M4) that are agnostic to the underlying distributions can provide powerful alternatives to address questions in movement ecology.

AB We study association between the structural connectivity and cognitive profiles using a multi-response nonparametric regression model. The cognitive profiles are quantified by seven cognitive test scores, and structural connectivity is represented by nine nodal attributes of connectivity graphs. These nodal centralities together encode different connectivity profiles in the brain network. Nodal attributes may be grouped together for each node, motivating us to introduce group sparsity for feature selection, and radial basis function (RBF)-nets are used to quantify the regression effects. An efficient computation algorithm is developed. Applying our proposed method to Human Connectome Project data, we obtain several interesting findings related to cognitive functioning.

AB Alcohol use disorder (AUD) commonly is associated with compromise in neurobiological and/or neurobehavioral processes. The severity of this compromise varies across individuals and outcomes, as does the degree to which recovery of function is achieved. This narrative review first summarizes neurobehavioral, neurophysiological, structural, and neurochemical aberrations/deficits that are frequently observed in people with AUD after detoxification. Subsequent sections review improvements across these domains during recovery, taking into account modulators of recovery to the extent permitted. Where appropriate, the discussion includes work integrating outcomes across domains, leveraging the strengths of diverse experimental methods. Interventions to ameliorate neurobiological or neurobehavioral deficits do not constitute a primary objective of this review. However, their consideration is a logical inclusion. Therefore, a limited introduction to existing methods is also presented.

AB Cholinergic neurons may influence the neural networks that subserve language, To learn if cholinergic drugs enhance the ability of anemic aphasic patients to name objects, we conducted studies of physostigmine and lecithin in three patients with anemia due to focal brain lesions, The first patient studied was amnestic and anemic, and presumed to be cholinergic-deficient due to a basal forebrain lesion, In open and blinded trials confrontation naming improved consistently with treatment but other cognitive measures did not, We subsequently tested two additional anemic patients with lesions outside the basal forebrain, We found improvement in confrontation naming but not other measures of cognition or mood during open-label physostigmine treatment, Physostigmine appears to improve naming in patients with anemia.

AB The transcription factor Pax6 is an important regulator of early animal development. Loss of function mutations of pax6 in a range of animals result in a reduction or complete loss of the eye, a reduction of a subset of neurons, and defects in axon growth. There are no studies focusing on the role of pax6 during development of any lophotrochozoan representative, however, expression of pax6 in the developing eye and nervous system in a number of species suggest that pax6 plays a highly conserved role in eye and nervous system formation. We investigated the functional role of pax6 during development of the marine annelid Capitella teleta. Expression ofpax6 transcripts in C. teleta larvae is similar to patterns found in other animals, with distinct subdomains in the brain and ventral nerve cord as well as in the larval and juvenile eye. To perturb pax6 function, two different splice-blocking morpholinos and a translation-blocking morpholino were used. Larvae resulting from microinjections with either splice-blocking morpholino show a reduction of the pax6 transcript. Development of both the larval eyes and the central nervous system architecture are highly disrupted following microinjection of each of the three morpholinos. The less severe phenotype observed when only the homeodomain is disrupted suggests that presence of the paired domain is sufficient for partial function of the Pax6 protein. Preliminary downstream target analysis confirms disruption in expression of some components of the retinal gene regulatory network, as well as disruption of genes involved in nervous system development. Results from this study, taken together with studies from other species, reveal an evolutionarily conserved role for pax6 in eye and neural specification and development.

AB Paradigms requiring either a GO or a NO-GO response are often used to study the neural mechanisms of response inhibition. Here this issue is examined from the perspective of event-related beta (14-30 Hz) oscillatory activity. Two macaque monkeys performed a task that began with a self-initiated lever depression and maintenance (sustained motor output) and required a visual pattern discrimination followed by either a lever release (GO) or continued lever-holding (NO-GO) response. Analyzing simultaneous local field potentials (LFPs) from primary somatosensory, frontal motor, and posterior parietal cortices, we report two results. First, beta oscillation desynchronized shortly after stimulus presentation, the onset of which was approximately the same for both the GO and NO-GO conditions (similar to 110 ms). Since it is well known that beta desynchronization is a reliable indicator of movement preparation, this result suggests that early motor preparation took place in both conditions. Second, following the GO/NO-GO decision (similar to 190 ms), beta activity rebounded significantly (similar to 300 ms) only in the NO-GO condition. Coherence and Granger causality measures revealed that the dynamical organization of the rebounded beta network was similar to that existing during the sustained motor output prior to stimulus onset. This finding suggests that response inhibition led to the restoration of the sensorimotor network to its prestimulus state. (C) 2008 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Lakes constitute 20-40% of Arctic lowlands, the largest surface water fraction of any terrestrial biome. These lakes provide crucial habitat for wildlife, supply water for remote Arctic communities and play an important role in carbon cycling and the regional energy balance. Recent evidence suggests that climate change is shifting these systems towards long-term wetting (lake formation or expansion) or drying. The net direction and cause of these shifts, however, are not well understood. Here, we present evidence for large-scale drying across lake-rich regions of the Arctic over the past two decades (2000-2021), a trend that is correlated with increases in annual air temperature and autumn rain. Given that increasing air temperatures and autumn rain promote permafrost thaw, our results indicate that permafrost thaw is leading to widespread surface water decline, challenging models that do not predict a net decrease in lake area until the mid-twenty-first or twenty-second centuries.
   The Arctic lowlands are characterized by a large number of lakes that cover a substantial part of the surface in some regions. Here, the authors apply a machine learning approach to satellite data to show that permafrost thaw since 2000 has caused a decline in surface water in these regions.

AB For the safety of low flying aircraft, it will become increasingly important that an aircraft should have the ability to detect and avoid small obstacles in the low flying environment. In recent years, using context information to assist in detecting power lines has shown great potential to better detect power lines at a remote distance. Therefore, how to adequately use the context information for a better detection is a hot issue of concern. This paper proposes a novel auxiliary assisted power line detection method, in which the spatial context disparity of auxiliaries is quantitatively and uniformly evaluated for the first time. As a cognitive strategy, the spatial context disparity depends on two factors, the spatial context peakedness and the spatial context difference. With this cognitive method, objects that achieve high spatial context disparity scores are more suitable for being the auxiliaries of the power lines. Experimental results show that, owing to the spatial context disparity, the proposed method can acquire proper auxiliaries with abundant context information to support the detection, so that better power line detections are achieved comparing to traditional power line detection methods. The proposed power line detection method, which can automatically choose the optimal auxiliaries, is effective and has the potential for practical use in ensuring the flight safety of unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) in the low flying environment.

TI ATPGNN: Reconstruction of Neighborhood in Graph Neural Networks With
   Attention-Based Topological Patterns
SO IEEE ACCESS
LA English
DT Article
DE Semi-supervised node classification; GNNs; network embedding
AB Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been applied in many fields of semi-supervised node classification for non-Euclidean data. However, some GNNs cannot make good use of positive information brought by nodes which are far away from each central node for aggregation operations. These remote nodes with positive information can enhance the representation of the central node. Some GNNs also ignore rich structure information around each central node's surroundings or entire network. Besides, most of GNNs have a fixed architecture and cannot change their components to adapt to different tasks. In this article, we propose a semi-supervised learning platform ATPGNN with three variable components to overcome the above shortcomings. This novel model can fully adapt to different tasks by changing its components and support inductive learning. The key idea is that we first create a high-order topology graph, which is from similarity of node structure information. Specifically, we reconstruct the relationships between nodes in a potential space obtained by network embedding in graph. Second, we introduce graph representation learning methods to extract representation information of remote nodes on the high-order topology graph. Third, we use some network embedding methods to get graph structure information of each node. Finally, we combine the representation information of remote nodes, graph structure information and feature for each node by attention mechanism, and apply them to learning node representation in graph. Extensive experiments on real attributed networks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model against traditional GNNs.

TI Type 1 diabetes prevention clinical trial simulator: Case reports of
   model-informed drug development tool

DT Article
AB Clinical trials seeking to delay or prevent the onset of type 1 diabetes (T1D) face a series of pragmatic challenges. Despite more than 100 years since the discovery of insulin, teplizumab remains the only FDA-approved therapy to delay progression from Stage 2 to Stage 3 T1D. To increase the efficiency of clinical trials seeking this goal, our project sought to inform T1D clinical trial designs by developing a disease progression model-based clinical trial simulation tool. Using individual-level data collected from the TrialNet Pathway to Prevention and The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young natural history studies, we previously developed a quantitative joint model to predict the time to T1D onset. We then applied trial-specific inclusion/exclusion criteria, sample sizes in treatment and placebo arms, trial duration, assessment interval, and dropout rate. We implemented a function for presumed drug effects. To increase the size of the population pool, we generated virtual populations using multivariate normal distribution and ctree machine learning algorithms. As an output, power was calculated, which summarizes the probability of success, showing a statistically significant difference in the time distribution until the T1D diagnosis between the two arms. Using this tool, power curves can also be generated through iterations. The web-based tool is publicly available: . Herein, we briefly describe the tool and provide instructions for simulating a planned clinical trial with two case studies. This tool will allow for improved clinical trial designs and accelerate efforts seeking to prevent or delay the onset of T1D.

AB Three-dimensional, high-resolution crustal and upper mantle P and S wave velocity (Vp and Vs) models are presented for the central United States using body wave tomography. The study utilizes local and teleseismic data recorded by the Northern Embayment Lithospheric Experiment stations, the CERI New Madrid Seismic Network, the Earthscope Transportable Array, and the Ozark Illinois INdiana Kentucky Flexible Array. Vp and Vs solutions are very similar and are well resolved in the depth range 40 to 400 km. Two anomalously slow regions are present below the Illinois Basin, forming a northwest dipping low-velocity zone (LVZ) extending from similar to 200 to 400 km. Maximum anomaly magnitudes in the LVZ reach about -4% and -5% for Vp and Vs, respectively. The LVZ appears to connect to a well-documented LVZ located below the northern Mississippi Embayment. The Illinois Basin velocity anomalies cannot be explained by elevated temperature alone and require compositional heterogeneity involving elevated orthopyroxene content in addition to an increase in iron and water content. The need for additional orthopyroxene suggests that the LVZ is being produced by metasomatism of mantle rocks by hydrous, silica-rich fluids ascending from a slab fragment trapped in or near the transition zone. This supports previous interpretations for the existence of the LVZ below the Embayment. We suggest that the LVZs below the Mississippi Embayment and the Illinois Basin are linked to the presence of a large igneous province, which convection models suggest is currently located below the central United States.
   Plain Language Summary We present three-dimensional, high-resolution velocity models from the Earth's surface to 410 km depth under the central United States. Our study utilizes seismic tomography-a technique that images the velocity structure of the Earth using seismic waves that traveled from earthquake sources to seismic stations. Travel-time data recorded by several seismic arrays (dense deployments of seismic stations) were acquired to increase the resolution of our model. In the resulting model, compressional wave and shear wave velocity anomalies are similar and are well-resolved in the depth range 40 to 400 km. An anomalously slow region is present below the Illinois Basin that dips to the northwest and extends to 400 km. The low velocity cannot be explained by elevated temperature alone and requires an increase in iron and water content as well as high amounts of orthopyroxene. Elevated orthopyroxene suggests that the mantle rocks have been chemically altered due to fluids coming from a trapped slab fragment. We suggest that the low-velocity zone below the Illinois Basin is associated with the presence of a slab fragment containing a thick oceanic plateau. According to several studies, the plateau was subducted millions of years ago and is presently located underneath the central United States.

AB Dye-release and numerical modeling experiments are conducted to investigate horizontal dispersion in a partially mixed estuary. Longitudinal dispersion of a dye patch shows marked flood-ebb asymmetry in the first two tidal cycles after a dye release, with most of the dispersion occurring during ebb tides. There are large differences in the dispersion rate between spring and neap tides. Due to increased vertical mixing during spring tides, a dye patch quickly extends from the bottom to the surface and is exposed to the vertical shear in the entire water column, enhancing longitudinal dispersion. In contrast, most of the dye patch is limited to the bottom few meters during the neap tides. Although decreased vertical mixing during neap tides facilitates longitudinal dispersion, the vertical shear across the thin dye patch in the bottom layer is much weaker than the full water column shear in spring tides. Decreased shear leads to reduced longitudinal dispersion. After four tidal cycles, the second moment of the dye patch increases with time in the along-channel direction at a power of between 2 and 3. The longitudinal dispersion rate varies as the four thirds power of the dye patch size, indicating scale-dependent diffusion.
   Plain Language Summary Dye-release field experiments and numerical modeling experiments are conducted to investigate horizontal dispersion in a partially mixed estuary. The dispersion of a dye patch in the along-channel direction shows marked difference between flood and ebb period in the first 27hr after a dye release, with most of the dispersion occurring during ebb tides. There are large differences in the dispersion rate between spring and neap tides.

AB Nonhuman primates (NHPs) are an essential research model for gaining a comprehensive understanding of the neural mechanisms of neurocognitive aging in our own species. In the present study, we used resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) to investigate the relationship between prefrontal cortical and striatal neural interactions, and cognitive flexibility, in unanaesthetized common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) at two time points during late middle age (8 months apart, similar to a span of 5-6 years in humans). Based on our previous findings, we also determine the reproducibility of connectivity measures over the course of 8 months, particularly previously observed sex differences in rsFC. Male marmosets exhibited remarkably similar patterns of stronger functional connectivity relative to females and greater cognitive flexibility between the two imaging time points. Network analysis revealed that the consistent sex differences in connectivity and related cognitive associations were characterized by greater node strength and/or degree values in several prefrontal, premotor and temporal regions, as well as stronger intra PFC connectivity, in males compared to females. The current study supports the existence of robust sex differences in prefrontal and striatal resting state networks that may contribute to differences in cognitive function and offers insight on the neural systems that may be compromised in cognitive aging and age-related conditions such as mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease.

AB Eye-gaze direction plays a fundamental role in the perception of facial features and particularly the processing of emotional facial expressions. Yet, the neural underpinnings of the integration of eye gaze and emotional facial cues are not well understood. The primary aim of this study was to delineate the functional networks that subserve the recognition of emotional expressions as a function of eye gaze. Participants were asked to identify happy, angry, or neutral faces, displayed with direct or averted gaze, while their neural responses were measured with fMRI. The results showed that recognition of happy expressions, irrespective of eye-gaze direction, engaged the critical nodes of the default mode network. Recognition of angry faces, on the other hand, was gaze-dependent, engaging the critical nodes of the salience network when presented with direct gaze, but fronto-parietal areas when presented with averted gaze. Functional connectivity analysis further showed gaze-dependent engagement of a large-scale network connected to bilateral amygdala during the recognition of angry expressions. This study provides important insights into the functional connectivity between the amygdala and other critical social-cognitive brain nodes, which are essential in processing of ambiguous, potentially threatening social signals. These findings have implications for psychiatric disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, which are characterized by aberrant limbic connectivity.

AB The UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) is an automatic aircraft, widely used several applications like emergency management, wildlife conservation, forestry, aerial photography, etc. The communication among the UAV is susceptible to security threats with several diverse attacks. The data sharing among the UAV and other vehicles is vulnerable to jamming and suspicious activities that disturbs the communication. To tackle the issue, IDS (Intrusion Detection System) is the significant system that monitors and identifies the suspicious activities in the communication network. To attain this, several conventional researchers attempted to accomplish better intrusion detection. However, classical models are limited by accuracy, noise and computation. To overcome the limitation, proposed method employs particular set of procedures for the intrusion detection in UAV with Intrusion UAV dataset. The dataset comprise of features like drone speed, height, width, velocity etc. Initially, in the respective approach, GG (Greedy based Genetic) algorithm for feature selection, which maintains the exact balance between the greediness and diversified population. Greedy approach enhances Genetic algorithm in combinatorial optimisation problems. Further, the study proposes Modified Deep CNNBiLSTM (Deep Convolutional Neural Network and Bi-Long Short Term Memory) with attention mechanism for classification of intrusion in UAV. The deep CNN is utilized for the ability of handling larger datasets and accuracy. Conversely, it is limited by computation and speed. To tackle the problem, Bi-LSTM is used for the capability of enhancing the computation and speed. Moreover, attention mechanism is used for handle the complexity and to permit the presented system to focus on the significant and relevant data. Correspondingly, proposed approach performance is calculated using performance metrics such as accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, ������2 (R -Squared), execution time, RMSE and precision. Furthermore, comparative analysis of the proposed method and classical model exposes the efficacy of the respective system.

AB In this study, we created four network topologies composed of living cortical neurons and compared resultant structural-functional dynamics including the nature and quality of information transmission. Each living network was composed of living cortical neurons and were created using microstamping of adhesion promoting molecules and each was "designed" with different levels of convergence embedded within each structure. Networks were cultured over a grid of electrodes that permitted detailed measurements of neural activity at each node in the network. Of the topologies we tested, the "Random" networks in which neurons connect based on their own intrinsic properties transmitted information embedded within their spike trains with higher fidelity relative to any other topology we tested. Within our patterned topologies in which we explicitly manipulated structure, the effect of convergence on fidelity was dependent on both topology and time-scale (rate vs. temporal coding). A more detailed examination using tools from network analysis revealed that these changes in fidelity were also associated with a number of other structural properties including a node's degree, degree-degree correlations, path length, and clustering coefficients. Whereas information transmission was apparent among nodes with few connections, the greatest transmission fidelity was achieved among the few nodes possessing the highest number of connections (high degree nodes or putative hubs). These results provide a unique view into the relationship between structure and its affect on transmission fidelity, at least within these small neural populations with defined network topology. They also highlight the potential role of tools such as microstamp printing and microelectrode array recordings to construct and record from arbitrary network topologies to provide a new direction in which to advance the study of structure-function relationships.

AB Myc-deficient mice fail to develop normal vascular networks and Myc-deficient embryonic stem cells fail to provoke a tumor angiogenic response when injected into immune compromised mice. However, the molecular underpinnings of these defects are poorly understood. To assess whether Myc indeed contributes to embryonic vasculogenesis we evaluated Myc function in Xenopus laevis embryogenesis. Here, we report that Xc-Myc is required for the normal assembly of endothelial cells into patent vessels during both angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. Accordingly, the specific knockdown of Xc-Myc provokes massive embryonic edema and hemorrhage. Conversely, Xc-Myc overexpression triggers the formation of ectopic vascular beds in embryos. Myc is required for normal expression of Slug/Snail2 and Twist, and either XSlug/Snail2 or XTwist could compensate for defects manifest by Xc-Myc knockdown. Importantly, knockdown of Xc-Myc, XSlug/Snail2 or XTwist within the lateral plate mesoderm, but not the neural crest, provoked embryonic edema and hemorrhage. Collectively, these findings support a model in which Myc, Twist and Slug/Snail2 function in a regulatory circuit within lateral plate mesoderm that directs normal vessel formation in both the vascular and lymphatic systems.

   Progression of disease; Time varying

AB BackgroundWith the recent surge in the utilization of electronic health records for cognitive decline, the research community has turned its attention to conducting fine-grained analyses of dementia onset using advanced techniques. Previous works have mostly focused on machine learning-based prediction of dementia, lacking the analysis of dementia progression and its associations with risk factors over time. The black box nature of machine learning models has also raised concerns regarding their uncertainty and safety in decision making, particularly in sensitive domains like healthcare.ObjectiveWe aimed to characterize the progression of health conditions, such as chronic diseases and neuropsychiatric symptoms, of the participants in Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) from initial mild cognitive impairment (MCI) diagnosis to dementia onset through network analysis.MethodsWe used the data from the MCSA, a prospective population-based cohort study of cognitive aging, and examined the changing association among variables (i.e., participants' health conditions) from the first visit of MCI diagnosis to the visit of dementia onset using network analysis. The number of participants for this study are 97 with the number of visits ranging from 2 visits (30 months) to 7 visits (105 months). We identified the network communities among variables from three-fold collection of instances: (i) the first MCI diagnosis, (ii) progression to dementia, and (iii) dementia diagnosis. We determine the variables that play a significant role in the dementia onset, aiming to identify and prioritize specific variables that prominently contribute towards developing dementia. In addition, we explore the sex-specific impact of variables in relation to dementia, aiming to investigate potential differences in the influence of certain variables on dementia onset between males and females.ResultsWe found correlation among certain variables, such as neuropsychiatric symptoms and chronic conditions, throughout the progression from MCI to dementia. Our findings, based on patterns and changing variables within specific communities, reveal notable insights about the time-lapse before dementia sets in, and the significance of progression of correlated variables contributing towards dementia onset. We also observed more changes due to certain variables, such as cognitive and functional scores, in the network communities for the people who progressed to dementia compared to those who does not. Most changes for sex-specific analysis are observed in clinical dementia rating and functional activities questionnaire during MCI onset are followed by chronic diseases, and then by NPI-Q scores.ConclusionsNetwork analysis has shown promising potential to capture significant longitudinal changes in health conditions, spanning from the MCI diagnosis to dementia progression. It can serve as a valuable analytic approach for monitoring the health status of individuals in cognitive impairment assessment. Furthermore, our findings indicate a notable sex difference in the impact of specific health conditions on the progression of dementia.

AB Neuromorphic systems, which emulate neural functionalities of a human brain, are considered to be an attractive next-generation computing approach, with advantages of high energy efficiency and fast computing speed. After these neuromorphic systems are proposed, it is demonstrated that artificial synapses and neurons can mimic neural functions of biological synapses and neurons. However, since the neuromorphic functionalities are highly related to the surface properties of materials, bulk material-based neuromorphic devices suffer from uncontrollable defects at surfaces and strong scattering caused by dangling bonds. Therefore, 2D materials which have dangling-bond-free surfaces and excellent crystallinity have emerged as promising candidates for neuromorphic computing hardware. First, the fundamental synaptic behavior is reviewed, such as synaptic plasticity and learning rule, and requirements of artificial synapses to emulate biological synapses. In addition, an overview of recent advances on 2D materials-based synaptic devices is summarized by categorizing these into various working principles of artificial synapses. Second, the compulsory behavior and requirements of artificial neurons such as the all-or-nothing law and refractory periods to simulate a spike neural network are described, and the implementation of 2D materials-based artificial neurons to date is reviewed. Finally, future challenges and outlooks of 2D materials-based neuromorphic devices are discussed.

AB A dynamic neural network (DNN) observer-based output feedback controller for uncertain nonlinear systems with bounded disturbances is developed. The DNN-based observer works in conjunction with a dynamic filter for state estimation using only output measurements during online operation. A sliding mode term is included in the DNN structure to robustly account for exogenous disturbances and reconstruction errors. Weight update laws for the DNN, based on estimation errors, tracking errors, and the filter output are developed, which guarantee asymptotic regulation of the state estimation error. A combination of a DNN feedforward term, along with the estimated state feedback and sliding mode terms yield an asymptotic tracking result. The developed output feedback (OFB) method yields asymptotic tracking and asymptotic estimation of unmeasurable states for a class of uncertain nonlinear systems with bounded disturbances. A two-link robot manipulator is used to investigate the performance of the proposed control approach.

AB In human-robot collaboration, robots and humans must work together in shared, overlapping, workspaces to accomplish tasks. If human and robot motion can be coordinated, then collisions between robot and human can seamlessly be avoided without requiring either of them to stop work. A key part of this coordination is anticipating humans' future motion so robot motion can be adapted proactively. In this work, a generative neural network predicts a multi-step sequence of human poses for tabletop reaching motions. The multi-step sequence is mapped to a time-series based on a human speed versus motion distance model. The input to the network is the human's reaching target relative to current pelvis location combined with current human pose. A dataset was generated of human motions to reach various positions on or above the table in front of the human starting from a wide variety of initial human poses. After training the network, experiments showed that the predicted sequences generated by this method matched the actual recordings of human motion within an L2 joint error of 7.6 cm and L2 link roll-pitch-yaw error of 0.301 rad on average. This method predicts motion for an entire reach motion without suffering from the exponential propagation of prediction error that limits the horizon of prior works.

AB Motivation: Random forests are fast, flexible and represent a robust approach to analyze high dimensional data. A key advantage over alternative machine learning algorithms are variable importance measures, which can be used to identify relevant features or perform variable selection. Measures based on the impurity reduction of splits, such as the Gini importance, are popular because they are simple and fast to compute. However, they are biased in favor of variables with many possible split points and high minor allele frequency.
   Results: We set up a fast approach to debias impurity-based variable importance measures for classification, regression and survival forests. We show that it creates a variable importance measure which is unbiased with regard to the number of categories and minor allele frequency and almost as fast as the standard impurity importance. As a result, it is now possible to compute reliable importance estimates without the extra computing cost of permutations. Further, we combine the importance measure with a fast testing procedure, producing p-values for variable importance with almost no computational overhead to the creation of the random forest. Applications to gene expression and genome-wide association data show that the proposed method is powerful and computationally efficient.

AB Non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) infection is an emerging infectious entity that often presents as lymphadenitis in the pediatric age group. Current practice involves invasive testing and excisional biopsy to diagnose NTM lymphadenitis. In this study, we performed a retrospective analysis of 249 lymph nodes selected from 143 CT scans of pediatric patients presenting with lymphadenopathy at the Montreal Children's Hospital between 2005 and 2018. A Random Forest classifier was trained on the ten most discriminative features from a set of 1231 radiomic features. The model classifying nodes as pyogenic, NTM, reactive, or proliferative lymphadenopathy achieved an accuracy of 72%, a precision of 68%, and a recall of 70%. Between NTM and all other causes of lymphadenopathy, the model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 89%. Between NTM and pyogenic lymphadenitis, the model achieved an AUC of 90%. Between NTM and the reactive and proliferative lymphadenopathy groups, the model achieved an AUC of 93%. These results indicate that radiomics can achieve a high accuracy for classification of NTM lymphadenitis. Such a non-invasive highly accurate diagnostic approach has the potential to reduce the need for invasive procedures in the pediatric population.

TI Diversity in news recommendations using contextual bandits

DE Recommender systems; Contextual bandit; Fairness; Equitable machine

AB Contextual bandit techniques have recently been used for generating personalized user recommendations in situations where collaborative filtering based algorithms may be inefficient. They are often used in cases when input data are dynamically changing as new users and content items, such as news, constantly change. Contextual bandit methods sequentially select articles for recommendation to a user and continuously modify their strategies so as to present users with articles that maximize clicks. However, exclusively focusing on maximizing the number of clicks can lead to over-exposure of certain articles, while under-representing others. In an era of ever growing demand for digital news delivery, this, in turn, invokes the important notion of presenting news content to users in a "socially responsible"way. To this effect, we introduce a technique based on the contextual bandit framework that, in addition to maximization of the click rate, also considers historical frequency of an article as the "cost"associated with recommending it. It is demonstrated that this approach results in a more balanced distribution and a diverse set of recommended articles. Experiments utilizing a benchmark news dataset demonstrate the trade-off between clicks and diversity of recommended articles.

AB The American lobster, Homarus americanus, is integral to marine ecosystems and supports an important commercial fishery. This iconic species also serves as a valuable model for deciphering neural networks controlling rhythmic motor patterns and olfaction. Here, we report a high-quality draft assembly of the H. americanus genome with 25,284 predicted gene models. Analysis of the neural gene complement revealed extraordinary development of the chemosensory machinery, including a profound diversification of ligand-gated ion channels and secretory molecules. The discovery of a novel class of chimeric receptors coupling pattern recognition and neurotransmitter binding suggests a deep integration between the neural and immune systems. A robust repertoire of genes involved in innate immunity, genome stability, cell survival, chemical defense, and cuticle formation represents a diversity of defense mechanisms essential to thrive in the benthic marine environment. Together, these unique evolutionary adaptations contribute to the longevity and ecological success of this long-lived benthic predator.

AB Normal adult aging is associated with difficulties in processing social cues to emotions such as anger and also altered motivation to focus more on positive than negative information. Gaze direction is an important modifier of the social signals conveyed by an emotion, for example, an angry face looking directly at you is considerably more threatening than an angry face looking away. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that older adults would show less neural differentiation to angry faces with direct and avert gaze compared to younger people, with the opposite prediction for happy faces. Healthy older (65-75 years; mean = 69.75) and younger (17-27 years; mean = 20.65) adults completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment in which they were asked to identify happy and angry expressions displayed either with direct or averted gaze. While younger adults showed neural sensitivity to eye-gaze direction during recognition of angry expressions, older adults showed no effect of eye-gaze direction on neural response. In contrast, older adults showed sensitivity to eye-gaze direction during recognition of happy expressions but younger adults did not. Additionally, brain-behavior correlations were conducted to investigate the relationships between emotion recognition and mentalizing brain network in both age groups. Younger (but not older) adults' social cognitive performance was differentially correlated with activation in 2 brain networks when looking at angry faces with direct compared to averted gaze. These novel findings provide evidence for age-related differences in the neural substrates underlying the capacity to integrate facial affect and eye-gaze cues. The results of this study suggest that age-related differences in integrating facial cues may be related to engagement of the mentalizing network, with potentially important implications for social cognitive functioning in late adulthood.

AB Pompe disease is due to mutations in the gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA). Absence of functional GAA typically results in cardiorespiratory failure in the first year; reduced GAA activity is associated with progressive respiratory failure later in life. While skeletal muscle pathology contributes to respiratory insufficiency in Pompe disease, emerging evidence indicates that respiratory neuron dysfunction is also a significant part of dysfunction in motor units. Animal models show profound glycogen accumulation in spinal and medullary respiratory neurons and altered neural activity. Tissues from Pompe patients show central nervous system glycogen accumulation and motoneuron pathology. A neural mechanism raises considerations about the current clinical approach of enzyme replacement since the recombinant protein does not cross the blood-brain-barrier. Indeed, clinical data suggest that enzyme replacement therapy delays symptom progression, but many patients eventually require ventilatory assistance, especially during sleep. We propose that treatments which restore GAA activity to respiratory muscles, neurons and networks will be required to fully correct ventilatory insufficiency in Pompe disease.

AB Emx1 has long been implicated in embryonic brain development. Previously we found that mice null of Emx1 gene had smaller dentate gyri and reduced neurogenesis, although the molecular mechanisms underlying this defect was not well understood. To decipher the role of Emx1 gene in neural regeneration and the timing of its involvement, we determine the frequency of neural stem cells (NSCs) in embryonic and adult forebrains of Emx1 wild type (WT) and knock out (KO) mice in the neurosphere assay. Emx1 gene deletion reduced the frequency and self-renewal capacity of NSCs of the embryonic brain but did not affect neuronal or glial differentiation. Emx1 KO NSCs also exhibited a reduced migratory capacity in response to serum or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the Boyden chamber migration assay compared to their WT counterparts. A thorough comparison between NSC lysates from Emx1 WT and KO mice utilizing 2D-PAGE coupled with tandem mass spectrometry revealed 38 proteins differentially expressed between genotypes, including the F-actin depolymerization factor Cofilin. A global systems biology and cluster analysis identified several potential mechanisms and cellular pathways implicated in altered neurogenesis, all involving Cofilin1. Protein interaction network maps with functional enrichment analysis further indicated that the differentially expressed proteins participated in neural-specific functions including brain development, axonal guidance, synaptic transmission, neurogenesis, and hippocampal morphology, with VEGF as the upstream regulator intertwined with Cofilin1 and Emx1 Functional validation analysis indicated that apart from the overall reduced level of phosphorylated Cofilin1 (p-Cofilin1) in the Emx1 KO NSCs compared to WT NSCs as demonstrated in the western blot analysis. VEGF was able to induce more Cofilin1 phosphorylation and FLK expression only in the latter. Our results suggest that a defect in Cofilin1 phosphorylation induced by VEGF or other growth factors might contribute to the reduced neurogenesis in the Emx1 null mice during brain development.

TI Nuclear fuel qualification: History, current state, and future
SO PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY
LA English
DT Review
ID NEURAL-NETWORK
AB The qualification of nuclear fuel is the process by which a fuel is certified for use within a reactor design. This process involves massive technical and procedural coordination across multiple private and public institutions with long project completion timelines. The current frameworks published in literature do not address roles of private reactor developers in the qualification process, nor the regulatory requirements that form the background for fuel qualification. These roles requirements are not static and have evolved throughout the development of the commercial nuclear industry. UO2 2 fuel, the only fuel considered fully qualified today, achieved its status in large part due to its early selection and rapid deployment under a still developing regulatory landscape. Today, fuel qualification efforts must operate within modern regulatory realities, which will require extensive testing and model development. Building on the existing fuel qualification frameworks, we define the optimal roles of the parties involved with fuel qualification. We also suggest viewing experimental efforts through a data-centric perspective in which parallel improvements can be made in collection, processing, and storage to facilitate quicker qualification timelines. These efforts then promote advanced modeling efforts, such as mechanistic modeling and digital twin development.

AB Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) and Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) of civil infrastructure has been an active area of research for the past few decades. Due to rising costs, safety issues and error of human inspection methods, automated methods for bridge inspection and maintenance are being proposed. The purpose of this research is to develop an automated rebar detection and localization system utilizing supervised (Deep Residual Networks) and unsupervised (Kmeans clustering) techniques. Data has been collected from nine bridges using Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) sensors. The performance of the proposed rebar detection and localization system has been evaluated on a wide-range of performance metrics, which emphasize the superior performance of the proposed technique over existing methods. The results reveal positive correlation between number of layers of networks, training time and other performance metrics. The overall performance of the proposed system is also dataset-dependent with factors such as noise artefacts, reflections and visual quality of rebar profiles.

AB Acute intermittent hypoxia (AIH) elicits distinct mechanisms of phrenic motor plasticity initiated by brainstem neural network activation versus local (spinal) tissue hypoxia. With moderate AIH (mAIH), hypoxemia activates the carotid body chemoreceptors and (subsequently) brainstem neural networks associated with the peripheral chemoreflex, including medullary raphe serotonergic neurons. Serotonin release and receptor activation in the phrenic motor nucleus then elicits phrenic long-term facilitation (pLTF). This mechanism is independent of tissue hypoxia, since electrical carotid sinus nerve stimulation elicits similar serotonin-dependent pLTF. In striking contrast, severe AIH (sAIH) evokes a spinal adenosine-dependent, serotonin-independent mechanism of pLTF. Spinal tissue hypoxia per se is the likely cause of sAIH-induced pLTF, since local tissue hypoxia elicits extra cellular adenosine accumulation. Thus, any physiological condition exacerbating spinal tissue hypoxia is expected to shift the balance towards adenosinergic pLTF. However, since these mechanisms compete for dominance due to mutual cross-talk inhibition, the transition from serotonin to adenosine dominant pLTF is rather abrupt. Any factor that compromises spinal cord circulation will limit oxygen availability in spinal cord tissue, favoring a shift in the balance towards adenosinergic mechanisms. Such shifts may arise experimentally from treatments such as carotid denervation, or spontaneous hypotension or anemia. Many neurological disorders, such as spinal cord injury or stroke compromise local circulatory control, potentially modulating tissue oxygen, adenosine levels and, thus, phrenic motor plasticity. In this brief review, we discuss the concept that local (spinal) circulatory control and/or oxygen delivery regulates the relative contributions of distinct pathways to phrenic motor plasticity.

AB The central nervous melanocortin system forms a neural network that maintains energy homeostasis. Actions involving neural melanocortin-3 receptors (MC3Rs) regulate the expression rhythms in ingestive behaviors and metabolism anticipating nutrient intake. Here, we characterized the response of Mc3r knockout (Mc3r-/-) and wild type (WT) mice to a restricted feeding (RF) schedule where food access was limited to a 4-h period mid light cycle using a mechanical barrier. Mc3r-/- mice adapted poorly to the food restriction schedule. Anticipatory activity and the initial bout of intense feeding activity associated with granting food access were attenuated in Mc3r-/- mice, resulting in increased weight loss relative to controls. To investigate whether activity in specific hypothalamic nuclei contribute to the Mc3r-/- phenotype observed, we assessed hypothalamic FOS-immunoreactivity (FOS-IR) associated with food restriction. Food access markedly increased FOS-IR in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), but not in the suprachiasmatic or ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei (SCN and VMN, respectively) compared to ad libitum fed mice. Mc3r-/- mice displayed a significant reduction in FOS-IR in the DMH during feeding. Analysis of MC3R signaling in vitro indicated dose-dependent stimulation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway by the MC3R agonist d-Trp(8)-?MSH. Treatment of WT mice with d-Trp(8)-?MSH administered intracerebroventricularly increased the number of pERK neurons 1.7-fold in the DMH. These observations provide further support for the involvement of the MC3Rs in regulating adaptation to food restriction. Moreover, MC3Rs may modulate the activity of neurons in the DMH, a region previously linked to the expression of the anticipatory response to RF.

AB Computed tomography (CT) images are formally taken as an assistance of early diagnosis in lung nodule analysis. Thus the accurate lung nodule segmentation is in great need for image-driven tasks. However, as heterogeneity exists between different types of lung nodules, the similar visual appearance between the pixels of nodules and pixels of non-nodule area make it difficult for automatic lung nodule segmentation. In this article, we propose a fast end-to-end framework, called Fast Multi-crop Guided Attention (FMGA) network, to accurately segment lung nodules in CT images. Our method utilizes multi-crop nodule slices as input to aggregate contextual information (2D context from current image slice and 3D context from adjacent axial slices), and exploits a global convolutional layer for nodule pixel embedding matching. To further make use of the information from border pixels near the nodule margin for better segmentation, we develop a weighted loss function to facilitate the model training by considering a balanced class samples of pixels around the nodule margin. Moreover, we utilize a central pooling layer to facilitate the contexts feature propagation in pixel neighbors. We evaluate our method on the largest public lung CT dataset LIDC and the collected lung CT data from Wuhan local hospital, respectively. Experimental results show that FMGA achieves superior performance among the state-of-the-arts. In addition, we give an ablation study and visualization results to illustrate how each component works for accurate lung nodule segmentation.

AB Recognizing human expression in videos is a challenging task due to dynamic changes in facial actions and diverse visual appearances. The key to design a reliable video-based expression recognition system is to extract robust spatial features and make full use of temporal modality characteristics. In this paper, we present a novel network architecture called Cascaded Attention Network (CAN) which is a cascaded spatiotemporal model incorporating with both spatial and temporal attention, tailored to video-level facial expression recognition. The cascaded fundamental model consists of a transfer convolutional network and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network. Spatial attention is designed from the facial landmarks since facial expressions depend on the actions of key regions (eyebrows, eyes, nose, and mouth) on the face. Focusing on these key regions can help to decrease the effect of person-specific attributes. Meanwhile, the temporal attention is applied to automatically select the peak of expressions and aggregate the video-level representation. Our proposed CAN achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the three most widely used facial expression datasets: CK+ (99.03%), Oulu-CASIA (88.33%), and MMI (83.55%). Moreover, we conduct an extended experiment on a much more complex wild dataset AFEW and the experimental results further verify the generality of our attention mechanisms.

AB Rhythmically bursting neurons are fundamental to neuronal network function but typically are not considered in the context of primary sensory signaling. We now report intrinsically bursting lobster primary olfactory receptor neurons that respond to odors with a phase-dependent burst of action potentials. Rhythmic odor input as might be generated by sniffing entrains the intrinsic bursting rhythm in a concentration-dependent manner and presumably synchronizes the ensemble of bursting cells. We suggest such intrinsically bursting olfactory receptor cells provide a novel way for encoding odor information.

AB Clinical documentation in electronic health records contains crucial narratives and details about patients and their care. Natural language processing (NLP) can unlock the information conveyed in clinical notes and reports, and thus plays a critical role in real-world studies. The NLP Working Group at the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) consortium was established to develop methods and tools to promote the use of textual data and NLP in real-world observational studies. In this paper, we describe a framework for repre-senting and utilizing textual data in real-world evidence generation, including representations of information from clinical text in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM), the workflow and tools that were developed to extract, transform and load (ETL) data from clinical notes into tables in OMOP CDM, as well as current applications and specific use cases of the proposed OHDSI NLP solution at large consortia and individual institutions with English textual data. Challenges faced and lessons learned during the process are also discussed to provide valuable insights for researchers who are planning to implement NLP so-lutions in real-world studies.

AB This study investigated indoor air quality (IAQ) and its association with building characteristics and environmental factors in eleven different campus buildings in Gainesville, Florida. Integrated indoor and outdoor sensor systems are built and installed to measure the levels of airborne particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O-3), relative humidity (RH), and temperature continuously in 10 min intervals for two weeks for each case building. Twenty building-related characteristics were collected through a walkthrough-based survey, HVAC historical data, and construction drawings. Through these data, a PCA-assisted Levenberg-Marquardt Backpropagation (LMBP) neural network model was developed for rapidly and accurately analyzing and predicting the interaction between IAQ and its affecting factors. Factors with significant contributions to indoor exposure were may mostly be determined by outdoor sources. This is evidenced by the strong associations that were found between indoor PM((2.5-10)) and O-3 values and their corresponding outdoor values and factors, including distance from the major traffic (DFMT), cracks occurring, outdoor temperature, and humidity. Indoor NO2 concentrations were affected by DFMT, indoor O-3, indoor RH, number of air grilles, room volume, and window-to-wall ratio. Also, the comparison shows that the PCA-LMBP model outperforms the traditional BP-ANN and multi-linear regression methods. The average values of 1.34, 2.53, and 4.86 were obtained for the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of PCA-LMBP, BP-ANN, and MLR models, respectively. These results can be accordingly referred for the follow-up studies that analyze IAQ in similar building and environmental conditions.

TI nQuire: a statistical framework for ploidy estimation using next
   generation sequencing
SO BMC BIOINFORMATICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Ploidy; Probabilistic modeling; Next generation sequencing
ID ADAPTATION
AB Background: Intraspecific variation in ploidy occurs in a wide range of species including pathogenic and nonpathogenic eukaryotes such as yeasts and oomycetes. Ploidy can be inferred indirectly-without measuring DNA content-from experiments using next-generation sequencing (NGS). We present nQuire, a statistical framework that distinguishes between diploids, triploids and tetraploids using NGS. The command-line tool models the distribution of base frequencies at variable sites using a Gaussian Mixture Model, and uses maximum likelihood to select the most plausible ploidy model. nQuire handles large genomes at high coverage efficiently and uses standard input file formats.
   Results: We demonstrate the utility of nQuire analyzing individual samples of the pathogenic oomycete Phytophthora infestans and the Baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using these organisms we show the dependence between reliability of the ploidy assignment and sequencing depth. Additionally, we employ normalized maximized log-likelihoods generated by nQuire to ascertain ploidy level in a population of samples with ploidy heterogeneity. Using these normalized values we cluster samples in three dimensions using multivariate Gaussian mixtures. The cluster assignments retrieved from a S. cerevisiae population recovered the true ploidy level in over 96% of samples. Finally, we show that nQuire can be used regionally to identify chromosomal aneuploidies.
   Conclusions: nQuire provides a statistical framework to study organisms with intraspecific variation in ploidy. nQuire is likely to be useful in epidemiological studies of pathogens, artificial selection experiments, and for historical or ancient samples where intact nuclei are not preserved. It is implemented as a stand-alone Linux command line tool in the C programming language and is available at https://github.com/clwgg/nQuire under the MIT license.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS

ID MODELS
AB Models of human control strategy (HCS), which accurately emulate dynamic human behavior. have far reaching potential in areas ranging from robotics to virtual reality to the intelligent vehicle highway project. A number of learning algorithms, including fuzzy logic, neural networks, and locally weighted regression exist for modeling continuous human control strategies. These algorithms, however, may not be well suited for modeling discontinuous human control strategies. Therefore, we propose a new stochastic, discontinuous modeling framework, for abstracting human control strategies, based on hidden Markov models (HMM). In this paper, we first describe the real-time driving simulator which we developed for investigating human control strategies. Next, we demonstrate the shortcomings of a typical continuous modeling approach in modeling discontinuous human control strategies. We then propose an HMM-based method for modeling discontinuous human control strategies. The proposed controller overcomes these shortcomings and demonstrates greater fidelity to the human training data. We conclude the paper with further comparisons between the two competing modeling approaches and we propose avenues for future research. (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

TI A van der Waals interfacial junction transistor for reconfigurable fuzzy

AB Edge devices face challenges when implementing deep neural networks due to constraints on their computational resources and power consumption. Fuzzy logic systems can potentially provide more efficient edge implementations due to their compactness and capacity to manage uncertain data. However, their hardware realization remains difficult, primarily because implementing reconfigurable membership function generators using conventional technologies requires high circuit complexity and power consumption. Here we report a multigate van der Waals interfacial junction transistor based on a molybdenum disulfide/graphene heterostructure that can generate tunable Gaussian-like and pi-shaped membership functions. By integrating these generators with peripheral circuits, we create a reconfigurable fuzzy controller hardware capable of nonlinear system control. This fuzzy logic system can also be integrated with a few-layer convolution neural network to form a fuzzy neural network with enhanced performance in image segmentation.
   An interfacial junction transistor based on a molybdenum disulfide/graphene heterostructure can generate tunable pi-shaped and Gaussian-like membership functions, allowing membership function generators for fuzzy logic systems to be implemented with low device count and energy cost.

AB Wild giant pandas, an endangered species exclusive to China, are a focus of conservation efforts. The behavior of giant pandas reflects their health conditions and activity capabilities, which play an important role in formulating and implementing conservation measures. Researching and developing efficient behavior recognition methods based on deep learning can significantly advance the study of wild giant panda behavior. This study introduces, for the first time, a transformer-based behavior recognition method termed PandaFormer, which employs time-spatial attention to analyze behavioral temporal patterns and estimate activity spaces. The method integrates advanced techniques such as cross-fusion recurrent time encoding and transformer modules, which handle both temporal dynamics and spatial relationships within panda behavior videos. First, we design crossfusion recurrent time encoding to represent the occurrence time of behaviors effectively. By leveraging the multimodal processing capability of the transformer, we input time and video tokens into the transformer module to explore the relation between behavior and occurrence time. Second, we introduce relative temporal weights between video frames to enable the model to learn sequential relationships. Finally, considering the fixed position of the camera during recording, we propose a spatial attention mechanism based on the estimation of the panda's activity area. To validate the effectiveness of the model, a video dataset of wild giant pandas, encompassing five typical behaviors, was constructed. The proposed method is evaluated on this video-level annotated dataset. It achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 92.25 % and a mean class precision of 91.19 %, surpassing state-of-the-art behavior recognition algorithms by a large margin. Furthermore, the ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed temporal and spatial attention mechanisms. In conclusion, the proposed method offers an effective way of studying panda behavior and holds potential for application to other wildlife species.

AB Background. Two thirds of stroke survivors experience motor impairment resulting in long-term disability. The anatomical substrate is often the disruption of cortico-subcortical pathways. It has been proposed that reestablishment of cortico-subcortical communication relates to functional recovery. Objective. In this study, we applied a novel training protocol to augment ipsilesional cortico-subcortical connectivity after stroke. Chronic stroke patients with severe motor impairment were provided online feedback of blood-oxygenation level dependent signal connectivity between cortical and subcortical regions critical for motor function using real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging neurofeedback. Results. In this proof of principle study, 3 out of 4 patients learned to voluntarily modulate cortico-subcortical connectivity as intended. Conclusions. Our results document for the first time the feasibility and safety for patients with chronic stroke and severe motor impairment to self-regulate and augment ipsilesional cortico-subcortical connectivity through neurofeedback using real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging.

AB Pathology tissue slides are taken as the gold standard for the diagnosis of most cancer diseases. Automatic pathology slide diagnosis is still a challenging task for researchers because of the high-resolution, significant morphological variation, and ambiguity between malignant and benign regions in whole slide images (WSIs). In this study, we introduce a general framework to automatically diagnose different types of WSIs via unit stochastic selection and attention fusion. For example, a unit can denote a patch in a histopathology slide or a cell in a cytopathology slide. To be specific, we first train a unit-level convolutional neural network (CNN) to perform two tasks: constructing feature extractors for the units and for estimating a unit's non-benign probability. Then we use our novel stochastic selection algorithm to choose a small subset of units that are most likely to be non-benign, referred to as the Units Of Interest (UOI), as determined by CNN. Next, we use the attention mechanism to fuse the representations of the UOI to form a fixed-length descriptor for the WSI's diagnosis. We evaluate the proposed framework on three datasets: histological thyroid frozen sections, histological colonoscopy tissue slides, and cytological cervical pap smear slides. The framework achieves diagnosis accuracies higher than 0.8 and AUC values higher than 0.85 in all three applications. Experiments demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of the proposed framework and its potentiality for clinical applications. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: Technology has substantial potential to transform and extend care for persons with chronic pain, a burdensome and costly condition. To catalyze the development of impactful applications of technology in this space, we developed the Pain Tech Landscape (PTL) model, which integrates pain care needs with characteristics of technological solutions. Methods: Our interdisciplinary group representing experts in pain and human factors research developed PTL through iterative discussions. To demonstrate one potential use of the model, we apply data generated from a narrative review of selected pain and technology journals (2000-2020) in the form of heat map overlays, to reveal where pain tech research attention has focused to date. Results: The PTL comprises three two-dimensional planes, with pain care needs on each x axis (measurement to management) and technology applications on the y axes according to a) user agency (user- to system-driven), b) usage time frame (temporary to lifelong), and c) collaboration (single-user to collaborative). Heat maps show that existing applications reside primarily in the "user-driven/management" quadrant (e.g., self-care apps). Examples of less developed areas include artificial intelligence and Internet of Things (i.e., Internet-linked household objects), and collaborative/social tools for pain management. Conclusions: Collaborative development between the pain and tech fields in early developmental stages using the PTL as a common language could yield impactful solutions for chronic pain management. The PTL could also be used to track developments in the field over time. We encourage periodic reassessment and refinement of the PTL model, which can also be adapted to other chronic conditions.

High-throughput sequencing is a promising option for clinical point-of-care and ecological surveillance, opening the opportunity to develop genotyping-based AMR determination as a possibly faster alternative to phenotypic testing. In the present work, we compare the performance of state-of-the-art methods for detection of AMR using high-throughput sequencing data from clinical settings. We consider five computational approaches based on alignment (AMRPlusPlus), deep learning (DeepARG), k-mer genomic signatures (KARGA, ResFinder) or hidden Markov models (Meta-MARC). We use an extensive collection of 585 isolates with available AMR resistance profiles determined by phenotypic tests across nine antibiotic classes. We show how the prediction landscape of AMR classifiers is highly heterogeneous, with balanced accuracy varying from 0.40 to 0.92. Although some algorithms-ResFinder, KARGA and AMRPlusPlus-exhibit overall better balanced accuracy than others, the high per-AMR-class variance and related findings suggest that: (1) all algorithms might be subject to sampling bias both in data repositories used for training and experimental/clinical settings; and (2) a portion of clinical samples might contain uncharacterized AMR genes that the algorithms-mostly trained on known AMR genes-fail to generalize upon. These results lead us to formulate practical advice for software configuration and application, and give suggestions for future study designs to further develop AMR prediction tools from proof-of-concept to bedside.

AB Recent advances in high-throughput biotechnologies have provided an unprecedented opportunity for biomarker discovery, which, from a statistical point of view, can be cast as a variable selection problem. This problem is challenging due to the high-dimensional and nonlinear nature of omics data and, in general, it suffers three difficulties: (i) an unknown functional form of the nonlinear system, (ii) variable selection consistency, and (iii) high-demanding computation. To circumvent the first difficulty, we employ a feed-forward neural network to approximate the unknown nonlinear function motivated by its universal approximation ability. To circumvent the second difficulty, we conduct structure selection for the neural network, which induces variable selection, by choosing appropriate prior distributions that lead to the consistency of variable selection. To circumvent the third difficulty, we implement the population stochastic approximation Monte Carlo algorithm, a parallel adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, on the OpenMP platform that provides a linear speedup for the simulation with the number of cores of the computer. The numerical results indicate that the proposed method can work very well for identification of relevant variables for high-dimensional nonlinear systems. The proposed method is successfully applied to identification of the genes that are associated with anticancer drug sensitivities based on the data collected in the cancer cell line encyclopedia study. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.

AB This work aims to estimate time-resolved velocity field that is directly associated with pressure fluctuations in a subsonic round jet. To achieve this goal, synchronous measurements of the velocity field and in-flow pressure fluctuations were performed at Mach number 0.3. Two different experiment campaigns were conducted: the first experimental campaign aims to explore the time-resolved dynamics of the axisymmetric velocity components, and the second experiment focuses on the time-resolved, two-dimensional velocity estimates on a streamwise plane. Two different methods were utilized to estimate the input-output relation between velocity and in-flow pressure measurements. A hybrid approach based on the spectral linear stochastic estimation and the proper orthogonal decomposition was applied to set up the model in a linear manner, and a wavelet-based filter was implemented to attenuate the noise level in the cross-correlation functions. In addition, the pressure-velocity relationship was also described by neural network architectures based on the multilayer perceptron (MLP) and bidirectional long-short-term memory (LSTM). In both experimental sets, pressure fluctuations inside the flow are found to be connected to the streamwise convection of large-scale coherent structures in the flow. A unique advantage of the bidirectional LSTM method was found among all estimation schemes and is also reported in this work. The estimation result represents the space-time dynamics of the turbulent structures that are linked to the pressure wave packets in the flow, and it is of great importance to understand the noise generation mechanism.

ID ASYMPTOTIC TRACKING; SYSTEMS
AB A position tracking control system is developed for a rotorcraft-based unmanned aerial vehicle (RUAV) using robust integral of the signum of the error (RISE) feedback and neural network (NN) feedforward terms. While the typical NN-based adaptive controller guarantees uniformly ultimately bounded stability, the proposed NN-based adaptive control system guarantees semi-global asymptotic tracking of the RUAV using the RISE feedback control. The developed control system consists of an inner-loop and outer-loop. The inner-loop control system determines the attitude of the RUAV based on an adaptive NN-based linear dynamic model inversion (LDI) method with the RISE feedback. The outer-loop control system generates the attitude reference corresponding to the given position, velocity, and heading references, and controls the altitude of the RUAV by the LDI method with the RISE feedback. The linear model for the LDI is obtained by a linearization of the nonlinear RUAV dynamics during hover flight. Asymptotic tracking of the attitude and altitude states is proven by a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, and a numerical simulation is performed on the nonlinear RUAV model to validate the effectiveness of the controller.

TI Object-Detection from Multi-View remote sensing Images: A case study of
   fruit and flower detection and counting on a central Florida strawberry
   farm
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Remote sensing; Deep learning; Strawberry fruit detection
AB Object detection in remote sensing images is one of the most critical computer vision tasks for various earth observation applications. Previous studies applied object detection models to orthomosaic images generated from the SfM (Structure-from-Motion) analysis to perform object detection and counting. However, some small objects that are occluded from the vertical view but observable in raw images from the oblique views cannot be detected in the orthomosaic image, leading to an occlusion issue that cannot be resolved with the traditional orthophoto-based approach. Taking strawberry detection as a case study, the objective of this study is to detect small objects directly from multi-view raw images. Firstly, an object-detection model (Faster R-CNN in this study) was applied to each raw image to identify strawberry fruit and flower objects. Each unique strawberry object on the ground can be detected multiple times in the raw images because images have forward- and side overlap. To find the unique objects from the step one detection results, an improved FaceNet model was proposed to combine the image and position information to calculate the feature distance between those objects, and a clustering algorithm was used to associate the cluster with each unique strawberry using the object distance output from the FaceNet model, from which the final position and number of strawberry fruits and flowers were obtained. Compared with the orthomosaic image alone, this approach using multi-view images effectively solved the occlusion problem and improved overall recognition accuracy of strawberry flowers, unripe fruits, and ripe fruits from 76.28% to 96.98%, 71.64% to 99.09%, and 69.81% to 97.17%, respectively, highlighting the potential of multi-view stereovision (MVS) in small object detection.

AB A study on vertical variation of PM2.5 concentrations was carried out in this paper. Field measurements were conducted at eight different floor heights outside a building alongside a typical elevated expressway in downtown Shanghai, China. Results show that PM2.5 concentration decreases significantly with the increase of height from the 3rd to 7th floor or the 8th to 15th floor, and increases suddenly from the 7th to 8th floor which is the same height as the elevated expressway. A non-parametric test indicates that the data of PM2.5 concentration is statistically different under the 7th floor and above the 8th floor at the 5% significance level. To investigate the relationships between PM2.5 concentration and influencing factors, the Pearson correlation analysis was performed and the results indicate that both traffic and meteorological factors have crucial impacts on the variation of PM2.5 concentration, but there is a rather large variation in correlation coefficients under the 7th floor and above the 8th floor. Furthermore, the back propagation neural network based on principal component analysis (PCA-BPNN), as well as generalized additive model (GAM), was applied to predict the vertical PM2.5 concentration and examined with the field measurement dataset. Experimental results indicated that both models can obtain accurate predictions, while PCA-BPNN model provides more reliable and accurate predictions as it can reduce the complexity and eliminate data co-linearity. These findings reveal the vertical distribution of PM2.5 concentration and the potential of the proposed model to be applicable to predict the vertical trends of air pollution in similar situations.

AB Researchers are rapidly developing and deploying highly portable MRI technology to conduct field-based research. The new technology will widen access to include new investigators in remote and unconventional settings and will facilitate greater inclusion of rural, economically disadvantaged, and historically underrepresented populations. To address the ethical, legal, and societal issues raised by highly accessible and portable MRI, an interdisciplinary Working Group (WG) engaged in a multi-year structured process of analysis and consensus building, informed by empirical research on the perspectives of experts and the general public. This article presents the WG's consensus recommendations. These recommendations address technology quality control, design and oversight of research, including safety of research participants and others in the scanning environment, engagement of diverse participants, therapeutic misconception, use of artificial intelligence algorithms to acquire and analyze MRI data, data privacy and security, return of results and managing incidental findings, and research participant data access and control.

ID RELIABILITY
AB Background: The nasolabial fold (NLF) greatly contributes to facial aesthetics; changes to NLF depth and vector are disfiguring in patients with facial paralysis (FP). NLF parameters are integral to clinician-graded outcomes, but automated programs currently lack NLF identification capabilities.Objective: To incorporate an automated NLF identification and quantification function into the facial landmark program, Emotrics, and to compare new Emotrics-derived NLF data to clinician-graded electronic facial paralysis assessment (eFACE) data for accuracy.Methods: Photographs of 135 patients with FP were marked bilaterally, using identification markers manually placed on each NLF. A machine learning model was trained to automatically localize the markers using these data. Once Emotrics accurately identified the NLF and its corresponding vector, photographs of 20 additional patients who underwent facial reanimation procedures were assessed by the algorithm.Results: The enhanced Emotrics algorithm successfully identified the NLF, and measured the vector from midline, in a series of patients with FP. NLF vector data closely matched corresponding eFACE parameters. Furthermore, changes in NLF presence and vector were detected following facial reanimation procedures.Conclusion: The Emotrics program now provides critical NLF data, providing objective parameters for clinicians interested in changing NLF dynamics after FP.

AB Most surgical procedures require general anesthesia, which is a reversible deep sedation state lacking all perception. The induction of this state is possible because of complex molecular and neuronal network actions of general anesthetics (GAs) and other pharmacological agents. Laboratory and clinical studies indicate that the effects of GAs may not be completely reversible upon anesthesia withdrawal. The long-term neurocognitive effects of GAs, especially when administered at the extremes of ages, are an increasingly recognized health concern and the subject of extensive laboratory and clinical research. Initial studies in rodents suggest that the adverse effects of GAs, whose actions involve enhancement of GABA type A receptor activity (GABAergic GAs), can also extend to future unexposed offspring. Importantly, experimental findings show that GABAergic GAs may induce heritable effects when administered from the early postnatal period to at least young adulthood, covering nearly all age groups that may have children after exposure to anesthesia. More studies are needed to understand when and how the clinical use of GAs in a large and growing population of patients can result in lower resilience to diseases in the even larger population of their unexposed offspring. This minireview is focused on the authors' published results and data in the literature supporting the notion that GABAergic GAs, in particular sevoflurane, may upregulate systemic levels of stress and sex steroids and alter expressions of genes that are essential for the functioning of these steroid systems. The authors hypothesize that stress and sex steroids are involved in the mediation of sex-specific heritable effects of sevoflurane.

AB In-situ infrared soil spectroscopy is prone to the effects of ambient factors, such as moisture, shadows, or roughness, resulting in measurements of compromised quality, which is amplified when multiple sensors are used for data collection. Aiming to provide accurate estimations of common physicochemical soil properties, such as soil organic carbon (SOC), texture, pH, and calcium carbonates based on in-situ reflectance captured by a set of low-cost spectrometers operating at the shortwave infrared region, we developed an AI-based spectral transfer function that maps fields to laboratory spectra. Three test sites in Cyprus, Lithuania, and Greece were used to evaluate the proposed methodology, while the dataset was harmonized and augmented by GEO-Cradle regional soil spectral library (SSL). The developed dataset was used to calibrate and validate machine learning models, with the attained predictive performance shown to be promising for directly estimating soil properties in-situ, even with sensors with reduced spectral range. Aiming to set a baseline scenario, we completed the exact same modeling experiment under laboratory conditions and performed a one-to-one comparison between field and laboratory modelling accuracy metrics. SOC and pH presented an R-2 of 0.43 and 0.32 when modeling the in-situ data compared to 0.63 and 0.41 of the laboratory case, respectively, while clay demonstrated the highest accuracy with an R-2 value of 0.87 in-situ and 0.90 in the laboratory. Calcium carbonates were also attempted to be modeled at the studied spectral region, with the expected accuracy loss from the laboratory to the in-situ to be observable (R-2 = 0.89 for the laboratory and 0.67 for the in-situ) but the reduced dataset variability combined with the calcium carbonate characteristics that are spectrally active in the region outside the spectral range of the used in-situ sensor, induced low RPIQ values (less than 0.50), signifying the importance of the suitable sensor selection.

AB Background: Greater brain network integrity may associate with physically active lifestyles. Three resting state networks may provide unique insights into known physical activity-mediated brain health benefits: the default mode network (involved with self-monitoring), the salience network (involved in orienting oneself to salient external and internal stimuli), and the central executive network (responsible for higher level cognitive task). The current study explored relationships between system-wide neural network integrity measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging and objectively-measured physical activity. We hypothesize connectivity patterns as measured by fMRI networks will relate to actigraphy markers such that 1) there will be higher connectivity within the central executive network in more physically active individuals, and 2) there will be higher connectivity within the default mode network and salience network in those with higher levels of physical activity. Methods: Eighteen non-demented older adults with orthopedic pain (age 67.11 +/- 5.61, 50% female, education 15.94 +/- 2.51 years) completed brain magnetic resonance imaging, and wore an actigraphy device to objectively measure types of physical and sedentary engagement. Results: Results showed a negative relationship between central executive network connectivity and sedentary time (13 =-0.108, p = .039), and a positive relationship with both moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (13 = 0.629, p = .029) and total activity time (13 = 0.645, p = .039). Results also showed positive relationships for the default mode network (13 = 0.588, p = .033) and the salience network (13 = 0.608, p = .037) with mean cadence (i.e. steps per minute). Conclusions: Our work adds to the existing literature on specific types of activity measurement (i.e. sedentary time, cadence and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity) which will be useful for interventions aimed at improving the integrity of underlying neural networks.

AB Toll stations are traffic-related pollution hotspots, but the contribution of various factors to pollutant distributions has not been clearly recognized. This study conducted a field investigation of the spatiotemporal variations of pollutants on different lanes at a toll station in Shanghai, China. Quantitative analysis showed that the concentrations of black carbon (BC) and fine particles (PM2.5) on the manual toll collection (MTC) lane were higher than those on the electronic toll collection (ETC) lane, and higher concentrations were identified on weekdays. Furthermore, the study introduced interaction terms between lane type and traffic conditions while constructing generalized additive models (GAMs) to reveal the internal relationship between concentrations and explanatory variables. The results of GAM analysis showed that the coupling effect of traffic volume and lane type was the most important force driving variations in BC, while background concentration was the dominant factor of PM2.5 variations. The Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) models were developed to separately evaluate the influence of lane type and traffic volume on BC and PM2.5, indicating that lane type contributed 29.4% and 36.5% of BC and PM2.5 variations respectively. Additionally, simulation demonstrated that in contrast to MTC, ETC can reduce BC pollution by 25.2% under the same traffic conditions. Finally, the respiratory deposition dose was used to compare the negative consequences of exposure between the ETC and MTC lane. This study revealed the general variation trends of pollutants and corresponding influencing factors at a toll station, and could provide implications for mitigating traffic-related pollution.

AB In environmental soil-landscape modeling (ESLM), the selection of predictive variables is commonly contingent on the researchers' domain expertise on soil environment processes. This variable selection strategy may suffer bias or even fail in regions where the process knowledge is insufficient. To overcome this problem, this study demonstrates a holistic ESLM framework which consists of five components: model conceptualization, data compilation, process identification, parsimonious model calibration, and model validation. Based on the STEP-AWBH conceptual model, a comprehensive pool of 210 potential environmental variables that exhaustively cover pedogenic and environmental factors was constructed. This was followed by strategic variable selection and development of parsimonious prediction models using machine learning techniques. The all-relevant variable selection successfully identified the major and minor factors relevant to the SOC variation, showing that the major factors important for explaining SOC variation in Florida were vegetation and soil water gradient. Topography and climate showed moderate effects on SOC variation. Parsimonious SOC models developed using four minimal-optimal variable selection techniques and simulated annealing yielded optimal predictive performance with minimal model complexity. The holistic ESLM framework not only provides a new view of selecting and utilizing variables for predicting soil properties but can also assist in identifying the underlying processes of soil-environment systems of interest. Due to the flexibility of the framework to incorporate various types of variable selection and modeling techniques, the holistic environmental modeling strategy can be generalized to other environmental modeling domains for both prediction and process identification.

AB With the promotion of carbon neutrality, it is also important to synchronously promote the assessment and sustainable management of chemicals so as to protect public health. Humans and animals are possibly exposed to endocrine disruptors that have inhibitory effects on thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR). As such, it is important to identify chemicals that inhibit TSHR and to develop models to predict their inhibitory activity. In this study, 5952 compounds derived from a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) analysis, a key signaling pathway in thyrocytes, were used to establish a binary classification model comparing methods that included random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and logistic regression (LR). The prediction model based on RF showed the highest identification accuracy for revealing chemicals that may inhibit TSHR. For the RF model, recall was calculated at 0.89, balance accuracy was 0.85, and its receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve-area under (AUC) was 0.92, indicating that the model had very high predictive capacity. The lowest CDocker energy (CE) and CDocker interaction energy (CIE) for chemicals and TSHR were determined and were subsequently introduced into the predictive model as descriptors. A regression model, extreme gradient boostingRegression (XGBR), was successfully established yielding an R2 = 0.65 to predict inhibitory activity for active compounds. Parameters that included dissociation characteristics, molecular structure, and binding energy were all key factors in the predictive model. We demonstrate that QSAR models are useful approaches, not only for identifying chemicals that inhibit TSHR, but for predicting inhibitory activity of active compounds.

AB Introduction: Topiramate (TPM), a frequently prescribed antiseizure medication, can cause severe cognitive side-effects. Though these side-effects have been studied behaviorally, the underlying neural mechanisms are unknown. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study of TPM's impact on cognition, nine healthy volunteers completed three study sessions: a no-drug baseline session and two sessions during which they received either TPM or placebo. Electroencephalogram was recorded during each session while subjects performed a working-memory task with three memory-loads.Results: Comparing TPM with baseline we found the following results. (a) TPM administration led to declines in behavioral performance. (b) Fronto-central event-related potentials (ERP) elicited by probe stimuli, representing the primary task network activity, showed strong memory-load modulations at baseline, but the magnitude of these load-dependent modulations was significantly reduced during TPM session, suggesting drug-induced impairments of the primary task network. (c) ERP responses over bilateral fronto-temporal electrodes, which were not load sensitive at baseline, showed significant memory-load modulations after TPM administration, suggesting the drug-related recruitment of additional neural resources. (d) At fronto-central scalp sites, there was significant increase in response amplitude for low memory-load during TPM session compared to baseline, and the amplitude increase was dependent on TPM plasma concentration, suggesting that the primary task network became less efficient under TPM impact. (e) At bilateral fronto-temporal electrodes, there were no ERP differences when comparing low memory-load trials, but TPM administration led to an increase in ERP responses to high load, the magnitude of which was positively correlated with task performance, suggesting that the recruited neural resources were beneficial for task performance. Placebo-TPM comparison yielded similar effects albeit with generally reduced significance and effect sizes.Conclusion: Our findings support the hypothesis that TPM impairs the primary task network by reducing its efficiency, which triggers compensatory recruitment of additional resources to maintain task performance.

AB This study provides a novel approach to individual tree crown delineation (ITCD) using airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data in dense natural forests using two main steps: crown boundary refinement based on a proposed Fishing Net Dragging (FiND) method, and segment merging based on boundary classification. FIND starts with approximate tree crown boundaries derived using a traditional watershed method with Gaussian filtering and refines these boundaries using an algorithm that mimics how a fisherman drags a fishing net. Random forest machine learning is then used to classify boundary segments into two classes: boundaries between trees and boundaries between branches that belong to a single tree. Three groups of LiDAR-derived features two from the pseudo waveform generated along with crown boundaries and one from a canopy height model (CHM) were used in the classification. The proposed ITCD approach was tested using LiDAR data collected over a mountainous region in the Adirondack Park, NY, USA. Overall accuracy of boundary classification was 82.4%. Features derived from the CHM were generally more important in the classification than the features extracted from the pseudo waveform. A comprehensive accuracy assessment scheme for ITCD was also introduced by considering both area of crown overlap and crown centroids. Accuracy assessment using this new scheme shows the proposed ITCD achieved 74% and 78% as overall accuracy, respectively, for deciduous and mixed forest.

AB Diet and exercise are known to influence mental health. However, the interaction between diet, dietary practices, and exercise and its impact on the mood of young adults (YA) is poorly understood. YA are inherently at risk for mental distress. They tend to consume a low-quality diet and are generally active. The purpose of the study was to assess these relationships through validating causal loop diagrams (CLD) that describe these connections by using a system dynamic (SD) modeling methodology. Adults 18-29 years were invited to complete the Food-Mood questionnaire. The anonymous questionnaire link was distributed to several institutional listservs and via several social media platforms targeting young adults. A multi-level analysis, including machine learning techniques, was used to assess these relationships. The key findings were then built into gender based CLD, which suggest that a differential repertoire may be needed to optimize diet quality, exercise, and mental well-being. Additionally, a potential net threshold for dietary factors and exercise may be needed to achieve mental well-being in young adults. Moreover, our findings suggest that exercise may boost the enhancing effect of food groups on mental well-being and may lessen the negative impact of dietary impediments of mental well-being.

DT Article

AB Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly malignant and devastating brain cancer characterized by its ability to rapidly and aggressively grow, infiltrating brain tissue, with nearly universal recurrence after the standard of care (SOC), which comprises maximal safe resection followed by chemoirradiation (CRT). The metabolic triggers leading to the reprogramming of tumor behavior and resistance are an area increasingly studied in relation to the tumor molecular features associated with outcome. There are currently no metabolomic biomarkers for GBM. Studying the metabolomic alterations in GBM patients undergoing CRT could uncover the biochemical pathways involved in tumor response and resistance, leading to the identification of novel biomarkers and the optimization of the treatment response. The feature selection process identifies key factors to improve the model's accuracy and interpretability. This study utilizes a combined feature selection approach, incorporating both Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and Minimum Redundancy-Maximum Relevance (mRMR), alongside a rank-based weighting method (i.e., MetaWise) to link metabolomic biomarkers to CRT and the 12-month and 20-month overall survival (OS) status in patients with GBM. Our method shows promising results, reducing feature dimensionality when employed on serum-based large-scale metabolomic datasets (University of Florida) for all our analyses. The proposed method successfully identified a set of eleven serum biomarkers shared among three datasets. The computational results show that the utilized method achieves 96.711%, 92.093%, and 86.910% accuracy rates with 48, 46, and 33 selected features for the CRT, 12-month, and 20-month OS-based metabolomic datasets, respectively. This discovery has implications for developing personalized treatment plans and improving patient outcomes.

AB Objectives: Maternal stress has long been associated with lower birthweight, which is associated with adverse health outcomes including many adult diseases. The underlying mechanisms remain elusive although changes in gene expression may play a role. Studies are only beginning to test how maternal stress impacts gene expression as reflected in the transcriptome.
   Materials and Methods: In a cohort of mothers and newborns in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (n = 93), we studied the effects of four maternal stress measures (chronic stress, war trauma, sexual trauma, and general trauma) on the transcriptomes of maternal venous blood, newborn venous blood, and placental tissues, and on newborn birthweight. Maternal stress was investigated as independent measures, principal components, and clusters identified through machine learning. The transcriptome was assayed using the ClariomD chip. Multiple regression models were used to test for associations between maternal stress measures, the transcriptome, and newborn birthweight.
   Results: None of the maternal stress measures showed an association with the expression of individual genes. In contrast, when testing global gene expression, war trauma was significantly associated with the placental transcriptome. War trauma was also significantly associated with birthweight in multiple models. Mediation analysis indicated that similar to 14% of the effect of war trauma on birthweight was mediated by a placental gene expression component.
   Discussion: Our results suggest that gene expression in the placenta, which represents the interface between mother and developing fetus, may partially mediate the negative impact of maternal stress on newborn birthweight.

AB ObjectivesFalls are the leading cause of non-fatal injury among young children. The aim of this study was to identify and quantify the circumstances contributing to medically attended paediatric fall injuries among 0-4 years old. MethodsCross-sectional data for falls among kids under 5 years recorded between 2012 and 2016 in the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System was obtained. A sample of 4546 narratives was manually coded for: (1) where the child fell from; (2) what the child fell onto; (3) the activities preceding the fall and (4) how the fall occurred. A natural language processing model was developed and subsequently applied to the remaining uncoded data to yield a set of 91 325 cases coded for what the child fell from, fell onto, the activities preceding the fall, and how the fall occurred. Data were descriptively tabulated by age and disposition. ResultsChildren most often fell from the bed accounting for one-third (33%) of fall injuries in infants, 13% in toddlers and 12% in preschoolers. Children were more likely to be hospitalised if they fell from another person (7.4% vs 2.6% for all other sources; p<0.01). After adjusting for age, the odds of a child being hospitalised following a fall from another person were 2.1 times higher than falling from other surfaces (95% CI 1.6 to 2.7). ConclusionsThe prevalence of injuries due to falling off the bed, and the elevated risk of serious injury from falling from another person highlights the need for more robust and effective communication to caregivers on fall injury prevention.

AB Corneal biomechanics has been a hot topic for research in contemporary ophthalmology due to its prospective applications in diagnosis, management, and treatment of several clinical conditions, including glaucoma, elective keratorefractive surgery, and different corneal diseases. The clinical biomechanical investigation has become of great importance in the setting of refractive surgery to identify patients at higher risk of developing iatrogenic ectasia after laser vision correction. This review discusses the latest developments in the detection of corneal ectatic diseases. These developments should be considered in conjunction with multimodal corneal and refractive imaging, including Placido-disk based corneal topography, Scheimpflug corneal tomography, anterior segment tomography, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), very-high-frequency ultrasound (VHF-US), ocular biometry, and ocular wavefront measurements. The ocular response analyzer (ORA) and the Corvis ST are non-contact tonometry systems that provide a clinical corneal biomechanical assessment. More recently, Brillouin optical microscopy has been demonstrated to provide in vivo biomechanical measurements. The integration of tomographic and biomechanical data into artificial intelligence techniques has demonstrated the ability to increase the accuracy to detect ectatic disease and characterize the inherent susceptibility for biomechanical failure and ectasia progression, which is a severe complication after laser vision correction.

AB We propose an efficient method to determine the micro-structural entropic behavior of polymer chains directly from a sufficiently rich non-homogeneous experiment at the continuum scale. The procedure is developed in 2 stages: First, a Macro-Micro-Macro approach; second, a finite element method. Thus, we no longer require the typical stress-strain curves from standard homogeneous tests, but we use instead the applied/reaction forces and the displacement field obtained, for example, from Digital Image Correlation. The approach is based on the P-spline local approximation of the constituents behavior at the micro-scale (a priori unknown). The sought spline vertices determining the polymer behavior are first pushed up from the micro-scale to the integration point of the finite element, and then from the integration point to the element forces. The polymer chain behavior is then obtained immediately by solving a linear system of equations which results from a least squares minimization error, resulting in an inverse problem which crosses material scales. The result is physically interpretable and directly linked to the micro-structure of the material, and the resulting polymer behavior may be employed in any other finite element simulation. We give some demonstrative examples (academic and from actual polymers) in which we demonstrate that we are capable of recovering "unknown" analytical models and spline-based constitutive behavior previously obtained from homogeneous tests.

AB In this study, we investigate whether individual variability in the rate of visuomotor adaptation and multiday savings is associated with differences in regional gray matter volume and resting-state functional connectivity. Thirty-four participants performed a manual adaptation task during two separate test sessions, on average 9 days apart. Functional connectivity strength between sensorimotor, dorsal cingulate, and temporoparietal regions of the brain was found to predict the rate of learning during the early phase of the adaptation task. In contrast, default mode network connectivity strength was found to predict both the rate of learning during the late adaptation phase and savings. As for structural predictors, greater gray matter volume in temporoparietal and occipital regions predicted faster early learning, whereas greater gray matter volume in superior posterior regions of the cerebellum predicted faster late learning. These findings suggest that the offline neural predictors of early adaptation may facilitate the cognitive aspects of sensorimotor adaptation, supported by the involvement of temporoparietal and cingulate networks. The offline neural predictors of late adaptation and savings, including the default mode network and the cerebellum, likely support the storage and modification of newly acquired sensorimotor representations.

DE Federated learning (FL); language modeling; natural language processing;
   neural networks; privacy
AB Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively build a global learning model without sharing their own raw data for privacy protection. Unfortunately, recent research still found privacy leakage in FL, especially on image classification tasks, such as the reconstruction of class representatives. Nevertheless, such analysis on image classification tasks is not applicable to uncover the privacy threats against natural language processing (NLP) tasks, whose records composed of sequential texts cannot be grouped as class representatives. The finer (record-level) granularity in NLP tasks not only makes it more challenging to extract individual text records, but also exposes more serious threats. This article presents the first attempt to explore the record-level privacy leakage against NLP tasks in FL. We propose a framework to investigate the exposure of the records of interest in federated aggregations by leveraging the perplexity of language modeling. Through monitoring the exposure patterns, we propose two correlation attacks to identify the corresponding clients when extracting their specific records. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attacks. We have also examined several countermeasures and shown that they are ineffective to mitigate such attacks, and hence further research is expected.

AB A central topic in sensorimotor neuroscience is the static-dynamic dichotomy that exists throughout the nervous system. Previous work examining motor unit synchronization reports that the activation strategy and timing of motor units differ for static and dynamic tasks. However, it remains unclear whether segregated or overlapping blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activity exists in the brain for static and dynamic motor control. This study compared the neural circuits associated with the production of static force to those associated with the production of dynamic force pulses. To that end, healthy young adults (n = 17) completed static and dynamic precision grip force tasks during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Both tasks activated core regions within the visuomotor network, including primary and sensory motor cortices, premotor cortices, multiple visual areas, putamen, and cerebellum. Static force was associated with unique activity in a right-lateralized cortical network including inferior parietal lobe, ventral premotor cortex, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In contrast, dynamic force was associated with unique activity in left-lateralized and midline cortical regions, including supplementary motor area, superior parietal lobe, fusiform gyrus, and visual area V3. These findings provide the first neuroimaging evidence supporting a lateralized pattern of brain activity for the production of static and dynamic precision grip force. Hum Brain Mapp, 2013.

AB Dissolved chloride concentrations higher than seawater were observed over a broad depth range in pore water profiles from International Ocean Discovery Program Site U1517 on the Hikurangi Margin. This Cl maximum is not associated with an Sr-87/Sr-86 anomaly, indicating that it is not caused by hydration reactions during ash alteration. We use a numerical modeling approach to examine possible causes for recent gas hydrate formation that can result in the observed Cl high. Our approach considers sedimentation, sea level, and bottom water temperature (BWT) changes due to glaciation as drivers for the downward migration of the base of gas hydrate stability and gas hydrate formation. The modeling results reveal that lowering of sea level during glaciation can allow methane hydrate dissociation followed by postglacial hydrate formation as sea level rises. However, BWT cooling of 2 degrees C during glaciation followed by warming during deglaciation would mostly counteract the impacts of sea level change. Bottom water cooling during glaciation is expected in this region and many locations worldwide. As a result, our simulations do not support the previous hypotheses of large-scale gas hydrate dissociation due to sea level drop during glaciation, which have been proposed as triggers for widespread gas release and slope failure. Such a mechanism is only possible where BWT remains constant or increases during glaciation. Our simulations indicate that sedimentation constitutes the largest factor driving recent methane hydrate formation at Site U1517, and we suggest that sedimentation may play a larger role in gas hydrate dynamics along margins than previously recognized.
   Plain Language Summary Methane hydrate, which is a solid material/compound containing methane within frozen cages of water molecules, forms in continental margin sediments beneath the seafloor within a limited range of temperature and pressure. Researchers have previously suggested that sea level change during glaciations would allow methane hydrate to destabilize. This could free methane, cause slope failures, and affect Earth's climate. Drilling of sediments at a site offshore of New Zealand found evidence for recent trapping of methane as hydrate, and we investigate whether the hydrate formation is related to sea level changes associated with glaciation. We use computer models to test how methane hydrate storage would change through 400,000 years of variations in sea level and bottom water temperature. We find that expected water temperature changes during glacial cycles partially counteract the pressure effects of sea level changes. Rapid burial by sediment deposition appears to be the largest factor in storage and release of methane from hydrates at this site and perhaps at other continental margins worldwide.

AB Ample clinical reports and neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that the acupuncture has sustained effects after manipulation. However, most previous fMRI studies of acupuncture have paid little attention to this issue, only investigating on the manipulation effects. In the current study, we attempted to explore both acupuncture effects, which have positive influence to therapeutic efficiency, to reveal the neural mechanism of acupuncture. This paper combined the conventional general linear model (GLM) and independent component analysis (ICA) to study the topography and the temporal feature of brain activity to detect the brain responses to stimulation at ST36 (Zusanli) and a sham acupoint. The results showed that the manipulation-related effects and the sustained acupuncture effects separately induced statistically significant increases/decreases in the cortical-subcortical areas, including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), supplementary motor area (SMA) primary/secondary somatosensory cortex (SI/SII), occipital cortices and midbrain. Our findings suggested that the analgesia effects of ST36 integrated sophisticated physiological and psychological procedures. In addition, our results have shed light on methodology in acupuncture research. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We have demonstrated that the spike patterns of auditory cortical neurons carry information about sound-source location in azimuth. The question arises as to whether those units integrate the multiple acoustical cues that signal the location of a sound source or whether they merely demonstrate sensitivity to a specific parameter that covaries with sound-source azimuth, such as interaural level difference. We addressed that issue by testing the sensitivity of cortical neurons to sound locations in the median vertical plane, where interaural difference cues are negligible. Auditory unit responses were recorded from 14 alpha-chloralose-anesthetized cats. We studied 113 units in the anterior ectosylvian auditory area and 82 units in auditory area A2. Broadband noise stimuli were presented in an anechoic room from 14 locations in the vertical midline in 20 degrees steps, from 60 degrees below the front horizon, up and over the head, to 20 degrees below the rear horizon, as well as from 18 locations in the horizontal plane. The spike counts of most units showed fairly broad elevation tuning. An artificial neural network was used to recognize spike patterns, which contain both the number and timing of spikes, and thereby estimate the locations of sound sources in elevation. For each unit, the median error of neural-network estimates was used as a measure of the network performance. For all 195 units; the average of the median errors was 46.4 +/- 9.1 degrees (mean +/-: SD), compared with the expectation of 65 degrees based on chance performance. To address the question of whether sensitivity to sound pressure level (SPL)alone might account for the modest sensitivity to elevation of neurons, we measured SPLs from the cat's ear canal and compared the neural elevation sensitivity with the acoustical data. In many instances, the artificial neural network discriminated stimulus elevations even when the free-field sound produced identical SPLs in the ear canal. Conversely, two stimuli at the same elevation could produce the same network estimate of elevation, even when we varied sound-source SPL over a 20-dB range. There was a significant correlation between the accuracy of network performance in azimuth and in elevation. Most units that localized well in elevation also localized well in azimuth. Because the principal acoustic cues for localization in elevation differ from those for localization in azimuth, that positive correlation suggests that individual cortical neurons can integrate multiple cues for sound-source location.

AB Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is a prescribed treatment for various neuromuscular disorders, where an electrical stimulus is provided to elicit a muscle contraction. Barriers to the development of NMES controllers exist because the muscle response to an electrical stimulation is nonlinear and the muscle model is uncertain. Efforts in this paper focus on the development of an adaptive inverse optimal NMES controller. The controller yields desired limb trajectory tracking while simultaneously minimizing a cost functional that is positive in the error states and stimulation input. The development of this framework allows tradeoffs to be made between tracking performance and control effort by putting different penalties on error states and control input, depending on the clinical goal or functional task. The controller is examined through a Lyapunov-based analysis. Experiments on able-bodied individuals are provided to demonstrate the performance of the developed controller.

AB Background: Despite the advances in our understanding of aging-associated behavioral decline, relatively little is known about how aging affects neural circuits that regulate specific behaviors, particularly the expression of genes in specific neural circuits during aging. We have addressed this by exploring a peptidergic neuron R15, an identified neuron of the marine snail Aplysia californica. R15 is implicated in reproduction and osmoregulation and responds to neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, serotonin and glutamate and is characterized by its action potential bursts.
   Results: We examined changes in gene expression in R15 neurons during aging by microarray analyses of RNAs from two different age groups, mature and old animals. Specifically we find that 1083 ESTs are differentially regulated in mature and old R15 neurons. Bioinformatics analyses of these genes have identified specific biological pathways that are up or downregulated in mature and old neurons. Comparison with human signaling networks using pathway analyses have identified three major networks [(1) cell signaling, cell morphology, and skeletal muscular system development (2) cell death and survival, cellular function maintenance and embryonic development and (3) neurological diseases, developmental and hereditary disorders] altered in old R15 neurons. Furthermore, qPCR analysis of single R15 neurons to quantify expression levels of candidate regulators involved in transcription (CREB1) and translation (S6K) showed that aging is associated with a decrease in expression of these regulators, and similar analysis in three other neurons (L7, L11 and R2) showed that gene expression change during aging could be bidirectional.
   Conclusions: We find that aging is associated with bidirectional changes in gene expression. Detailed bioinformatics analyses and human homolog searches have identified specific biological processes and human-relevant signaling pathways in R15 that are affected during aging. Evaluation of gene expression changes in different neurons suggests specific transcriptomic signature of single neurons during aging.

AB PurposeBetween 30 and 68% of patients prematurely discontinue their antidepressant treatment, posing significant risks to patient safety and healthcare outcomes. Online healthcare forums have the potential to offer a rich and unique source of data, revealing dimensions of antidepressant discontinuation that may not be captured by conventional data sources.MethodsWe analyzed 891 patient narratives from the online healthcare forum, "askapatient.com," utilizing content analysis to create PsyRisk-a corpus highlighting the risk factors associated with antidepressant discontinuation. Leveraging PsyRisk, alongside PsyTAR [a publicly available corpus of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) related to antidepressants], we developed a machine learning-driven algorithm for proactive identification of patients at risk of abrupt antidepressant discontinuation.ResultsFrom the analyzed 891 patients, 232 reported antidepressant discontinuation. Among these patients, 92% experienced ADRs, and 72% found these reactions distressful, negatively affecting their daily activities. Approximately 26% of patients perceived the antidepressants as ineffective. Most reported ADRs were physiological (61%, 411/673), followed by cognitive (30%, 197/673), and psychological (28%, 188/673) ADRs. In our study, we employed a nested cross-validation strategy with an outer 5-fold cross-validation for model selection, and an inner 5-fold cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning. The performance of our risk identification algorithm, as assessed through this robust validation technique, yielded an AUC-ROC of 90.77 and an F1-score of 83.33. The most significant contributors to abrupt discontinuation were high perceived distress from ADRs and perceived ineffectiveness of the antidepressants.ConclusionThe risk factors identified and the risk identification algorithm developed in this study have substantial potential for clinical application. They could assist healthcare professionals in identifying and managing patients with depression who are at risk of prematurely discontinuing their antidepressant treatment.

AB A hybrid system that integrates two-dimensional (2D) GIS and three-dimensional (3D) visualization has been developed to provide unique solutions to application domains where traditional 2D GIS and 3D visualization cannot alone provide a solution. In this paper, we focus on three key issues in realizing such an integrated system, including large-scale terrain rendering, 2D and 3D combination display (for example, rendering 2D GIS layers in 3D space), expanding traditional 2D GIS analysis functions into a 31) environment, and visualizing 31) geographical data. A generic framework is developed to integrate 3D visualization with various types of 2D GIS, such as commercial GIS software, open source GIS software and spatial databases. A prototype 2D and 3D hybrid system that seamlessly integrates 2D GIS (developed with ArcEngine) and 3D rendering engine (developed with DirectX) is then developed based on the framework. In this hybrid system, 2D and 3D data are viewed within the same scene. Multiple 2D GIS layers are overlaid on the base terrain using a Level of Detail (LOD) model. Advanced query functions, data accessing, data management and spatial analysis, which are executed in the traditional 2D GIS, are provided to users in a 3D environment by continuously transforming information between the 2D GIS subsystem and the 3D subsystem. The 3:D data are organized and displayed by Keyhole Markup Language (KML) and textured 31) models in the COLLAborative Design Activity (COLLADA) format. The prototype demonstrates that this hybrid system has effectively addressed the three key issues identified above and that it can seamlessly integrate 2D GIS and 3D visualization. The hybrid system has great potential to be employed in many application domains, such as urban planning, landscape design and environmental decision making, among others, to enhance the 3D design capability and facilitate public participation in the planning, design and decision-making process.

AB Acoustic speech output results from coordinated articulation of dozens of muscles, bones and cartilages of the vocal mechanism. While we commonly take the fluency and speed of our speech productions for granted, the neural mechanisms facilitating the requisite muscular control are not completely understood. Previous neuroimaging and electrophysiology studies of speech sensorimotor control has typically concentrated on speech sounds (i.e., phonemes, syllables and words) in isolation; sentence-length investigations have largely been used to inform coincident linguistic processing. In this study, we examined the neural representations of segmental features (place and manner of articulation, and voicing status) in the context of fluent, continuous speech production. We used recordings from the cortical surface [electrocorticography (ECoG)] to simultaneously evaluate the spatial topography and temporal dynamics of the neural correlates of speech articulation that may mediate the generation of hypothesized gestural or articulatory scores. We found that the representation of place of articulation involved broad networks of brain regions during all phases of speech production: preparation, execution and monitoring. In contrast, manner of articulation and voicing status were dominated by auditory cortical responses after speech had been initiated. These results provide a new insight into the articulatory and auditory processes underlying speech production in terms of their motor requirements and acoustic correlates.

AB Addressing ecological impacts with effective conservation actions requires information on the links between human pressures and localized responses. Understanding links is a priority for many conservation contexts, including the world's fresh waters, which face intensifying threats to disproportionately high species diversity, including more than half of the world's fish species. Literature synthesis can uncover links and highlight potential research gaps, yet can be very cumbersome and time consuming. Emerging tools like text mining can improve efficiency in extracting relevant information from vast scientific outputs. This study synthesizes evidence of direct anthropogenic threats to major inland fisheries and examines driver-impact-response patterns using coupled automated and manual text classification methods. We screened 9336 abstracts from 45 river basins of high importance to inland fish production; 1152 abstracts contained evidence of direct threats to fish. The most common documented drivers were pollution, dams, and fishing pressure, which were most strongly linked to decreased fitness, altered reproduction, and mortality, respectively. Strong impact-response links to pollution signal potential bias toward documenting acute threats that generate more visible and immediate impacts. The use of machine learning-based text classification performed best in classifying extraneous information. Results can inform the development of inland fisheries indicators and threat-based metrics, highlight possible evidence gaps in linking global drivers to fishery-level responses, and illustrate the application of a coupled synthesis approach for improved efficiency and extraction of information relevant to conservation outcomes. The associated user and interpretation guides address accessibility and technical barriers faced by conservation scientists to improve efficiency in evidence synthesis.
   Coupled manual and automated literature synthesis methods can be used to improve efficiency in large reviews and optimize extraction of evidence to inform conservation planning and outcomes. Users (1) define a research question of interest, (2) screen documents using search criteria, (3) identify documents relevant to the study, (4) synthesize evidence from documents, and (5) evaluate links to conservation outcomes. image

AB Impaired decision-making in aging can directly impact factors (financial security, health care) that are critical to maintaining quality of life and independence at advanced ages. Naturalistic rodent models mimic human aging in other cognitive domains, and afford the opportunity to parse the effects of age on discrete aspects of decision-making in a manner relatively uncontaminated by experiential factors. Young adult (5-7 months) and aged (23-25 months) male F344 rats were trained on a probability discounting task in which they made discrete-trial choices between a small certain reward (one food pellet) and a large but uncertain reward (two food pellets with varying probabilities of delivery ranging from 100 to 0%). Young rats chose the large reward when it was associated with a high probability of delivery and shifted to the small but certain reward as probability of the large reward decreased. As a group, aged rats performed comparably to young, but there was significantly greater variance among aged rats. One subgroup of aged rats showed strong preference for the small certain reward. This preference was maintained under conditions in which large reward delivery was also certain, suggesting decreased sensitivity to reward magnitude. In contrast, another subgroup of aged rats showed strong preference for the large reward at low probabilities of delivery. Interestingly, this subgroup also showed elevated preference for probabilistic rewards when reward magnitudes were equalized. Previous findings using this same aged study population described strongly attenuated discounting of delayed rewards with age, together suggesting that a subgroup of aged rats may have deficits associated with accounting for reward costs (i.e., delay or probability). These deficits in cost-accounting were dissociable from the age-related differences in sensitivity to reward magnitude, suggesting that aging influences multiple, distinct mechanisms that can impact cost benefit decision-making.

AB A surrogate model is a common tool to approximate system response at untested points for design space exploration. Adaptive sampling has been studied for improving the accuracy of surrogates iteratively by introducing additional samples (simulations and experiments). New samples are often selected based on the estimated uncertainty in the design space. While some surrogates such as kriging have readily available uncertainty models for their predictions, other surrogates do not. Consequently, there have been studies of using the process of leaving-samples-out (LSO) used in cross-validation tools to estimate prediction uncertainty, such as the universal prediction distribution (UPD). In this paper, an adaptive sampling scheme for general surrogates is proposed based on LSO, similar to cross-validation and interquartile range (IQR). Multiple submodels are first developed from LSO. The uncertainty is then estimated from the IQR of these surrogates at a given point. New samples are added iteratively at the point with maximum IQR for design space exploration. The proposed scheme is illustrated using kriging, radial basis function, and neural network surrogates. The proposed scheme is evaluated using four algebraic test functions. Multiple sets of initial samples were produced to account for randomness. For these test functions, the proposed scheme was found to be more accurate and robust than kriging with its own uncertainty model. The proposed scheme was more accurate than the UPD for three out of the four test functions. For a fixed number of samples, the IQR-based adaptive sampling also proved to be more accurate than all-at-once sampling in most cases even when the estimated uncertainty was only mildly correlated with prediction errors.

AB Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) neuropathology is characterized by intraneuronal protein aggregates composed of misfolded alpha-Synuclein (alpha-Syn), as well as degeneration of substantia nigra dopamine neurons. Deficits in olfactory perception and aggregation of alpha-Syn in the olfactory bulb (OB) are observed during early stages of PD, and have been associated with the PD prodrome, before onset of the classic motor deficits. alpha-Syn fibrils injected into the OB of mice cause progressive propagation of alpha-Syn pathology throughout the olfactory system and are coupled to olfactory perceptual deficits.
   Objective: We hypothesized that accumulation of pathogenic alpha-Syn in the OB impairs neural activity in the olfactory system.
   Methods: To address this, we monitored spontaneous and odor-evoked local field potential dynamics in awake wild type mice simultaneously in the OB and piriform cortex (PCX) one, two, and three months following injection of pathogenic preformed la-Syn fibrils in the OB.
   Results: We detected alpha-Syn pathology in both the OB and PCX. We also observed that alpha-Syn fibril injections influenced odor-evoked activity in the OB. In particular, alpha-Syn fibril-injected mice displayed aberrantly high odor-evoked power in the beta spectral range. A similar change in activity was not detected in the PCX, despite high levels of alpha-Syn pathology.
   Conclusion: Together, this work provides evidence that synucleinopathy impacts in vivo neural activity in the olfactory system at the network-level.

AB Background: Synchronized oscillation in cortical networks has been suggested as a mechanism for diverse functions ranging from perceptual binding to memory formation to sensorimotor integration. Concomitant with synchronization is the occurrence of near-zero phase-lag often observed between network components. Recent theories have considered the importance of this phenomenon in establishing an effective communication framework among neuronal ensembles.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Two factors, among possibly others, can be hypothesized to contribute to the near-zero phase-lag relationship: (1) positively correlated common input with no significant relative time delay and (2) bidirectional interaction. Thus far, no empirical test of these hypotheses has been possible for lack of means to tease apart the specific causes underlying the observed synchrony. In this work simulation examples were first used to illustrate the ideas. A quantitative method that decomposes the statistical interdependence between two cortical areas into a feed-forward, a feed-back and a common-input component was then introduced and applied to test the hypotheses on multichannel local field potential recordings from two behaving monkeys.
   Conclusion/Significance: The near-zero phase-lag phenomenon is important in the study of large-scale oscillatory networks. A rigorous mathematical theorem is used for the first time to empirically examine the factors that contribute to this phenomenon. Given the critical role that oscillatory activity is likely to play in the regulation of biological processes at all levels, the significance of the proposed method may extend beyond systems neuroscience, the level at which the present analysis is conceived and performed.

AB The Implicit Association Test (IAT), like many behavioral measures, seeks to quantify meaningful individual differences in cognitive processes that are difficult to assess with approaches like self-reports. However, much like other behavioral measures, many IATs appear to show low test-retest reliability and typical scoring methods fail to quantify all of the decision-making processes that generate the overt task performance. Here, we develop a new modeling approach for IATs based on the geometric similarity representation (GSR) model. This model leverages both response times and accuracy on IATs to make inferences about representational similarity between the stimuli and categories. The model disentangles processes related to response caution, stimulus encoding, similarities between concepts and categories, and response processes unrelated to the choice itself. This approach to analyzing IAT data illustrates that the unreliability in IATs is almost entirely attributable to the methods used to analyze data from the task: GSR model parameters show test-retest reliability around .80-.90, on par with reliable self-report measures. Furthermore, we demonstrate how model parameters result in greater validity compared to the IAT D-score, Quad model, and simple diffusion model contrasts, predicting outcomes related to intergroup contact and motivation. Finally, we present a simple point-and-click software tool for fitting the model, which uses a pre-trained neural network to estimate best-fit parameters of the GSR model. This approach allows easy and instantaneous fitting of IAT data with minimal demands on coding or technical expertise on the part of the user, making the new model accessible and effective.

AB Neuropathological conditions often result in abnormal functional relationship between different regions in the brain and are specific to certain spectral bands that are not known in advance. Typically, these abnormalities are spatially and temporally very localized in nature, and detecting these changes can be clinically very useful. In this article, a novel evolutionary computation-based procedure is introduced to discover such localized changes in a data-driven manner. Given a predefined set of regions of interest (ROIs), the procedure automatically detects a subset of ROIs, a time window, and a frequency band, such that the functional relationship among the ROIs significantly differ between controls and neuropathological cases; the procedure makes no prior assumptions regarding the spectral characteristics of the data. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this procedure, a publicly available EEG dataset of 46 alcoholics and 31 controls is used. In all, 100 cross-validation runs are performed. Using the procedure, many weakened inter-hemispheric functional connections, primarily between the left and the right parietal lobe sensors, are detected in chronic alcoholics. For these functional connections, gamma band (35-50 Hz) activity in 200-400 ms window was found to be significantly different between alcoholics and controls. These results are consistent with the existing literature and helps to validate the procedure. In addition, the procedure is also tested via simulation using a graph generation model with known characteristics, and its general utility to brain imaging literature is discussed.

AB The current meta-analytic review examined the effectiveness of job search interventions in facilitating job search success (i.e., obtaining employment). Major theoretical perspectives on job search interventions, including behavioral learning theory, theory of planned behavior, social cognitive theory, and coping theory, were reviewed and integrated to derive a taxonomy of critical job search intervention components. Summarizing the data from 47 experimentally or quasi-experimentally evaluated job search interventions, we found that the odds of obtaining employment were 2.67 times higher for job seekers participating in job search interventions compared to job seekers in the control group, who did not participate in such intervention programs. Our moderator analysis also suggested that job search interventions that contained certain components, including teaching job search skills, improving self-presentation, boosting self-efficacy, encouraging proactivity, promoting goal setting, and enlisting social support, were more effective than interventions that did not include such components. More important, job search interventions effectively promoted employment only when both skill development and motivation enhancement were included. In addition, we found that job search interventions were more effective in helping younger and older (vs. middle-aged) job seekers, short-term (vs. long-term) unemployed job seekers, and job seekers with special needs and conditions (vs. job seekers in general) to find employment. Furthermore, meta-analytic path analysis revealed that increased job search skills, job search self-efficacy, and job search behaviors partially mediated the positive effect of job search interventions on obtaining employment. Theoretical and practical implications and future research directions are discussed.

AB Large-scale recurrent networks have drawn increasing attention recently because of their capabilities in modeling a large variety of real-world phenomena and physical mechanisms. This paper studies how to identify all authentic connections and estimate system parameters of a recurrent network, given a sequence of node observations. This task becomes extremely challenging in modern network applications, because the available observations are usually very noisy and limited, and the associated dynamical system is strongly nonlinear. By formulating the problem as multivariate sparse sigmoidal regression, we develop simple-to-implement network learning algorithms, with rigorous convergence guarantee in theory, for a variety of sparsity- promoting penalty forms. A quantile variant of progressive recurrent network screening is proposed for efficient computation and allows for direct cardinality control of network topology in estimation. Moreover, we investigate recurrent network stability conditions in Lyapunov's sense, and integrate such stability constraints into sparse network learning. Experiments show excellent performance of the proposed algorithms in network topology identification and forecasting.

AB Racial and ethnic minorities bear a disproportionate burden of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its complications, with social determinants of health (SDoH) recognized as key drivers of these disparities. Implementing efficient and effective social needs management strategies is crucial. We propose a machine learning analytic pipeline to calculate the individualized polysocial risk score (iPsRS), which can identify T2D patients at high social risk for hospitalization, incorporating explainable AI techniques and algorithmic fairness optimization. We use electronic health records (EHR) data from T2D patients in the University of Florida Health Integrated Data Repository, incorporating both contextual SDoH (e.g., neighborhood deprivation) and person-level SDoH (e.g., housing instability). After fairness optimization across racial and ethnic groups, the iPsRS achieved a C statistic of 0.71 in predicting 1-year hospitalization. Our iPsRS can fairly and accurately screen patients with T2D who are at increased social risk for hospitalization.

AB BACKGROUND: Pressure support ventilation (PSV) should be applied so that the inspiratory muscles are unloaded appropriately. We developed a computerized advisory system that assesses the load on the inspiratory muscles to spontaneously inhale, reflected by the automatically and noninvasively measured work of breathing per minute, and tolerance for that load, reflected by spontaneous breathing frequency and tidal volume, in a fuzzy-logic algorithm that provides recommendations for setting PSV. We call this a load and tolerance strategy for determining PSV. METHODS: In a clinical validation study, we compared the recommendations from our PSV advisory system to the recommendations of experienced critical-care Registered Respiratory Therapists (RRTs) for setting PSV in patients with respiratory failure. With 76 adult patients in a university medical center surgical intensive care unit receiving PSV, a combined pressure/flow sensor, positioned between the endotracheal tube and patient Y-piece, sent measurements to the PSV advisory system. We compared the advisory system's recommendations (increase, maintain, or decrease the pressure support) to the RRTs' recommendations at the bedside. RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the RRTs' and the advisory system's recommendations (n = 109) to increase, maintain, or decrease PSV. The RRTs agreed with 91% of the advisory system's recommendations (kappa statistic 0.85, P < .001). The advisory system was very good at predicting the RRTs' pressure support recommendations (r(2) = 0.87, P < .02). CONCLUSIONS: A load and tolerance strategy with a computerized PSV advisory system provided valid recommendations for setting PSV to unload the inspiratory muscles, and the recommendations were essentially the same as the recommendations from experienced critical-care RRTs. The PSV advisory system operates continuously and automatically and may be useful in clinical environments where experts are not always available.

TI Open Soil Spectral Library (OSSL): Building reproducible soil

AB Soil spectroscopy is a widely used method for estimating soil properties that are important to environmental and agricultural monitoring. However, a bottleneck to its more widespread adoption is the need for establishing large reference datasets for training machine learning (ML) models, which are called soil spectral libraries (SSLs). Similarly, the prediction capacity of new samples is also subject to the number and diversity of soil types and conditions represented in the SSLs. To help bridge this gap and enable hundreds of stakeholders to collect more affordable soil data by leveraging a centralized open resource, the Soil Spectroscopy for Global Good initiative has created the Open Soil Spectral Library (OSSL). In this paper, we describe the procedures for collecting and harmonizing several SSLs that are incorporated into the OSSL, followed by exploratory analysis and predictive modeling. The results of 10-fold cross-validation with refitting show that, in general, mid-infrared (MIR)-based models are significantly more accurate than visible and near-infrared (VisNIR) or near-infrared (NIR) models. From independent model evaluation, we found that Cubist comes out as the best-performing ML algorithm for the calibration and delivery of reliable outputs (prediction uncertainty and representation flag). Although many soil properties are well predicted, total sulfur, extractable sodium, and electrical conductivity performed poorly in all spectral regions, with some other extractable nutrients and physical soil properties also performing poorly in one or two spectral regions (VisNIR or NIR). Hence, the use of predictive models based solely on spectral variations has limitations. This study also presents and discusses several other open resources that were developed from the OSSL, aspects of opening data, current limitations, and future development. With this genuinely open science project, we hope that OSSL becomes a driver of the soil spectroscopy community to accelerate the pace of scientific discovery and innovation.

AB Background: Late onset bipolar disorder (LOBD) is often difficult to distinguish from degenerative dementias, such as Alzheimer disease (AD), due to comorbidities and common cognitive symptoms. Moreover, LOBD prevalence in the elder population is not negligible and it is increasing. Both pathologies share pathophysiological neuroinflammation features. Improvements in differential diagnosis of LOBD and AD will help to select the best personalized treatment.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the relative significance of clinical observations, neuropsychological tests, and specific blood plasma biomarkers (inflammatory and neurotrophic), separately and combined, in the differential diagnosis of LOBD versus AD. It was carried out evaluating the accuracy achieved by classification-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems based on these variables.
   Materials: A sample of healthy controls (HC) (n=26), AD patients (n=37), and LOBD patients (n=32) was recruited at the Alava University Hospital. Clinical observations, neuropsychological tests, and plasma biomarkers were measured at recruitment time.
   Methods: We applied multivariate machine learning classification methods to discriminate subjects from HC, AD, and LOBD populations in the study. We analyzed, for each classification contrast, feature sets combining clinical observations, neuropsychological measures, and biological markers, including inflammation biomarkers. Furthermore, we analyzed reduced feature sets containing variables with significative differences determined by a Welch's t-test. Furthermore, a battery of classifier architectures were applied, encompassing linear and non-linear Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), Classification and regression trees (CART), and their performance was evaluated in a leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation scheme. Post hoc analysis of Gini index in CART classifiers provided a measure of each variable importance.
   Results: Welch's t-test found one biomarker (Malondialdehyde) with significative differences (p < 0.001) in LOBD vs. AD contrast. Classification results with the best features are as follows: discrimination of HC vs. AD patients reaches accuracy 97.21% and AUG 98.17%. Discrimination of LOBD vs. AD patients reaches accuracy 90.26% and AUG 89.57%. Discrimination of HC vs LOBD patients achieves accuracy 95.76% and AUG 88.46%.
   Conclusion: It is feasible to build CAD systems for differential diagnosis of LOBD and AD on the basis of a reduced set of clinical variables. Clinical observations provide the greatest discrimination. Neuropsychological tests are improved by the addition of biomarkers, and both contribute significantly to improve the overall predictive performance.

AB Anomalies in default mode network (DMN) activity and alpha (8-12 Hz) oscillations have been independently observed in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Recent spatiotemporal analyses suggest that alpha oscillations support DMN functioning via interregional synchronization and sensory cortical inhibition. Therefore, we examined a unifying pathology of alpha deficits in the visual-cortex-DMN system in PTSD. Human patients with PTSD (N = 25) and two control groups, patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; N = 24) and healthy controls (HCs; N = 20), underwent a standard eyes-open resting state (S-RS) and a modified resting state (M-RS) of passively viewing salient images (known to deactivate the DMN). High-density electroencephalogram (hdEEG) were recorded, from which intracortical alpha activity (power and connectivity/Granger causality) was extracted using the exact low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA). Patients with PTSD (vs GAD/HC) demonstrated attenuated alpha power in the visual cortex (VC) and key hubs of the DMN [posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)] at both states, the severity of which further correlated with hypervigilance symptoms. With increased visual input (at M-RS vs S-RS), patients with PTSD further demonstrated reduced alpha-frequency directed connectivity within the DMN (PCC -> mPFC) and, importantly, from the VC to both DMN hubs (VC -> PCC and VC -> mPFC), linking alpha deficits in the two systems. These interrelated alpha deficits align with DMN hypoactivity/hypoconnectivity, sensory disinhibition, and hypervigilance in PTSD, representing a unifying neural underpinning of these anomalies. The identification of visual-cortex-DMN alpha dysrhythmia in PTSD further presents a novel therapeutic target, promoting network-based intervention of neural oscillations.

AB The default mode network (DMN), a group of brain regions implicated in passive thought processes, has been proposed as a potentially informative neural marker to aid in novel treatment development. However, the DMN's internal connectivity and its temporal relationship (ie, functional network connectivity) with pain-related neural networks in chronic pain conditions is poorly understood, as is the DMN's sensitivity to analgesic effects. The current study assessed how DMN functional connectivity and its temporal association with 3 pain-related networks changed after rectal lidocaine treatment in irritable bowel syndrome patients. Eleven females with irritable bowel syndrome underwent a rectal balloon distension paradigm during functional magnetic resonance imaging in 2 conditions: natural history (ie, baseline) and lidocaine. Results showed increased DMN connectivity with pain-related regions during natural history and increased within-network connectivity of DMN structures under lidocaine. Further, there was a significantly greater lag time between 2 of the pain networks, those involved in cognitive and in affective pain processes, comparing lidocaine to natural history. These findings suggest that 1) DMN plasticity is sensitive to analgesic effects, and 2) reduced pain ratings via analgesia reflect DMN connectivity more similar to pain-free individuals. Findings show potential implications of this network as an approach for understanding clinical pain management techniques.
   Perspective: This study shows that lidocaine, a peripheral analgesic, significantly altered DMN connectivity and affected its relationship with pain-related networks. These findings suggest that the DMN, which is hypothesized to represent non-goal-oriented activity, is sensitive to analgesic effects and could be useful to understand pain treatment mechanisms.

AB The central nervous melanocortin system is a neural network linking nutrient-sensing systems with hypothalamic, limbic and hindbrain neurons regulating behavior and metabolic homeostasis. Primary melanocortin neurons releasing melanocortin receptor ligands residing in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus are regulated by nutrient-sensing and metabolic signals. A smaller group of primary neurons releasing melanocortin agonists in the nucleus tractus solitarius in the brainstem are also regulated by signals of metabolic state. Two melanocortin receptors regulate energy homeostasis. Melanocortin-4 receptors regulate satiety and autonomic outputs controlling peripheral metabolism. The functions of melanocortin-3 receptors (MC3R) expressed in hypothalamic and limbic structures are less clear. Here we discuss published data and preliminary observations from our laboratory suggesting that neural MC3R regulate inputs into systems governing the synchronization of rhythms in behavior and metabolism with nutrient intake. Mice subjected to a restricted feeding protocol, where a limited number of calories are presented at a 24 h interval, rapidly exhibit bouts of increased wakefulness and activity which anticipate food presentation. The full expression of these responses is dependent on MC3R. Moreover, MC3R knockout mice are unique in exhibiting a dissociation of weight loss from improved glucose homeostasis when subject to a restricted feeding protocol. While mice lacking MC3R fed ad libitum exhibit normal to moderate hyperinsulinemia, when subjected to a restricted protocol they develop hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, and dyslipidemia. Collectively, our data suggest that the central nervous melanocortin system is a point convergence in the control of energy balance and the expression of rhythms anticipating nutrient intake.

AB A number of previous studies have indicated that lesions of the medial agranular cortex (AGm) in rats induce multimodal neglect and extinction to bilateral simultaneous stimulation (extinction), the two major symptoms of the neglect syndrome in humans. A recent study demonstrated that lesions of dorsocentral striatum (DCS), the site of AGm projections to the striatum, produce multimodal neglect qualitatively similar to that found with AGm lesions. In the present study, the behavioral effects of unilateral DCS lesions were examined in more detail for the major manifestations of neglect: hemineglect, extinction, and allesthesia/allokinesia. Subjects were tested for extinction to bilateral simultaneous stimulation of the forepaws three times a week for 3 weeks. Neglect testing occurred twice weekly and the subjects were tested for the presence of neglect by rating the magnitude of orientation to visual, tactile, and auditory stimulation. The results indicated that DCS operates, while demonstrating severe neglect, failed to demonstrate extinction or allesthesia/allokinesia. These findings suggest that the neural mechanisms that underlie neglect and extinction are dissociable in this system. A better understanding of the neural mechanisms that underlie extinction is particularly important because humans that have recovered from neglect often continue to demonstrate the debilitating symptoms of extinction.

AB Hemodynamic factors, induced by pulsatile blood flow, play a crucial role in vascular health and diseases, such as the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Computational fluid dynamics, finite element analysis, and fluid-structure interaction simulations have been widely used to quantify detailed hemodynamic forces based on vascular images commonly obtained from computed tomography angiography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, and optical coherence tomography. In this review, we focus on methods for obtaining accurate hemodynamic factors that regulate the structure and function of vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells. We describe the multiple steps and recent advances in a typical patient-specific simulation pipeline, including medical imaging, image processing, spatial discretization to generate computational mesh, setting up boundary conditions and solver parameters, visualization and extraction of hemodynamic factors, and statistical analysis. These steps have not been standardized and thus have unavoidable uncertainties that should be thoroughly evaluated. We also discuss the recent development of combining patient-specific models with machine-learning methods to obtain hemodynamic factors faster and cheaper than conventional methods. These critical advances widen the use of biomechanical simulation tools in the research and potential personalized care of vascular diseases.

AB Airborne particulate matter (PM) mass concentrations measured by conventional monitoring stations are reliable data sources for air quality communication, pollution mapping, and exposure estimation. A high spatiotemporal density of monitoring stations can provide a better understanding of PM transport on a regional and global scale and help to reduce exposure misclassification leading to a better assessment of the health impacts associated with PM exposure. However, due to the cost and operational complexities, only a limited number of such PM monitors can be deployed. Apart from conventional measurements, PM mass concentration can be estimated from aerosol optical depth (AOD) data observations by using empirical, semi-empirical or modeling methods, but these datasets are usually compromised by weather conditions and lack of knowledge of aerosol properties. In addition to the above methods, a network of low-cost PM sensors is also a promising approach to increase the measurement density. In this study, we propose an integration of information from multiple measurement approaches. We demonstrate this approach by synergizing the data from 75 monitoring stations, 2,363 AirBox low-cost sensors (the amount of data entries is similar to 10 million), and the Terra remote sensing satellite to estimate surface concentrations of PM for Taiwan Main Island during July 14 2018 to Oct 31 in 2018. A machine learning method selects the useful data from the low-cost sensor datasets, and the ordinary Kriging method is used to create a visual daily PM distribution map. The integration of datasets can enhance the overall data quantity and quality, leading to more accurate pollution maps with greater detail. The maps created from these three data sources demonstrate an approximate 30-fold synergistic improvement in the spatial resolution of PM mapping. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the predicted maps was analyzed through leave-one-out cross-validation, ten-fold cross-validation, and standard data validation. It shows that including low-cost PM sensor data brings in greater detail and largely enhances the spatial distribution while maintaining the pollution mapping characteristics. The approach described here will greatly assist the validation of PM transport models and enhance the accuracy of exposure estimations in future studies.

AB Introduction: Psychological factors have been associated with knee osteoarthritis pain severity and treatment outcomes, yet their combined contribution to phenotypic heterogeneity is poorly understood. In particular, empirically derived psychological profiles must be replicated before they can be targeted or considered for treatment studies. The objectives of this study were to (1) confirm previously identified psychological profiles using unsupervised clustering methods in persons with knee osteoarthritis pain, (2) determine the replicability of profiles using supervised machine learning in a different sample, and (3) examine associations with clinical pain, brain structure, and experimental pain.
   Methods: Participants included two cohorts of individuals with knee osteoarthritis pain recruited as part of the multisite UPLOAD? (n=270, mean age = 56.8 +/- 7.6, male = 37%) and UPLOAD2 (n=164, mean age = 57.73 +/- 7.8, male = 36%) studies. Similar psychological constructs (e.g. optimism, coping, somatization, affect, depression, and anxiety), sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, and somatosensory function were assessed across samples. UPLOAD2 participants also completed brain magnetic resonance imaging. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis was first conducted in UPLOAD1 data to derive clusters, followed by supervised linear discriminative analysis to predict group membership in UPLOAD2 data. Associations among cluster membership and clinical variables were assessed, controlling for age, sex, education, ethnicity/race, study site, and number of pain sites.
   Results: Four distinct profiles emerged in UPLOAD1 and were replicated in UPLOAD2. Identified psychological profiles were associated with psychological variables (ps <0.001), and clinical outcomes (ps = 0.001-0.03), indicating good internal and external validation of the cluster solution. Significant associations between psychological profiles and somatosensory function and brain structure were also found.
   Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of considering the biopsychosocial model in knee osteoarthritis pain assessment and treatment.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of dabigatran etexilate, approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2010 for the prevention of cardioembolic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation; potential off-label use is treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolic disorders.
   DATA SOURCES: Literature was accessed through MEDLINE (1977-April 2011) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1977-April 2011) using the terms dabigatran, dabigatran etexilate, BIBR 1048, direct thrombin inhibitor, anticoagulant, and thromboembolism. In addition, US government Web sites, including clinicaltrials.gov and fda.gov, were reviewed for pertinent information. Lastly, reference citations from publications identified in the initial search were reviewed.
   STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All English-language articles identified from the data sources were evaluated. For the evaluation of clinical efficacy and safety, only Phase 2 and 3 studies are included in this review.
   DATA SYNTHESIS: In 6 published Phase 3 trials to date, dabigatran has exhibited a similar efficacy and safety profile to that of comparator drugs, including dose-adjusted warfarin and enoxaparin, at various dosages. In the largest of these trials, RE-LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy), dabigatran was at least as effective as dose-adjusted warfarin in reducing stroke or systemic embolism. Overall bleeding risks were similar; however, dabigatran may be associated with a lower incidence of intracranial bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke but a higher incidence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Although dabigatran is not approved for venous thromboembolism (VTE) prevention or treatment, results of the RE-MODEL and RE-NOVATE trials suggest similar efficacy to once-daily dosing of enoxaparin 40 mg but inferior efficacy to the FDA-approved twice-daily dosing of enoxaparin 30 mg in the RE-MOBILIZE trial.
   CONCLUSIONS: Dabigatran is an effective and safe alternative to oral vitamin K antagonists for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, with fewer drug interactions and monitoring requirements. Additionally, dabigatran may be a viable alternative to enoxaparin in VIE prevention and warfarin in VTE treatment, although current trial data are limited.

AB Proximity to roads is one of the main determinants of deforestation in the Amazon basin. Determining the construction year of roads (CYR) is critical to improve the understanding of the drivers of road construction and to enable predictions of the expansion of the road network and its consequent impact on ecosystems. While recent artificial intelligence approaches have been successfully used for road extraction, they have typically relied on high spatial-resolution imagery, precluding their adoption for the determination of CYR for older roads. In this article, we developed a new approach to automate the process of determining CYR that relies on the approximate position of the current road network and a time-series of the proportion of exposed soil based on the multidecadal remote sensing imagery from the Landsat program. Starting with these inputs, our methodology relies on the Least Cost Path algorithm to co-register the road network and on a Before-After Control-Impact design to circumvent the inherent image-to-image variability in the estimated amount of exposed soil. We demonstrate this approach for a 357 000 km(2) area around the Transamazon highway (BR-230) in the Brazilian Amazon, encompassing 36 240 road segments. The reliability of this approach is assessed by comparing the estimated CYR using our approach to the observed CYR based on a time-series of Landsat images. This exercise reveals a close correspondence between the estimated and observed CYR (r(Pearson )= 0.77). Finally, we show how these data can be used to assess the effectiveness of protected areas (PAs) in reducing the yearly rate of road construction and thus their vulnerability to future degradation. In particular, we find that integral protection PAs in this region were generally more effective in reducing the expansion of the road network when compared to sustainable use PAs.

AB Augmented reality (AR) involves the overlay of computer-generated images onto the user's real-world visual field to modify or enhance the user's visual experience. With respect to neurosurgery, AR integrates preoperative and intraoperative imaging data to create an enriched surgical experience that has been shown to improve surgical planning, refine neuronavigation, and reduce operation time. In addition, AR has the potential to serve as a valuable training tool for neurosurgeons in a way that minimizes patient risk while facilitating comprehensive training opportunities. The increased use of AR in neurosurgery over the past decade has led to innovative research endeavors aiming to develop novel, more efficient AR systems while also improving and refining present ones. In this review, we provide a concise overview of AR, detail current and emerging uses of AR in neurosurgery and neurosurgical training, discuss the limitations of AR, and provide future research directions. Following the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), 386 articles were initially identified. Two independent reviewers (GH and AC) assessed article eligibility for inclusion, and 31 articles are included in this review. The literature search included original (retrospective and prospective) articles and case reports published in English between 2013 and 2023. AR assistance has shown promise within neuro-oncology, spinal neurosurgery, neurovascular surgery, skull-base surgery, and pediatric neurosurgery. Intraoperative use of AR was found to primarily assist with surgical planning and neuronavigation. Similarly, AR assistance for neurosurgical training focused primarily on surgical planning and neuronavigation. However, studies included in this review utilize small sample sizes and remain largely in the preliminary phase. Thus, future research must be conducted to further refine AR systems before widespread intraoperative and educational use.

AB Laurel wilt (Lw) disease is an exotic and lethal disease that can kill laurel family trees very fast. It is vectored by the redbay ambrosia beetle that prefers to live and lay eggs inside avocado trees (among other plants). Lw disease continues to expand in Florida posing a major threat to the avocado industry. Early and accurate disease detection is very critical in this case to remove infected trees and distinguish Lw disease from other diseases or disorders with similar symptoms. Herein, we present a nondestructive remote sensing method to detect Lwinfected avocado trees (in early and late stage) and discriminate them from healthy and other factors that cause similar symptoms, such as iron and nitrogen deficiencies, by using a portable spectral data collection system (visible - near infrared; 400-970 nm). Two data sets were collected in 10 nm and 40 nm spectral resolution, and 23 vegetation indices (VIs) were calculated to detect Lw-affected trees by using two classification methods: decision tree (DT) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks. Additionally, the optimal wavelengths and VIs to discriminate healthy, Lw-infected and avocado trees with iron and nitrogen deficiencies were identified. The results showed that it was possible to detect Lw-infected trees at early stage and distinguish them from other biotic and abiotic factors with high accuracy (around 100%) using the MLP method. Poorer results were achieved with DTs. The optimum 10 nm wide bands and VIs selected for the Lw-detection were found in the red, red-edge and NIR bands.

AB The regulation of nutrients intake in plant life is a critical factor in preserving the quality of crops, enhancing yield rates, and minimizing the fertilizer consumption. Consequently, this research presents the design of an intelligent robot for real-time monitoring of plant nutrients within greenhouse environments. The robot's ability to detect and address iron deficiency in spinach plants was evaluated. To achieve this, the robot, equipped with a camera, captured visible imaging from surface of spinach plants including both the control group and the group subjected to iron deficiency stress. Statistical analysis of the data was performed at the probability level of 5 %, and genetic algorithm (GA) was utilized to select the most suitable features (G, Area, Energy, Entropy, R and L), from 41 extracted image parameters, including color, morphological, and texture features. An artificial neural network (ANN) was then employed to detect iron deficiency in plants, resulting in an accuracy of 96 %. Subsequently, the Gaussian kernel function of support vector regression (SVR) algorithm was used to predict spinach iron content, yielding the highest determination coefficient (R2 = 0.94) and the lowest values of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE = 5.92), root mean square error (RMSE = 0.43) and standard regression error (SRE = 2.66). The designed robot detected iron-deficient plants with precision, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 86 %, 82 %, 84 % and 83 %, respectively. The robot then took the necessary control actions to supply the deficiency of this nutrient by foliar spraying of more than 89 % of the crop area.

AB Advances in remote sensing imagery and machine learning applications unlock the potential for developing algorithms for species classification at the level of individual tree crowns at unprecedented scales. However, most approaches to date focus on site-specific applications and a small number of taxonomic groups. Little is known about how well these approaches generalize across broader geographic areas and ecosystems. Leveraging field surveys and hyperspectral remote sensing data from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), we developed a continental-extent model for tree species classification that can be applied to the network, including a wide range of US terrestrial ecosystems. We compared the performance of a model trained with data from 27 NEON sites to models trained with data from each individual site, evaluating advantages and challenges posed by training species classifiers at the US scale. We evaluated the effect of geographic location, topography, and ecological conditions on the accuracy and precision of species predictions (72 out of 77 species).On average, the general model resulted in good overall classification accuracy (micro-F1 score), with better accuracy than site-specific classifiers (average individual tree level accuracy of 0.77 for the general model and 0.70 for site-specific models). Aggregating species to the genus-level increased accuracy to 0.83. Regions with more species exhibited lower classification accuracy. Predicted species were more likely to be confused with congeneric and co-occurring species and confusion was highest for trees with structural damage and in complex closed-canopy forests. The model produced accurate estimates of uncertainty, correctly identifying trees where confusion was likely. Using only data from NEON, this single integrated classifier can make predictions for 20% of all tree species found in forest ecosystems across the entire US, which make up to roughly 90% of the upper canopy of the studied ecosystems. This suggests the potential for integrating information from multiple datasets and locations to develop broad scale general models for species classification from hyperspectral imaging.

AB Characterization of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) from high-throughput sequencing data of metagenomics and cultured bacterial samples is a challenging task, with the need to account for both computational (e.g., string algorithms) and biological (e.g., gene transfers, rearrangements) aspects. Curated ARG databases exist together with assorted ARG classification approaches (e.g., database alignment, machine learning). Besides ARGs that naturally occur in bacterial strains or are acquired through mobile elements, there are chromosomal genes that can render a bacterium resistant to antibiotics through point mutations, i.e., ARG variants (ARGVs). While ARG repositories also collect ARGVs, there are only a few tools that are able to identify ARGVs from metagenomics and high throughput sequencing data, with a number of limitations (e.g., pre-assembly, a posteriori verification of mutations, or specification of species). In this work we present the k-mer, i.e., strings of fixed length k, ARGV analyzer - KARGVA - an open-source, multi-platform tool that provides: (i) an ad hoc, large ARGV database derived from multiple sources; (ii) input capability for various types of high-throughput sequencing data; (iii) a three-way, hash-based, k-mer search setup to process data efficiently, linking k-mers to ARGVs, k-mers to point mutations, and ARGVs to k-mers, respectively; (iv) a statistical filter on sequence classification to reduce type I and II errors. On semi-synthetic data, KARGVA provides very high accuracy even in presence of high sequencing errors or mutations (99.2 and 86.6% accuracy within 1 and 5% base change rates, respectively), and genome rearrangements (98.2% accuracy), with robust performance on ad hoc false positive sets. On data from the worldwide MetaSUB consortium, comprising 3,700+ metagenomics experiments, KARGVA identifies more ARGVs than Resistance Gene Identifier (4.8x) and PointFinder (6.8x), yet all predictions are below the expected false positive estimates. The prevalence of ARGVs is correlated to ARGs but ecological characteristics do not explain well ARGV variance. KARGVA is publicly available at under MIT license.

AB This study was meant to analyze the neural control of the branchial muscles of the clam Mercenaria mercenaria. Gills isolated from the animal contract in response to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT), dopamine (DA), and acetylcholine (ACh); but the ACh contraction occurred only if the gills had been pretreated with the cholinesterase inhibitor eserine. The 5HT antagonists cyproheptadine and mianserin blocked the contractile effects of all of the agonists. However, gills exposed to the 5HT antagonists and eserine relaxed in response to ACh. The DA antagonist SCH-83566 inhibited the effects of DA, but had no effect on contractions induced by 5HT and ACh. The ACh antagonist hexamethonium inhibited both the excitatory and inhibitory effects of ACh, but had no effect on contractions induced by 5HT and DA. 5HT and DA in gill tissue were visualized by using immunohistochemistry. Within each gill filament are dorsoventral neurons running adjacent to the epithelium and containing immunoreactive 5HT and DA. A complex network of 5HT-positive fibers is associated with the septa, blood vessels, and muscles, whereas DA-positive fibers are restricted to the septa. We propose that 5HT is the excitatory transmitter to the gill muscles, and that DA and ACh exert their excitatory effects by stimulating 5HT motor nerves. ACh may also be an inhibitory transmitter of the muscles.

AB Objective: The goal of this study is to explore transformer-based models (eg, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers [BERT]) for clinical concept extraction and develop an open-source package with pretrained clinical models to facilitate concept extraction and other downstream natural language processing (NLP) tasks in the medical domain.
   Methods: We systematically explored 4 widely used transformer-based architectures, including BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, and ELECTRA, for extracting various types of clinical concepts using 3 public datasets from the 2010 and 2012 i2b2 challenges and the 2018 n2c2 challenge. We examined general transformer models pretrained using general English corpora as well as clinical transformer models pretrained using a clinical corpus and compared them with a long short-term memory conditional random fields (LSTM-CRFs) mode as a baseline. Furthermore, we integrated the 4 clinical transformer-based models into an open-source package.
   Results and Conclusion: The RoBERTa-MIMIC model achieved state-of-the-art performance on 3 public clinical concept extraction datasets with F1-scores of 0.8994, 0.8053, and 0.8907, respectively. Compared to the baseline LSTM-CRFs model, RoBERTa-MIMIC remarkably improved the F1-score by approximately 4% and 6% on the 2010 and 2012 i2b2 datasets. This study demonstrated the efficiency of transformer-based models for clinical concept extraction. Our methods and systems can be applied to other clinical tasks. The clinical transformer package with 4 pretrained clinical models is publicly available at https://github.com/uf-hobi-informatics-lab/ClinicalTransformerNER. We believe this package will improve current practice on clinical concept extraction and other tasks in the medical domain.

AB Lay Summary Vedolizumab (VDZ) is effective in the treatment of IBD. Immunophenotyping and RNAseq of T cells were used to inform its mechanism of action. Changes in T regulatory cells in the periphery and mucosa have the greatest relationship to VDZ response.
   Background Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) involves chronic T cell-mediated inflammatory responses. Vedolizumab (VDZ), a monoclonal antibody against alpha 4 beta 7 integrin, inhibits lymphocyte extravasation into intestinal mucosae and is effective in ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). Aim We sought to identify immune cell phenotypic and gene expression signatures that related to response to VDZ. Methods Peripheral blood (PBMC) and lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs) were analyzed by flow cytometry and Cytofkit. Sorted CD4( + )memory (Tmem) or regulatory T (Treg) cells from PBMC and LPMC were analyzed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Clinical response (>= 2-point drop in partial Mayo scores [UC] or Harvey-Bradshaw index [CD]) was assessed 14 to 22 weeks after VDZ initiation. Machine-learning models were used to infer combinatorial traits that predicted response to VDZ. Results Seventy-one patients were enrolled: 37 received VDZ and 21 patients remained on VDZ >2 years. Fourteen of 37 patients (38%; 8 UC, 6 CD) responded to VDZ. Immune cell phenotypes and CD4( + )Tmem and Treg transcriptional behaviors were most divergent between the ileum and colon, irrespective of IBD subtype or inflammation status. Vedolizumab treatment had the greatest impact on Treg metabolic pathways, and response was associated with increased expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation. The strongest clinical predictor of VDZ efficacy was concurrent use of thiopurines. Mucosal tissues offered the greatest number of response-predictive biomarkers, whereas PBMC Treg-expressed genes were the best predictors in combinatorial models of response. Conclusions Mucosal and peripheral blood immune cell phenotypes and transcriptional profiles can inform VDZ efficacy and inform new opportunities for combination therapies.

AB Sea clutter is the backscattered returns from a patch of the sea surface illuminated by a radar pulse. Robust detection of targets within sea clutter may strengthen coastal security, improve navigation safety, and help environmental monitoring. However, no simple and reliable methods for detecting targets within sea clutter have been proposed. We introduce the structure function based multifractal theory to analyze 392 sea clutter datasets measured under various sea and weather conditions. It is found that sea clutter data exhibit multifractal behaviors in the time scale range of about 0.01 s to a few seconds, especially for data with targets. The fractal and multifractal features of sea clutter enable us to develop a simple and effective method to detect targets within sea clutter. It is shown that the method achieves very high detection accuracy. It is further shown that in the time scale range of 0.01 s to a few seconds, sea clutter data is weakly nonstationary. The nonstationarity may explain why modeling using distributions such as Weibull, log-normal, K, and compound-Gaussian only offers limited understanding of the physics of sea clutter and is not very effective in detecting targets within sea clutter.

AB Unsupervised damage detection in the presence of both regular environmental variations, such as a daily change in temperature and humidity, and irregular environmental variations, such as rain and snow, remains a critical challenge in guided wave structural health monitoring. This paper proposes an optimal autoencoder-based damage detection strategy to solve this problem. Although the autoencoder and other neural networks have been used to detect anomalies in structural health monitoring, the training data has been also required to be collected from a known intact structure, which increases the time and labor cost for inspection and limits the application of such methods. Instead, our autoencoder is trained with guided wave data that contain uncontrolled regular, irregular, and damage variations. We investigate hyperparameters that will negatively influence autoencoder-based damage detection, including the training time and damage duration. We also propose sparsity, dropout, and weight decay regularization strategies to enhance the robustness of the autoencoder to these hyperparameters. Results show that our optimal autoencoder method can achieve an area under the receiver operating curve score near 0.92 for detecting damage present in the last 16 days, which improves previous local principal components analysis reconstruction methods with a score of 0.88.

AB A rodent model of directed attention has been developed based upon behavioral analysis of contralateral neglect, pharmacological manipulations, and anatomical analysis of neural circuitry. In each of these three domains the rodent model exhibits striking similarities to humans. We hypothesize that there is a specific thalamo-cortical-basal ganglia network that subserves spatial attentional functions. Key components of this network are medial agranular and posterior parietal cortex, dorsocentral striatum, and the lateral posterior thalamic nucleus. Several issues need to be addressed before we can hope to realistically understand or model the functions of this networks Among these are the roles of medial versus lateral posterior parietal cortex; cholinergic mechanisms in attention; interhemispheric interactions; the role of synchronous firing at the cortical, striatal, and thalamic levels; interactions between cortical and thalamic projections to the striatum; interactions between cortical and nigral inputs to the thalamus; the role of collicular inputs to the lateral posterior thalamic nucleus; the role of cerebral cortex versus superior colliculus in driving the motor output expressed as orienting behavior during directed attention; the extent to which the circuitry we describe for directed attention also plays a role in other forms of attention.

AB The link between age-related cellular changes within brain regions and larger scale neuronal ensemble dynamics critical for cognition has not been fully elucidated. The present study measured neuron activity within medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), perirhinal cortex (PER), and hippocampal subregion CA1 of young and aged rats by labeling expression of the immediate-early gene Arc. The proportion of cells expressing Arc was quantified at baseline and after a behavior that requires these regions. In addition, PER and CA1 projection neurons to PFC were identified with retrograde labeling. Within CA1, no age-related differences in neuronal activity were observed in the entire neuron population or within CA1 pyramidal cells that project to PFC. Although behavior was comparable across age groups, behaviorally driven Arc expression was higher in the deep layers of both PER and PFC and lower in the superficial layers of these regions. Moreover, age-related changes in activity levels were most evident within PER cells that project to PFC. These data suggest that the PER-PFC circuit is particularly vulnerable in advanced age.

AB Multi-step forecasting of air pollutants extends the horizon for individuals and authorities to take informed actions for mitigating potential risks. Due to the instability of air pollutants, current research primarily focuses on relatively short-term forecasting, with achieving ultra multi-step forecasting presenting a significant challenge. In response to this issue, this study proposes a novel model: Frequency Enhanced Decomposed Temporal Convolution Networks (Fed-TCN) to achieve ultra multi-step forecasting. This study applies time-frequency transformation to explore the frequency characteristics of air pollutants and extract long-term patterns. These patterns are then fed into TCN to enhance the accuracy of ultra multi-step forecasting. Extensive experiments were conducted on eight air pollutants at four monitoring stations in Shanghai. The results indicate variations in forecastable ranges for different pollutants. NO and NOx can be forecasted up to one week, while NO2, CO, SO2, and O3 require forecasting within 1-3 days (approximately 24-72 steps ahead). Furthermore, PM2.5 and PM10 can only be forecasted for short-term periods, not exceeding 12 h. When compared to baseline models, Fed-TCN achieves a 4.3%-11% lower Mean Absolute Error. Moreover, Fed-TCN provides insights into the contribution of pollutant composition patterns to forecasting accuracy. In general, daily patterns, semi-commuting patterns, and residuals contribute 68.8%-81.7% to ultra multi-step forecasting. The proposed method is applicable for ultra multi-step forecasts of other regions and different types of air pollutants.

AB Cellular senescence is a plausible mediator of age-associated declines in physical performance. To test this premise, we examined cross-sectional associations between circulating components of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and measures of physical function and muscle strength in 1377 older adults. We showed significant associations between multiple SASP proteins and the short physical performance battery (SPPB), its subcomponents (gait speed, balance, chair rise time), and 400-m walk time. Activin A, ICAM1, MMP7, VEGFA, and eotaxin showed strong associations based on gradient boost machine learning (GBM), and, when combined with other proteins, effectively identified participants at the greatest risk for mobility disability (SPPB score <= 7). Senescence biomarkers were also associated with lower grip strength, and GBM identified PARC, ADAMTS13, and RANTES as top candidates in females, and MMP2, SOST, and MCP1 in males. These findings highlight an association between senescence biomarkers and physical performance in older adults.

AB Substantial evidence suggests that a key distinction in the classification of human emotion is that between an appetitive motivational system associated with positive or pleasant emotion and an aversive motivational system associated with negative or unpleasant emotion. To explore the neural substrates of these two systems, 12 healthy women viewed sets of pictures previously demonstrated to elicit pleasant, unpleasant and neutral emotion, while positron emission tomographic (PET) measurements of regional cerebral blood flow were obtained. Pleasant and unpleasant emotions were each distinguished from neutral emotion conditions by significantly increased cerebral blood flow in the vicinity of the medial prefrontal cortex (Brodmann's area 9), thalamus, hypothalamus and midbrain (P < 0.005). Unpleasant was distinguished from neutral or pleasant emotion by activation of the bilateral occipito temporal cortex and cerebellum, and left parahippocampal gyrus, hippocampus and amygdala (P < 0.005). Pleasant was also distinguished from neutral but not unpleasant emotion by activation of the head of the left caudate nucleus (P < 0.005). These findings are consistent with those from other recent PET studies of human emotion and demonstrate that there are both common and unique components of the neural networks mediating pleasant and unpleasant emotion in healthy women.

AB Background: The majority of previous heroin cue-reactivity functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies focused on local function impairments, such as inhibitory control, decision-making and stress regulation. Our previous studies have demonstrated that these brain circuits also presented dysfunctional connectivity during the resting state. Yet few studies considered the relevance of resting state dysfunctional connectivity to task-related neural activity in the same chronic heroin user (CHU).
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We employed the method of graph theory analysis, which detected the abnormality of brain regions and dysregulation of brain connections at rest between 16 male abstinent chronic heroin users (CHUs) and 16 non-drug users (NDUs). Using a cue-reactivity task, we assessed the relationship between drug-related cue-induced craving activity and the abnormal topological properties of the CHUs' resting networks. Comparing NDUs' brain activity to that of CHUs, the intensity of functional connectivity of the medial frontal gyrus (meFG) in patients' resting state networks was prominently greater and positively correlated with the same region's neural activity in the heroin-related task; decreased functional connectivity intensity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in CHUs at rest was associated with more drug-related cue-induced craving activities.
   Conclusions: These results may indicate that there exist two brain systems interacting simultaneously in the heroin-addicted brain with regards to a cue-reactivity task. The current study may shed further light on the neural architecture that supports craving responses in heroin dependence.

AB The hippocampal local field potential (LFP) exhibits a strong correlation with behavior. During rest, the theta rhythm is not prominent, but during active behavior, there are strong rhythms in the theta, theta harmonics, and gamma ranges. With increasing running velocity, theta, theta harmonics and gamma increase in power and in cross-frequency coupling, suggesting that neural entrainment is a direct consequence of the total excitatory input. While it is common to study the parametric range between the LFP and its complementing power spectra between deep rest and epochs of high running velocity, it is also possible to explore how the spectra degrades as the energy is completely quenched from the system. Specifically, it is unknown whether the 1/f slope is preserved as synaptic activity becomes diminished, as low frequencies are generated by large pools of neurons while higher frequencies comprise the activity of more local neuronal populations. To test this hypothesis, we examined rat LFPs recorded from the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex during barbiturate overdose euthanasia. Within the hippocampus, the initial stage entailed a quasi-stationary LFP state with a power-law feature in the power spectral density. In the second stage, there was a successive erosion of power from high- to low-frequencies in the second stage that continued until the only dominant remaining power was <20 Hz. This stage was followed by a rapid collapse of power spectrum toward the absolute electrothermal noise background. As the collapse of activity occurred later in hippocampus compared with medial entorhinal cortex, it suggests that the ability of a neural network to maintain the 1/f slope with decreasing energy is a function of general connectivity. Broadly, these data support the energy cascade theory where there is a cascade of energy from large cortical populations into smaller loops, such as those that supports the higher frequency gamma rhythm. As energy is pulled from the system, neural entrainment at gamma frequency (and higher) decline first. The larger loops, comprising a larger population, are fault-tolerant to a point capable of maintaining their activity before a final collapse.

AB sAddictive drugs modulate synaptic transmission in the meso-corticolimbic system by hijacking normal adaptive forms of experience-dependent synaptic plasticity. Psychostimulants such as METH have been shown to affect hippocampal synaptic plasticity, albeit with a less understood synaptic mechanism. METH is one of the most addictive drugs that elicit long-term alterations in the synaptic plasticity in brain areas involved in reinforcement learning and reward processing. Dopamine transporter (DAT) is one of the main targets of METH. As a substrate for DAT, METH decreases dopamine uptake and increases dopamine efflux via the transporter in the target brain regions such as nucleus accumbens (NAc) and hippocampus. Due to cross talk between NAc and hippocampus, stimulation of NAc has been shown to alter hippocampal plasticity. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that manipulation of glutamatergic and GABA-ergic systems in the shell-NAc modulates METH-induced enhancement of long term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus. Rats treated with METH (four injections of 5 mg/kg) exhibited enhanced LTP as compared to saline-treated animals. Intra-NAc infusion of muscimol (GABA receptor agonist) decreased METH-induced enhancement of dentate gyrus (DG)-LTP, while infusion of AP5 (NMDA receptor antagonist) prevented METH-induced enhancement of LTP. These data support the interpretation that reducing NAc activity can ameliorate METH-induced hippocampal LTP through a hippocampus-NAc-VTA circuit loop. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB In many studies, it is common to use binary (i.e., unweighted) edges to examine networks of entities that are either adjacent or not adjacent. Researchers have generalized such binary networks to incorporate edge weights, which allow one to encode node-node interactions with heterogeneous intensities or frequencies (e.g., in transportation networks, supply chains, and social networks). Most such studies have considered real -valued weights, despite the fact that networks with complex weights arise in fields as diverse as quantum information, quantum chemistry, electrodynamics, rheology, and machine learning. Many of the standard network -science approaches in the study of classical systems rely on the real -valued nature of edge weights, so it is necessary to generalize them if one seeks to use them to analyze networks with complex edge weights. In this paper, we examine how standard network -analysis methods fail to capture structural features of networks with complex edge weights. We then generalize several network measures to the complex domain and show that random -walk centralities provide a useful approach to examine node importances in networks with complex weights.

ID RISK-FACTORS
AB Low Birth weight (LBW) infants pose a serious public health concern worldwide in both the short and long term for infants and their mothers. Infant weight prediction prior to birth can help to identify risk factors and reduce the risk of infant morbidity and mortality. Although many Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have been proposed for LBW prediction using maternal features and produced considerable model performance, their performance needs to be improved so that they can be adapted in real-world clinical settings. Existing algorithms used for LBW classification often fail to capture structural information from the tabular dataset of patients with different complications. Therefore, to improve the LBW classification performance, we propose a solution by transforming the tabular data into a knowledge graph with the aim that patients from the same class (normal or LBW) exhibit similar patterns in the graphs. To achieve this, several features related to each node are extracted such as node embedding using node2vec algorithm, node degree, node similarity, nearest neighbors, etc. Our method is evaluated on a real-life dataset obtained from a large cohort study in the United Arab Emirates which contains data from 3453 patients. Multiple experiments were performed using the seven most commonly used ML models on the original dataset, graph features, and a combination of features, respectively. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieved the best performance with an area under the curve of 0.834 which is over 6% improvement compared to using the original risk factors without transforming them into knowledge graphs. Furthermore, we provide the clinical relevance of the proposed model that are important for the model to be adapted in clinical settings.

AB With the proliferation of heterogeneous health care data in the last three decades, biomedical ontologies and controlled biomedical terminologies play a more and more important role in knowledge representation and management, data integration, natural language processing, as well as decision support for health information systems and biomedical research. Biomedical ontologies and controlled terminologies are intended to assure interoperability. Nevertheless, the quality of biomedical ontologies has hindered their applicability and subsequent adoption in real-world applications. Ontology evaluation is an integral part of ontology development and maintenance. In the biomedicine domain, ontology evaluation is often conducted by third parties as a quality assurance (or auditing) effort that focuses on identifying modeling errors and inconsistencies. In this work, we first organized four categorical schemes of ontology evaluation methods in the existing literature to create an integrated taxonomy. Further, to understand the ontology evaluation practice in the biomedicine domain, we reviewed a sample of 200 ontologies from the National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO) BioPortal the largest repository for biomedical ontologies and observed that only 15 of these ontologies have documented evaluation in their corresponding inception papers. We then surveyed the recent quality assurance approaches for biomedical ontologies and their use. We also mapped these quality assurance approaches to the ontology evaluation criteria. It is our anticipation that ontology evaluation and quality assurance approaches will be more widely adopted in the development life cycle of biomedical ontologies.

AB Young adult never cigarette smokers with disabilities may be at particular risk for adopting e-cigarettes, but little attention has been paid to these people. This study examines the associations between different types of disability and e-cigarette use in this population. Young adult never-smokers from the 2016-2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey who were either never or current e-cigarette users (n = 79,177) were selected for the analysis. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) algorithm was used to select confounders for multivariable logistic regression models. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the associations between current e-cigarette use and different types of disability after incorporating BRFSS survey design and adjusting for confounders. Young adult never-smokers who reported any disability had increased odds (OR 1.44, 95% CI 1.18-1.76) of e-cigarette use compared to those who reported no disability. Young adult never-smokers who reported self-care, cognitive, vision, and independent living disabilities had higher odds of e-cigarette use compared to those who reported no disability. There was no statistically significant difference in the odds of e-cigarette use for those reporting hearing and mobility disabilities compared to those who reported no disability. This study highlights the need for increased public education and cessation programs for this population.

AB Social status and dominance are critical factors influencing well-being and survival across multiple species. However, dominance behaviors vary widely across species, from elaborate feather displays in birds to aggression in chimps. To effectively study dominance, it is essential to clearly define and reliably measure dominance behaviors. In laboratory settings, C57BL/6 mice are commonly used to study dominance due to their stable and linear social hierarchies. However, other mouse strains are also used for laboratory research. Despite substantial evidence for strain effects on behavioral repertoires, the impact of strain on dominance in mice remains largely unstudied. To address this gap, we compared dominance behaviors between CD1 and C57BL/6 male mice across four assays: observation of agonistic behaviors, urine marking, tube test, and a reward competition. We found that CD1 mice demonstrate increased fighting, increased territorial marking through urination, and increased pushing and resisting in the tube test. We used unsupervised machine learning and pose estimation data from the reward competitions to uncover behavioral differences across strains and across rank differences between competing pairs. Of the four assays, urine marking and agonistic behaviors showed the strongest correlation with dominance in both strains. Most notably, we found that CD1 dominance rankings based on the tube test negatively correlated with rankings from all three other assays, suggesting that the tube test may measure a different behavior in CD1 mice. Our results highlight that behaviors can be strain-specific in mice and studies that measure social rank should consider assays carefully to promote reproducibility.

AB Background: Major postoperative complications are associated with increased cost and mortality. The complexity of electronic health records overwhelms physicians' abilities to use the information for optimal and timely preoperative risk assessment. We hypothesized that data-driven, predictive-risk algorithms implemented in an intelligent decision-support platform simplify and augment physicians' risk assessments.
   Methods: This prospective, nonrandomized pilot study of 20 physicians at a quaternary academic medical center compared the usability and accuracy of preoperative risk assessment between physicians and MySurgeryRisk, a validated, machine-learning algorithm, using a simulated workflow for the real-time, intelligent decision-support platform. We used area under the receiver operating characteristic curve to compare the accuracy of physicians' risk assessment for six postoperative complications before and after interaction with the algorithm for 150 clinical cases.
   Results: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the MySurgeryRisk algorithm ranged between 0.73 and 0.85 and was significantly better than physicians' initial risk assessments (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve between 0.47 and 0.69) for all postoperative complications except cardiovascular. After interaction with the algorithm, the physicians significantly improved their risk assessment for acute kidney injury and for an intensive care unit admission greater than 48 hours, resulting in a net improvement of reclassification of 12% and 16%, respectively. Physicians rated the algorithm as easy to use and useful.
   Conclusion: Implementation of a validated, MySurgeryRisk computational algorithm for real-time predictive analytics with data derived from the electronic health records to augment physicians' decision making is feasible and accepted by physicians. Early involvement of physicians as key stakeholders in both design and implementation of this technology will be crucial for its future success. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Event-related potentials (ERPs) are used extensively to investigate the neural mechanisms of attention control and selection. The univariate ERP approach, however, has left important questions inadequately answered. We addressed two questions by applying multivariate pattern classification to multichannel ERPs in two cued visual spatial attention experiments (N= 56): (a) impact of cueing strategies (instructional vs. probabilistic) on attention control and selection and (b) neural and behavioral effects of individual differences. Following cue onset, the decoding accuracy (cue left vs. cue right) began to rise above chance level earlier and remained higher in instructional cueing (similar to 80 ms) than in probabilistic cueing (similar to 160 ms), suggesting that unilateral attention focus leads to earlier and more distinct formation of the attention control set. A similar temporal sequence was also found for target-related processing (cued target vs. uncued target), suggesting earlier and stronger attention selection under instructional cueing. Across the two experiments: (a) individuals with higher cue-related decoding accuracy showed higher magnitude of attentional modulation of target-evoked N1 amplitude, suggesting that better formation of anticipatory attentional state leads to stronger modulation of target processing, and (b) individuals with higher target-related decoding accuracy showed faster reaction times (or larger cueing effects), suggesting that stronger selection of task-relevant information leads to better behavioral performance. Taken together, multichannel ERPs combined with machine learning decoding yields new insights into attention control and selection that complement the univariate ERP approach, and along with the univariate ERP approach, provides a more comprehensive methodology to the study of visual spatial attention.

AB Some hosts harbor more parasites than others. Overdispersion of parasitism suggests that coevolution with parasites may be more important to the biology and ecology of certain species. We examined patterns of parasitism and host traits in fished decapod crustaceans, which are economically and ecologically important worldwide. Using a synthesis approach, we determine that host life history, including habitat, longevity, sociality, invasion history, and fisheries involvement, correlate with the number and type of parasite species harbored. Indicator species analysis revealed close relationships between decapods and certain parasite groups, including crabs with rhizocephalans and dinoflagellates; crayfish with mesomycetozoans, oomycetes, branchiobdellids, and fungi; lobsters with copepods and amoebae; and shrimp with viruses. In contrast, Nematomorpha and Nemertea appear to be under-represented and under-studied as parasite groups in decapods. Decapods that are commercially fished, aquacultured, introduced outside their native range, and/or exhibit parental care tend to have higher parasite species richness (PSR). Parasite richness also increases with how well-studied a host group is, which we addressed with a machine learning algorithm that predicts false negative associations. Geographic range is commonly positively correlated with parasite richness, however reliable ranges are not available for most decapod species, highlighting a significant future research need. Identifying patterns such as these increases our broad understanding of decapod disease ecology but also enabled us to develop a series of recommendations on how to focus future research, management, and aquaculture development efforts.

ID LEVEL; MODEL
AB Eco-driving is considered a cost-effective way to reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions. However, ecodriving strategies for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) are understudied. Therefore, this study analyzed extensive road test data to assess HEV carbon reduction under different driving behaviors and to identify optimal ecodriving conditions. Firstly, the portable emissions measurement system (PEMS) was used to characterize the real-world emissions from two vehicles, one conventional vehicle (CV) and the other HEV. The results indicate that HEVs reduce average CO2 emissions by 24.5%-54.7% compared to CVs. Secondly, based on the measured data, the impact of driving behavior on emission was investigated. It demonstrated that driving behavior was closely linked to engine operating state in HEVs, which in turn significantly affects carbon emissions. Notably, the emission reduction advantage of HEVs diminishes when considering only the engine-on state. At cruising speeds below 10 m/s, HEVs emit approximately 68% more CO2 than CVs due to frequent start-stop cycles occurring. Finally, an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model was proposed to predict engine operating status based on driving behavior and external traffic conditions. Combined with the Local Interpretable ModelAgnostic Explanation (LIME) algorithm, this model provides insights into the factors influencing engine state predictions, thus offering real-time eco-driving strategies for HEVs' drivers. These findings reveal the carbon emission characteristics of HEVs under microscopic driving behavior and enhance the carbon reduction potential of HEVs in combination with eco-driving.

AB In this study we examined the neural control mechanisms that are at play when habitual code-switchers read code-switches embedded in a sentence context. The goal was also to understand if and to what extent the putative control network that is engaged during the comprehension of codeswitched sentences is modulated by the linguistic regularity of those switches. Towards that goal, we tested two different types of code switches (switches at the noun-phrase boundary and switches at the verb-phrase boundary) that despite being both represented in naturalistic corpora of code switching, show different distributional properties. Results show that areas involved in general cognitive control (e.g., pre-SMA, anterior cingulate cortex) are recruited when processing code-switched sentences, relative to non-code-switched sentences. Additionally, significant activation in the cerebellum when processing sentences containing code-switches at the noun-phrase boundary suggests that habitual code-switchers might engage a wider control network to adapt inhibitory control processes according to task demands. Results are discussed in the context of the current literature on neural models of bilingual language control.

AB BOLD-based fMRI is the most widely used method for studying brain function. The BOLD signal while valuable, is beset with unique vulnerabilities. The most notable of these is the modest signal to noise ratio, and the relatively low temporal and spatial resolution. However, the high dimensional complexity of the BOLD signal also presents unique opportunities for functional discovery. Topological Data Analyses (TDA), a branch of mathematics optimized to search for specific classes of structure within high dimensional data may provide particularly valuable applications. In this investigation, we acquired fMRI data in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) using a basic motor control paradigm. Then, for each participant and each of three task conditions, fMRI signals in the ACC were summarized using two methods: a) TDA based methods of persistent homology and persistence landscapes and b) non-TDA based methods using a standard vectorization scheme. Finally, using machine learning (with support vector classifiers), classification accuracy of TDA and non-TDA vectorized data was tested across participants. In each participant, TDA-based classification out-performed the non-TDA based counterpart, suggesting that our TDA analytic pipeline better characterized task- and condition-induced structure in fMRI data in the ACC. Our results emphasize the value of TDA in characterizing task- and condition-induced structure in regional fMRI signals. In addition to providing our analytical tools for other users to emulate, we also discuss the unique role that TDA-based methods can play in the study of individual differences in the structure of functional brain signals in the healthy and the clinical brain.

AB This article describes the development and implementation of adaptive transit signal priority (TSP) on an actuated dual-ring traffic signal control system. After providing an overview of architecture design of the adaptive TSP system, the article presents an adaptive TSP optimization model that optimizes green splits for three consecutive cycles to minimize the weighted sum of transit vehicle delay and other traffic delay, considering the safety and other operational constraints under the dual-ring structure of signal control. The model is illustrated using a numerical example under medium and heavily congested situations. The findings from a field operational test are also reported to validate and demonstrate the developed TSP system. At a congested intersection, it is found that the average bus delay and average traffic delay along the bus movement direction were reduced by approximately 43% and 16%, respectively. Moreover, the average delay of cross-street traffic was increased by about 12%.

AB Animal models of threat processing have evolved beyond the amygdala to incorpo-rate a distributed neural network. In human research, evidence has intensified in recent years to challenge the canonical threat circuitry centered on the amygdala, urging revision of threat conceptualization. A strong surge of research into threat processing in the sensory cortex in the past decade has generated particularly use-ful insights to inform the reconceptualization. Here, synthesizing findings from both animal and human research, we highlight sensitive, specific, and adaptable threat representations in the sensory cortex, arising from experience-based sculpting of sensory coding networks. We thus propose that the human sensory cortex can drive smart (fast and precise) threat evaluation, producing threat-imbued sensory afferents to elicit network-wide threat responses.

AB Obesity has become a serious epidemic and one of the leading global health problems. However, much of the current debate has been fractious, and etiologies of obesity have been attributed to eating behavior (i.e. fast food consumption), personality, depression, addiction or genetics. One of the interesting new hypotheses for explaining the development of obesity involves a food addiction model, which suggests that food is not eaten as much for survival as pleasure and that hedonic overeating is relevant to both substance-related disorders and eating disorders. Accumulating evidence has shown that there are a number of shared neural and hormonal pathways as well as distinct differences in these pathways that may help researchers discover why certain individuals continue to overeat despite health and other consequences, and becomes more and more obese. Functional neuroimaging studies have further revealed that pleasant smelling, looking, and tasting food has reinforcing characteristics similar to drugs of abuse. Many of the brain changes reported for hedonic eating and obesity are also seen in various types of addictions. Most importantly, overeating and obesity may have an acquired drive similar to drug addiction with respect to motivation and incentive craving. In both cases, the desire and continued satisfaction occur after early and repeated exposure to stimuli. The acquired drive for eating food and relative weakness of the satiety signal would cause an imbalance between the drive and hunger/reward centers in the brain and their regulation. In the current paper, we first provide a summary of literature on food addition from eight different perspectives, and then we proposed a research paradigm that may allow screening of new pharmacological treatment on the basis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

AB Dystonia is a network disorder involving multiple brain regions, such as the motor cortex, sensory cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum. Botulinum toxin (BoNT) is the first-line therapy for treating focal dystonia and is a potent molecule that blocks the release of acetylcholine at the peripheral neuromuscular junction. However, the clinical benefits of BoNT are not solely related to peripheral muscle relaxation or modulation of afferent input from the muscle spindle. An increasing body of evidence, albeit in smaller cohorts, has shown that BoNT leads to distant modulation of the pathological brain substrates implicated in dystonia. A single treatment session of BoNT has been observed to reduce excessive motor excitability and improve sensory processing. Furthermore, owing to plasticity effects that are induced by botulinum, neural reorganization of pathological networks occurs, presumably leading to defective motor programs of dystonia replaced with normal movement patterns. However, longitudinal studies investigating the effects of multiple treatment sessions in large, well-characterized homogenous cohorts of dystonia will provide further compelling evidence supporting central botulinum mechanisms.

AB The author discusses a neurological model of a modular network that mediates emotional experience. According to this theory, emotional experience has three components: valence (positive and negative), arousal, and motor activation (approach, avoid, neither). In this model, the cortex is critical in regulating activities of the limbic system, basal ganglia, and reticular system. The frontal lobes are important for valence: the left mediates positive emotions, the right negative emotions. The right hemisphere, especially the parietal lobe, is important in activating-arousal systems, and the left hemisphere modulates inhibition of these systems. The right hemisphere is also critical in motor activation. The frontal lobes, especially the orbitofrontal portions, mediate avoidance behaviors, and the parietal lobes mediate approach behaviors. The cortical areas discussed have rich interconnections and are also closely connected with the limbic system, basal ganglia, and reticular systems. Emotional experience may depend on the patterns of neural activation in this modular network.

AB A recently introduced molecular size-based model that allows a unified description of enthalpies of vaporization, boiling points, gas-liquid solubilities, and vapor pressures for simple organic liquids using a free energy expression obtained from molecular-level assumptions is summarized. By changing the interaction-related constant omega used by the model when water is the solvent, the model can be extended to describe alkane-water partition, octanol-water partition, and water solubility of solutes that have no hydrogen-bonding or strongly polar substituents. Here, it is shown that this Delta omega change, which is most likely related to the changes that the solute produces in the hydrogen-bonded structure of water, agrees very well with the value that can be derived from the modified hydration-shell hydrogen-bond model of Muller. By combining the present molecular size-based model with this hydrogen-bonding model, a simplified but consistent description is obtained for the properties of water and for the hydrophobic effect. This indicates that many unusual properties of water may be accounted for by a proper combination of the nonspecific interactions as extrapolated from other liquids, the unusually small size of its molecules, and an adequate model of hydrogen-bonding. A fully computerized method (QLogP) that can estimate octanol-water log P for a large variety of organic solutes also fits within this unified approach. Despite using only two parameters (molecular volume and a novel, quantified parameter that is probably hydrogen-bonding-related), the predictive power of this method is similar to that of the considerably more complex fragment-contribution methods often used by medicinal chemists (ACD/LogP, AFC, CLOGP, KLogP, MLogP, Rekker), as illustrated by a comparison based on various structures.

AB Emerging technologies are increasingly employed in environmental citizen science projects. This integration offers benefits and opportunities for scientists and participants alike. Citizen science can support large-scale, long-term monitoring of species occurrences, behaviour and interactions. At the same time, technologies can foster participant engagement, regardless of pre-existing taxonomic expertise or experience, and permit new types of data to be collected. Yet, technologies may also create challenges by potentially increasing financial costs, necessitating technological expertise or demanding training of participants. Technology could also reduce people's direct involvement and engagement with nature. In this perspective, we discuss how current technologies have spurred an increase in citizen science projects and how the implementation of emerging technologies in citizen science may enhance scientific impact and public engagement. We show how technology can act as (i) a facilitator of current citizen science and monitoring efforts, (ii) an enabler of new research opportunities, and (iii) a transformer of science, policy and public participation, but could also become (iv) an inhibitor of participation, equity and scientific rigour. Technology is developing fast and promises to provide many exciting opportunities for citizen science and insect monitoring, but while we seize these opportunities, we must remain vigilant against potential risks.This article is part of the theme issue 'Towards a toolkit for global insect biodiversity monitoring'.

AB In this paper, we provide an overview of how spatial video data collection enriched with contextual mapping can be used as a universal tool to investigate sub-neighborhood scale health risks, including cholera, in challenging environments. To illustrate the method's flexibility, we consider the life cycle of the Mujoga relief camp set up after the Nyiragongo volcanic eruption in the Democratic Republic of Congo on 22 May 2021. More specifically we investigate how these methods have captured the deteriorating conditions in a camp which is also experiencing lab-confirmed cholera cases. Spatial video data are collected every month from June 2021 to March 2022. These coordinate-tagged images are used to make monthly camp maps, which are then returned to the field teams for added contextual insights. At the same time, a zoom-based geonarrative is used to discuss the camp's changes, including the cessation of free water supplies and the visible deterioration of toilet facilities. The paper concludes by highlighting the next data science advances to be made with SV mapping, including machine learning to automatically identify and map risks, and how these are already being applied in Mujoga.

TI All models are wrong, but which are useful? Comparing parametric and
   nonparametric estimation of causal effects in finite samples
SO JOURNAL OF CAUSAL INFERENCE

DE parametric; nonparametric; causal inference
ID PROPENSITY SCORE; CARE
AB There is a long-standing debate in the statistical, epidemiological, and econometric fields as to whether nonparametric estimation that uses machine learning in model fitting confers any meaningful advantage over simpler, parametric approaches in finite sample estimation of causal effects. We address the question: when estimating the effect of a treatment on an outcome, how much does the choice of nonparametric vs parametric estimation matter? Instead of answering this question with simulations that reflect a few chosen data scenarios, we propose a novel approach to compare estimators across a large number of data-generating mechanisms drawn from nonparametric models with semi-informative priors. We apply this proposed approach and compare the performance of two nonparametric estimators (Bayesian adaptive regression tree and a targeted minimum loss-based estimator) to two parametric estimators (a logistic regression-based plug-in estimator and a propensity score estimator) in terms of estimating the average treatment effect across thousands of data-generating mechanisms. We summarize performance in terms of bias, confidence interval coverage, and mean squared error. We find that the two nonparametric estimators can substantially reduce bias as compared to the two parametric estimators in large-sample settings characterized by interactions and nonlinearities while compromising very little in terms of performance even in simple, small-sample settings.

AB Sugarbeet is a deep-rooted crop in unrestricted soil profiles that can readily utilize stored soil water to reduce seasonal irrigation requirements. Soil water below 0.6 m is not commonly considered for irrigation scheduling due to the labor and expense of soil water monitoring at deeper depths and uncertainty in effective rooting depth and soil water holding capacity. Thermal-based crop water stress index (CWSI) irrigation scheduling for sugarbeet has the potential to overcome soil water monitoring limitations and facilitate utilization of stored soil water. In this study, canopy temperature of irrigated sugarbeet under full irrigation (FIT) and 25%FIT in 2014, 2015, 2017 and 2018 in southcentral Idaho and FIT and 60%FIT in 2018 in northwestern Wyoming USA was monitored from full cover through harvest along with meteorological conditions and soil water content. A neural network (NN) was used to predict well-watered canopy temperature based on 15-min average values for solar radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed collected-1 to +2.5 hours of solar noon (13:00 - 16:00 MDT). A linear regression driven physical model for estimating the difference between a non-transpiring canopy and air temperature resulted in a value of 13.7 degrees C for the meteorological conditions of the study. A daily CWSI value calculated as the average 15-min CWSI calculated between 13:00 and 16:00 MDT was well correlated with irrigation amounts and timing. The daily CWSI value provided a more responsive indication of crop water stress than soil water monitoring in deficit irrigation treatments. The methodology used to calculate a daily CWSI could be used in irrigation scheduling to utilize soil water storage without knowledge of soil depth, crop rooting depth, or deep (> 0.6 m) soil water monitoring.

AB This study performs detailed analyses to investigate and justify the utilization of maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm in photovoltaics (PV) and fuel cells. Two devices are parallelly analyzed to establish a comparative and contrasting study on the performance of the two technologies at MPP regime for a given operational condition. Direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) is chosen as a representative of the hydrogen fuel cells family. The operational variables affecting the electrical power in the devices, including temperature (for both devices), solar irradiance (for PV cells), and methanol concentration (for DMFC) are discussed, along with their similarities and differences. Voltage losses are addressed to gain insights into the electrical quality of each device at MPP regimes. Due to their pivotal role, fuel availability and cost, energy losses, overall efficiency, and cathode flooding are selected as crucial performance metrics to compare the two technologies at MPP. The results demonstrate that PV cells have a good voltage quality at MPP with an average retention of 87 % from open-circuit voltage Voc, whereas DMFC performance deteriorates at MPP, resulting in a significant decline with a loss of 61 % from Voc. Consistent with voltage loss results, fill factor analysis at MPP zones lead to the same conclusion wherein photovoltaics offer high fill factor of approximately 82%, whereas DMFC has lesser values that are below 40%. The maximum overall efficiency of PV cells is attained at the MPP zones, whereas optimal efficiencies do not match the MPP loci in fuel cells. Simulations show that DMFC is extremely prone to cathode flooding at MPP zones, where approximately 90% of pore spaces in the liquid distribution layer are occupied with water. Conversely, PV cells are completely free from such issues. Some recommendations for further advancement and investigation on the use of MPPT in both technologies are provided.

   population; COVID-19 pandemic
AB SignificanceWhat is already known on this subject? Home visitation programs have adopted technology for virtual service delivery during unforeseen circumstances that prevent in-person visits, such as COVID-19 restrictions.What does this study add? This qualitative study revealed positive attitudes and intentions of staff members of home visitation programs towards the use of digital learning technology in conjunction with home visits to enhance content related to early childhood obesity prevention for families participating in home visitation programs. Key suggestions to consider in the development of future childhood obesity digital interventions include appropriateness for the audience of interest (i.e., available in different languages, suitable literacy level), ease of use (i.e., simple, user-friendly, interactive features), and practical strategies to support the implementation (i.e., staff trainings, built-in flexibility). It is important to also consider technology-specific challenges that communities may face when incorporating technology in interventions (i.e., lack of access to devices, costs associated with reliable internet and data, compatibility of devices). Findings will help inform and guide the development of future childhood obesity digital interventions.
   IntroductionHome visitation programs that reach families of young children offer a unique opportunity for large-scale early childhood obesity prevention efforts. The objective of this qualitative research was to determine stakeholder attitudes, subjective norms, perceived ease of use and usefulness, behavioral control, and behavioral intentions towards utilizing technology in a home visitation program targeting early childhood obesity prevention.MethodsStaff from the Florida Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program (n = 27) were interviewed individually by a trained research assistant using a semi-structured script based on constructs from the Technology Acceptance Model and Theory of Planned Behavior. Demographic and technology use information were collected. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim, with data extracted and coded by two trained researchers using a theoretical thematic analysis approach.ResultsMost of the home visiting staff (78%) were white and non-Hispanic and employed for an average of 5 years with the program. Most staff (85%) indicated they were currently using videoconferencing for home visits. Themes and subthemes emerged, including positive attitudes towards technology as a flexible and time-efficient program alternative for childhood obesity prevention with recommendations to keep content short, at a low literacy level, and available in more than one language for ease of use. Participants recommended developing training tutorials to improve program implementation. Internet access and potential social disconnect were cited as concerns for using technology.DiscussionOverall, home visitation staff had positive attitudes and intentions for using technology in home visiting programs with families for early childhood obesity prevention.
