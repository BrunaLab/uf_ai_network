AB Artificial intelligence (AI) utilizes computer algorithms to carry out tasks with human-like intelligence. Convolutional neural networks, a type of deep learning AI, can classify basal cell carcinoma, seborrheic keratosis, and conventional nevi, highlighting the potential for deep learning algorithms to improve diagnostic workflow in dermatopathology of highly routine diagnoses. Additionally, convolutional neural networks can support the diagnosis of melanoma and may help predict disease outcomes. Capabilities of machine learning in dermatopathology can extend beyond clinical diagnosis to education and research. Intelligent tutoring systems can teach visual diagnoses in inflammatory dermatoses, with measurable cognitive effects on learners. Natural language interfaces can instruct dermatopathology trainees to produce diagnostic reports that capture relevant detail for diagnosis in compliance with guidelines. Furthermore, deep learning can power computation- and population-based research. However, there are many limitations of deep learning that need to be addressed before broad incorporation into clinical practice. The current potential of AI in dermatopathology is to supplement diagnosis, and dermatopathologist guidance is essential for the development of useful deep learning algorithms. Herein, the recent progress of AI in dermatopathology is reviewed with emphasis on how deep learning can influence diagnosis, education, and research.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques have been increasingly used in several fields to improve performance and the level of automation. In recent years, this use has exponentially increased due to the advancement of high-performance computing and the ever increasing size of data. One of such fields is that of hardware design-specifically the design of digital and analog integrated circuits, where AI/ ML techniques have been extensively used to address ever-increasing design complexity, aggressive time to market, and the growing number of ubiquitous interconnected devices. However, the security concerns and issues related to integrated circuit design have been highly overlooked. In this article, we summarize the state-of-the-art in AI/ML for circuit design/optimization, security and engineering challenges, research in security-aware computer-aided design/electronic design automation, and future research directions and needs for using AI/ML for security-aware circuit design.

AB Traditional plant breeding evaluation methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and costly. Accurate and rapid phenotypic trait data acquisition and analysis can improve genomic selection and accelerate cultivar development. In this work, a technique for data acquisition and image processing was developed utilizing small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), multispectral imaging, and deep learning convolutional neural networks to evaluate phenotypic characteristics on citrus crops. This low-cost and automated high-throughput phenotyping technique utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to: (i) detect, count, and geolocate trees and tree gaps; (ii) categorize trees based on their canopy size; (iii) develop individual tree health indices; and (iv) evaluate citrus varieties and rootstocks. The proposed remote sensing technique was able to detect and count citrus trees in a grove of 4,931 trees, with precision and recall of 99.9% and 99.7%, respectively, estimate their canopy size with overall accuracy of 85.5%, and detect, count, and geolocate tree gaps with a precision and recall of 100% and 94.6%, respectively. This UAV-based technique provides a consistent, more direct, cost-effective, and rapid method to evaluate phenotypic characteristics of citrus varieties and rootstocks.

AB Advancements in computing and data from the near universal acceptance and implementation of electronic health records has been formative for the growth of personalized, automated, and immediate patient care models that were not previously possible. Artificial intelligence (AI) and its subfields of machine learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning are well-suited to deal with such data. The authors in this paper review current applications of AI in clinical medicine and discuss the most likely future contributions that AI will provide to the healthcare industry. For instance, in response to the need to risk stratify patients, appropriately cultivated and curated data can assist decision-makers in stratifying preoperative patients into risk categories, as well as categorizing the severity of ailments and health for non-operative patients admitted to hospitals. Previous overt, traditional vital signs and laboratory values that are used to signal alarms for an acutely decompensating patient may be replaced by continuously monitoring and updating AI tools that can pick up early imperceptible patterns predicting subtle health deterioration. Furthermore, AI may help overcome challenges with multiple outcome optimization limitations or sequential decision-making protocols that limit individualized patient care. Despite these tremendously helpful advancements, the data sets that AI models train on and develop have the potential for misapplication and thereby create concerns for application bias. Subsequently, the mechanisms governing this disruptive innovation must be understood by clinical decision-makers to prevent unnecessary harm. This need will force physicians to change their educational infrastructure to facilitate understanding AI platforms, modeling, and limitations to best acclimate practice in the age of AI. By performing a thorough narrative review, this paper examines these specific AI applications, limitations, and requisites while reviewing a few examples of major data sets that are being cultivated and curated in the US.

AB Purpose of review Acute kidney injury (AKI) affects nearly 60% of all patients admitted to ICUs. Large volumes of clinical, monitoring and laboratory data produced in ICUs allow the application of artificial intelligence analytics. The purpose of this article is to assimilate and critically evaluate recently published literature regarding artificial intelligence applications for predicting, diagnosing and subphenotyping AKI among critically ill patients. Recent findings Among recent studies regarding artificial intelligence implementations for predicting, diagnosing and subphenotyping AKI among critically ill patients, there are many promising models, but few had external validation, clinical interpretability and high predictive performance. Deep learning techniques leveraging multimodal clinical data show great potential to provide continuous, accurate, early predictions of AKI risk, which could be implemented clinically to optimize preventive and early therapeutic management strategies. Use of consensus criteria, standard definitions and common data models could facilitate access to machine learning-ready data sets for external validation. The lack of interpretability, explainability, fairness and transparency of artificial intelligence models hinder their entrustment and clinical implementation; compliance with standardized reporting guidelines can mitigate these challenges.

AB Participating in online communities has significant benefits to students learning in terms of students' motivation, persistence, and learning outcomes. However, maintaining and supporting online learning communities is very challenging and requires tremendous work. Automatic support is desirable in this situation. The purpose of this work is to explore the use of deep learning algorithms for automatic text generation in providing emotional and community support for a massive online learning community, Scratch. Particularly, state-of-art deep learning language models GPT-2 and recurrent neural network (RNN) are trained using two million comments from the online learning community. We then conduct both a readability test and human evaluation on the automatically generated results for offering support to the online students. The results show that the GPT-2 language model can provide timely and human-written like replies in a style genuine to the data set and context for offering related support.

AB Industry 4.0 aims to create a modern industrial system by introducing technologies, such as cloud computing, intelligent robotics, and wireless sensor networks. In this article, we consider the multichannel access and task offloading problem in mobile-edge computing (MEC)-enabled industry 4.0 and describe this problem in multiagent environment. To solve this problem, we propose a novel multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) scheme. The solution enables edge devices (EDs) to cooperate with each other, which can significantly reduce the computation delay and improve the channel access success rate. Extensive simulation results with different system parameters reveal that the proposed scheme could reduce computation delay by 33.38% and increase the channel access success rate by 14.88% and channel utilization by 3.24% compared to the traditional single-agent reinforcement learning method.

AB Background: Low delivery efficiency of nanoparticles (NPs) to the tumor is a critical barrier in the field of cancer nanomedicine. Strategies on how to improve NP tumor delivery efficiency remain to be determined.
   Methods: This study analyzed the roles of NP physicochemical properties, tumor models, and cancer types in NP tumor delivery efficiency using multiple machine learning and artificial intelligence methods, using data from a recently published Nano-Tumor Database that contains 376 datasets generated from a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model.
   Results: The deep neural network model adequately predicted the delivery efficiency of different NPs to different tumors and it outperformed all other machine learning methods; including random forest, support vector machine, linear regression, and bagged model methods. The adjusted determination coefficients (R-2) in the full training dataset were 0.92, 0.77, 0.77 and 0.76 for the maximum delivery efficiency (DEmax), delivery efficiency at 24 h (DE24), at 168 h (DE168), and at the last sampling time (DETlast). The corresponding R-2 values in the test dataset were 0.70, 0.46, 0.33 and 0.63, respectively. Also, this study showed that cancer type was an important determinant for the deep neural network model in predicting the tumor delivery efficiency across all endpoints (19-29%). Among all physicochemical properties, the Zeta potential and core material played a greater role than other properties, such as the type, shape, and targeting strategy.
   Conclusion: This study provides a quantitative model to improve the design of cancer nanomedicine with greater tumor delivery efficiency. These results help to improve our understanding of the causes of low NP tumor delivery efficiency. This study demonstrates the feasibility of integrating artificial intelligence with PBPK modeling approaches to study cancer nanomedicine.

AB Artificial intelligence, as a nonhuman entity, is increasingly used to inform, direct, or supplant nursing care and clinical decision-making. The boundaries between human- and nonhuman-driven nursing care are blurred with the advent of sensors, wearables, camera devices, and humanoid robots at such an accelerated pace that the critical evaluation of its influence on patient safety has not been fully assessed. Since the pivotal release of To Err is Human, patient safety is being challenged by the dynamic healthcare environment like never before, with nursing at a critical juncture to steer the course of artificial intelligence integration in clinical decision-making. This paper presents an overview of artificial intelligence and its application in healthcare and highlights the implications which affect nursing as a profession, including perspectives on nursing education and training recommendations. The legal and policy challenges which emerge when artificial intelligence influences the risk of clinical errors and safety issues are discussed.

AB Nanoparticles (NPs) can be designed for targeted delivery in cancer nanomedicine, but the challenge is a low delivery efficiency (DE) to the tumor site. Understanding the impact of NPs' physicochemical properties on target tissue distribution and tumor DE can help improve the design of nanomedicines. Multiple machine learning and artificial intelligence models, including linear regression, support vector machine, random forest, gradient boosting, and deep neural networks (DNN), were trained and validated to predict tissue distribution and tumor delivery based on NPs' physicochemical properties and tumor therapeutic strategies with the dataset from NanoTumor Database. Compared to other machine learning models, the DNN model had superior predictions of DE to tumors and major tissues. The determination coefficients (R2) for the test datasets were 0.41, 0.42, 0.45, 0.79, 0.87, and 0.83 for DE in tumor, heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney, respectively. All the R2 and root mean squared error (RMSE) results of the test datasets were similar to the 5-fold cross validation results. Feature importance analysis showed that the core material of NPs played an important role in output predictions among all physicochemical properties. Furthermore, multiple NP formulations with greater DE to the tumor were determined by the DNN model. To facilitate model applications, the final model was converted to a web dashboard. This model could serve as a high-throughput pre-screening tool to support the design of new and efficient nanomedicines with greater tumor DE and serve as an alternative tool to reduce, refine, and partially replace animal experimentation in cancer nanomedicine research.

AB Deep neural networks (DNNs) have transformed the field of computer vision and currently constitute some of the best models for representations learned via hierarchical processing in the human brain. In medical imaging, these models have shown human-level performance and even higher in the early diagnosis of a wide range of diseases. However, the goal is often not only to accurately predict group membership or diagnose but also to provide explanations that support the model decision in a context that a human can readily interpret. The limited transparency has hindered the adoption of DNN algorithms across many domains. Numerous explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques have been developed to peer inside the "black box " and make sense of DNN models, taking somewhat divergent approaches. Here, we suggest that these methods may be considered in light of the interpretation goal, including functional or mechanistic interpretations, developing archetypal class instances, or assessing the relevance of certain features or mappings on a trained model in a post-hoc capacity. We then focus on reviewing recent applications of post-hoc relevance techniques as applied to neuroimaging data. Moreover, this article suggests a method for comparing the reliability of XAI methods, especially in deep neural networks, along with their advantages and pitfalls.

AB In recent years, strategies for load monitoring have been proposed to mitigate power consumption. It has been found, in several reported studies, that as more information is provided for consumers about their electricity consumption, more power energy conservation will occur. In this way, Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) has been studied and applied in real-life applications. It consists of detecting and classifying appliances on/off states by measuring electrical signals only at one location of the residential consumer. Several studies have been made using different techniques to improve the accuracy of this strategy. In this paper electromagnetic transients are taking into account and, a performance analysis between cutting-edge artificial classifiers is made. It has been found that 1D convolutional neural networks perform better for this case and electrical current signals are more suitable for NILM, once it carries more features than voltage and power signals.

AB The success of brain-machine interfaces (BMI) is enabled by the remarkable ability of the brain to incorporate the artificial neuroprosthetic 'tool' into its own cognitive space and use it as an extension of the user's body. Unlike other tools, neuroprosthetics create a shared space that seamlessly spans the user's internal goal representation of the world and the external physical environment enabling a much deeper human-tool symbiosis. A key factor in the transformation of 'simple tools' into 'intelligent tools' is the concept of co-adaptation where the tool becomes functionally involved in the extraction and definition of the user's goals. Recent advancements in the neuroscience and engineering of neuroprosthetics are providing a blueprint for how new co-adaptive designs based on reinforcement learning change the nature of a user's ability to accomplish tasks that were not possible using conventional methodologies. By designing adaptive controls and artificial intelligence into the neural interface, tools can become active assistants in goal-directed behavior and further enhance human performance in particular for the disabled population. This paper presents recent advances in computational and neural systems Supporting the development of symbiotic neuroprosthetic assistants. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Plant diseases can significantly reduce crop yield and product quality. Visual inspections of plants by human observers for disease identification are time-consuming, costly, and prone to error. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have created opportunities for the rapid diagnosis and non-destructive classification of plant pathogens. Several machine vision techniques have been developed to identify and classify plant diseases automatically based on the morphology of specific symptoms. The use of deep learning models has achieved acceptable disease classification results, but they require large datasets for training, which can be labor-intensive, time-consuming, and computationally costly This problem can be solved, to a point, by using data augmentation techniques and generative AI in order to increase the size of the datasets. Furthermore, a combination of deep feature extraction and classification by machine learning was used for accurate disease detection and classification. In some cases, traditional base classifiers trained with small datasets including basic shape, color, and texture features can be feasible for the efficient identification of plant diseases. The performance of such classifiers depends primarily on the features extracted from images; therefore, feature extraction plays a vital role in identifying diseases. Feature engineering, a process to identify the most relevant variables from raw data in order to develop an efficient predictive model, is explored in this paper.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to using technologies to simulate human cognition to solve a specific problem. The rapid development of AI in the health sector has been attributed to the improvement of computing speed, exponential increase in data production, and routine data collection. In this paper, we review the current applications of AI for oral and maxillofacial (OMF) cosmetic surgery to provide surgeons with the fundamental technical elements needed to understand its potential. AI plays an increasingly important role in OMF cosmetic surgery in various settings, and its usage may raise ethical issues. In addition to machine learning algorithms (a subtype of AI), convolutional neural networks (a subtype of deep learning) are widely used in OMF cosmetic surgeries. Depending on their complexity, these networks can extract and process the elementary characteristics of an image. They are, therefore, commonly used in the diagnostic process for medical images and facial photos. AI algorithms have been used to assist surgeons with diagnosis, therapeutic decisions, preoperative planning, and outcome prediction and evaluation. AI algorithms complement human skills while minimizing shortcomings through their capabilities to learn, classify, predict, and detect. This algorithm should, however, be rigorously evaluated clinically, and a systematic ethical reflection should be conducted regarding data protection, diversity, and transparency. It is possible to revolutionize the practice of functional and aesthetic surgeries with 3D simulation models and AI models. Planning, decision-making, and evaluation during and after surgery can be improved with simulation systems. A surgical AI model can also perform time-consuming or challenging tasks for surgeons.

AB Stability certification is critical before controllers are rolled out onto real systems. Despite recent progress in the development of neural network systems for feedback-optimal control, enforcement and assessment of the stability of the trained controllers remains an open problem. In this investigation, a comprehensive framework is developed to achieve certifiably stable fuel-optimal feedback control of pinpoint landers in four different formulations of varying complexity. By preconditioning a deep neural network policy and a deep neural network Lyapunov function, and then applying a constrained parameter optimization approach, we are able to address the shape mismatch problem posed by the standard sum-of-squares Lyapunov function and achieve feedback-optimal control. Phase-space plots of the Lyapunov derivative show the level of certificate enforcement achieved by the developed algorithms, and Monte Carlo simulations are performed to demonstrate the stable, optimal, real-time feedback control provided by the policy.

AB The critical barrier for clinical translation of cancer nanomedicine stems from the inefficient delivery of nanoparticles (NPs) to target solid tumors. Rapid growth of computational power, new machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches provide new tools to address this challenge. In this study, we established an AIassisted physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model by integrating an AI-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model with a PBPK model to simulate tumor-targeted delivery efficiency (DE) and biodistribution of various NPs. The AI-based QSAR model was developed using machine learning and deep neural network algorithms that were trained with datasets from a published "Nano-Tumor Database" to predict critical input parameters of the PBPK model. The PBPK model with optimized NP cellular uptake kinetic parameters was used to predict the maximum delivery efficiency (DEmax) and DE at 24 (DE24) and 168 h (DE168) of different NPs in the tumor after intravenous injection and achieved a determination coefficient of R2 = 0.83 [root mean squared error (RMSE) = 3.01] for DE24, R2 = 0.56 (RMSE = 2.27) for DE168, and R2 = 0.82 (RMSE = 3.51) for DEmax. The AI-PBPK model predictions correlated well with available experimentallymeasured pharmacokinetic profiles of different NPs in tumors after intravenous injection (R2 & GE; 0.70 for 133 out of 288 datasets). This AI-based PBPK model provides an efficient screening tool to rapidly predict delivery efficiency of a NP based on its physicochemical properties without relying on an animal training dataset.

AB Objective: To conduct a systematic scoping review of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) models that use real-world electronic health record data, categorize these techniques according to different biomedical applications, identify gaps of current studies, and suggest future research directions.
   Materials and Methods: We searched MEDLINE, IEEE Xplore, and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library to identify relevant papers published between January 1, 2009 and May 1, 2019. We summarized these studies based on the year of publication, prediction tasks, machine learning algorithm, dataset(s) used to build the models, the scope, category, and evaluation of the XAI methods. We further assessed the reproducibility of the studies in terms of the availability of data and code and discussed open issues and challenges.
   Results: Forty-two articles were included in this review. We reported the research trend and most-studied diseases. We grouped XAI methods into 5 categories: knowledge distillation and rule extraction (N=13), intrinsically interpretable models (N=9), data dimensionality reduction (N=8), attention mechanism (N=7), and feature interaction and importance (N=5).
   Discussion: XAI evaluation is an open issue that requires a deeper focus in the case of medical applications. We also discuss the importance of reproducibility of research work in this field, as well as the challenges and opportunities of XAI from 2 medical professionals' point of view.
   Conclusion: Based on our review, we found that XAI evaluation in medicine has not been adequately and formally practiced. Reproducibility remains a critical concern. Ample opportunities exist to advance XAI research in medicine.

AB Objective The primary objective of this study is to investigate various applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and statistical methodologies for analyzing and managing peritoneal metastases (PM) caused by gastrointestinal cancers.Methods Relevant keywords and search criteria were comprehensively researched on PubMed and Google Scholar to identify articles and reviews related to the topic. The AI approaches considered were conventional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, and the relevant statistical approaches included biostatistics and logistic models.Results The systematic literature review yielded nearly 30 articles meeting the predefined criteria. Analyses of these studies showed that AI methodologies consistently outperformed traditional statistical approaches. In the AI approaches, DL consistently produced the most precise results, while classical ML demonstrated varied performance but maintained high predictive accuracy. The sample size was the recurring factor that increased the accuracy of the predictions for models of the same type.Conclusions AI and statistical approaches can detect PM developing among patients with gastrointestinal cancers. Therefore, if clinicians integrated these approaches into diagnostics and prognostics, they could better analyze and manage PM, enhancing clinical decision-making and patients' outcomes. Collaboration across multiple institutions would also help in standardizing methods for data collection and allowing consistent results.

AB IntroductionArtificial intelligence can recognize complex patterns in large datasets. It is a promising technology to advance heart failure practice, as many decisions rely on expert opinions in the absence of high-quality data-driven evidence. MethodsWe searched Embase, Web of Science, and PubMed databases for articles containing "artificial intelligence," "machine learning," or "deep learning" and any of the phrases "heart transplantation," "ventricular assist device," or "cardiogenic shock" from inception until August 2022. We only included original research addressing post heart transplantation (HTx) or mechanical circulatory support (MCS) clinical care. Review and data extraction were performed in accordance with PRISMA-Scr guidelines. ResultsOf 584 unique publications detected, 31 met the inclusion criteria. The majority focused on outcome prediction post HTx (n = 13) and post durable MCS (n = 7), as well as post HTx and MCS management (n = 7, n = 3, respectively). One study addressed temporary mechanical circulatory support. Most studies advocated for rapid integration of AI into clinical practice, acknowledging potential improvements in management guidance and reliability of outcomes prediction. There was a notable paucity of external data validation and integration of multiple data modalities. ConclusionOur review showed mounting innovation in AI application in management of MCS and HTx, with the largest evidence showing improved mortality outcome prediction.

AB Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the abil-ity of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform reasoning tasks commonly associated with intel-ligent beings. Powered by novel and affordable software and hardware capabilities, AI is finding its way into dairy farms. The purpose of this review is to give examples of re-search on AI for dairy farms and highlight some emerging opportunities. Many AI applications are based on machine learning, including the technique of deep learning. Sources: We used literature sources and our own expe-riences with AI applications in dairy farms. Synthesis: We found that machine-learning methods enable applications such as real-time analysis of video images to identify cattle, measure body condition and temperature, and detect changes in feed topography to measure feed availability and intake. Changes in behavior can be detected as early warning alerts for disease such as lameness or as an indication of estrus. Such AI ap-plications can mimic human reasoning and enhance hu-man tasks. Machine-learning methods may also be able to use heterogeneous data sets to predict future performance such as fertility. For example, predictions of conception rates may be improved by combining health events, chang-es in body energy reserves, genetic data, behavioral data, milk analyses, and environmental information. Perhaps AI methods could be used to monitor compliance of execution of protocols in dairy farms and inform training. Conclusions and Applications: Artificial intelli-gence, made possible with advances in hardware and soft-ware, will make intelligent use of new big data a reality and will change the dairy sector by enabling improved work environments and removing or minimizing the need for manual human processing of repetitive tasks. A hurdle for development and application of some AI is the problem that various dairy data often exist in silos that are not connected.

AB The Short-Term Load Forecasting (STLF) is a pre-eminent task for reliable power generation and electrical load dispatching in the power system. Numerous machine-learning and deep-learning forecasting algorithms have been presented in literature for performing an accurate electrical load forecast. However, the complicated structure of machine-learning and deep-learning multi-layer and with increased filter size architectures provoke the overfitting issue, which degrades the performance of STLF engines in the presence of highly diversified weather and temporal variations. This paper proposes a novel two-stage Encoder-Decoder (ED) network with improved generalization capability and forecasting accuracy. The proposed architecture is based on Short Receptive field based Dilated Causal Convolutional (SRDCC) network in the first stage and Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network in the second stage. Using real valued data, the proposed ED architecture is quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed in comparison with state-of-the-art machine-learning and hybrid deep-learning STLF models. The evaluation matrix used for the comparison consists of six evaluation parameters. The extensive experimentation for multi-step ahead STLF validates the efficiency of the proposed technique in terms of accuracy in comparison with other employed models. The CNN-LSTM revealed to have best performance among all other implemented parametric and non-parametric forecasting models; however, the proposed ED architecture proves to be 35% more accurate compared to CNN-LSTM and have the tendency to capture the local trends in an electrical load pattern more accurately. Moreover, a detailed comparative analysis on the computational complexity of the proposed ED architecture is also conducted to show the real implementation prospect.

AB In this paper, we consider the approach of applying state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms to simulate some financial markets. In this case, we choose the cryptocurrency market based on the assumption that such markets more active today. As a rule, they have more volatility, attracting riskier traders. Considering classic trading strategies, we also introduce an agent with a self-learning strategy. To model the behavior of such agent, we use deep reinforcement learning algorithms, namely Deep Deterministic policy gradient. Next, we develop an agent-based model with following strategies. With this model, we will be able to evaluate the main market statistics, named stylized-facts. Finally, we conduct a comparative analysis of results for constructed model with outcomes of previously proposed models, as well as with the characteristics of real market. As a result, we conclude that our model with a self-learning agent gives a better approximation to the real market than a model with classical agents. In particular, unlike the model with classical agents, the model with a self-learning agent turns out to be not so heavy-tailed. Thus, we demonstrate that for a complete understanding of market processes simulation models should take into account self-learning agents that have a significant presence at modern stock markets.

AB Plasma half-life is a crucial pharmacokinetic parameter for estimating extralabel withdrawal intervals of drugs to ensure the safety of food products derived from animals. This study focuses on developing a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model incorporating multiple machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms, and aims to predict the plasma half-lives of drugs in 6 food animals, including cattle, chickens, goats, sheep, swine, and turkeys. By integrating 4 machine learning algorithms with 5 molecular descriptor types, 20 QSAR models were developed using data from the Food Animal Residue Avoidance Databank (FARAD) Comparative Pharmacokinetic Database. The deep neural network (DNN) algorithm demonstrated the best prediction ability of plasma half-lives. The DNN model with all descriptors achieved superior performance with a high coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.82 +/- 0.19 in 5-fold cross-validation on the training sets and an R2 of 0.67 on the independent test set, indicating accurate predictions and good generalizability. The final model was converted to a user-friendly web dashboard to facilitate its wide application by the scientific community. This machine learning-based QSAR model serves as a valuable tool for predicting drug plasma half-lives and extralabel withdrawal intervals in 6 common food animals based on physicochemical properties. It also provides a foundation to develop more advanced models to predict the tissue half-life of drugs in food animals.

AB An approximate optimal policy is developed for a pursuing agent to indirectly regulate an evading agent coupled by an unknown interaction dynamic. Approximate dynamic programming is used to design a controller for the pursuing agent to optimally influence the evading agent to a goal location. Since the interaction dynamic between the agents is unknown, integral concurrent learning is used to update a Lyapunov-based deep neural network to facilitate sustained learning and system identification. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is used to show uniformly ultimately bounded convergence. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the developed method.

AB The Copernicus Sentinel -2 multispectral imagery data may be aggregated to extract large-scale, bare soil, reflectance composites, which enable soil mapping applications. In this paper, this approach was tested in the German federal state of Bavaria, to provide estimations for soil organic carbon (SOC). Different temporal ranges were considered for the generation of the composites, including multi -annual and seasonal ranges. A novel multichannel convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed. By leveraging the advantages of deep learning techniques, it utilizes complementary information from different spectral pre-treatment techniques. The SOC predictions indicated little dissimilarity amongst the different composites, with the best performance attained for the six -year composite containing only spring months (RMSE = 12.03 g C & sdot; kg - 1 , R 2 = 0.64, RPIQ = 0.89). It has been demonstrated that these outcomes outperform other well-known machine learning techniques. An ablation analysis was accordingly performed to evaluate the interplay of the CNN ' s different components to disentangle the advantages of each aspect of the proposed framework. Finally, a DUal inPut deep LearnIng architecture, named DUPLICITE, is proposed, which concatenates deep spectral features derived from the CNN mentioned earlier, as well as topographical and environmental covariates through an artificial neural network (ANN) to exploit their complementarity. The proposed approach was demonstrated to provide an improvement in the overall prediction performance (RMSE = 11.60 gC & sdot; kg - 1 , R 2 = 0.67, RPIQ = 0.92).

Machine learning techniques have powered many aspects of medical investigation and clinical practice. Recently, deep learning is emerging as a leading machine learning tool in computer vision and has attracted considerable attention in biomedical image analysis. In this paper, we provide a snapshot of this fast-growing field, specifically for microscopy image analysis. We briefly introduce the popular deep neural networks and summarize current deep learning achievements in various tasks, such as detection, segmentation, and classification in microscopy image analysis. In particular, we explain the architectures and the principles of convolutional neural networks, fully convolutional networks, recurrent neural networks, stacked autoencoders, and deep belief networks, and interpret their formulations or modelings for specific tasks on various microscopy images. In addition, we discuss the open challenges and the potential trends of future research in microscopy image analysis using deep learning.

AB The meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) framework, which involves RL over multiple timescales, has been successful in training deep RL models that generalize to new environments. It has been hypothesized that the prefrontal cortex may mediate meta-RL in the brain, but the evidence is scarce. Here we show that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) mediates meta-RL. We trained mice and deep RL models on a probabilistic reversal learning task across sessions during which they improved their trial-by-trial RL policy through meta-learning. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-dependent synaptic plasticity in OFC was necessary for this meta-learning but not for the within-session trial-by-trial RL in experts. After meta-learning, OFC activity robustly encoded value signals, and OFC inactivation impaired the RL behaviors. Longitudinal tracking of OFC activity revealed that meta-learning gradually shapes population value coding to guide the ongoing behavioral policy. Our results indicate that two distinct RL algorithms with distinct neural mechanisms and timescales coexist in OFC to support adaptive decision-making.
   The authors show that neural activity and synaptic plasticity in the orbitofrontal cortex mediate multiple timescales of reinforcement learning (RL) for meta-RL, which parallels a form of meta-RL in artificial intelligence.

AB The COVID-19 virus has swept the world and brought great impact to various fields, gaining wide attention from all walks of life since the end of 2019. At present, although the global epidemic situation is leveling off and vaccine doses have been administered in a large amount, confirmed cases are still emerging around the world. To make up for the missed diagnosis caused by the uncertainty of nucleic acid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, utilizing lung CT examination as a combined detection method to improve the diagnostic rate becomes a necessity. Our research considered the time-consuming and labor-intensive characteristics of the traditional CT analyzing process, and developed an efficient deep learning framework named CSGBBNet to solve the binary classification task of COVID-19 images based on a COVID-Seg model for image preprocessing and a GBBNet for classification. The five runs with random seed on the test set showed our novel framework can rapidly analyze CT scan images and give out effective results for assisting COVID-19 detection, with the mean accuracy of 98.49 +/- 1.23%, the sensitivity of 99.00 +/- 2.00%, the specificity of 97.95 +/- 2.51%, the precision of 98.10 +/- 2.61%, and the F1 score of 98.51 +/- 1.22%. Moreover, our model CSGBBNet performs better when compared with seven previous state-of-the-art methods. In this research, the aim is to link together biomedical research and artificial intelligence and provide some insights into the field of COVID-19 detection.

AB Deep hierarchical representations of the data have been found out to provide better informative features for several machine learning applications. In addition, multilayer neural networks surprisingly tend to achieve better performance when they are subject to an unsupervised pretraining. The booming of deep learning motivates researchers to identify the factors that contribute to its success. One possible reason identified is the flattening of manifold-shaped data in higher layers of neural networks. However, it is not clear how to measure the flattening of such manifold-shaped data and what amount of flattening a deep neural network can achieve. For the first time, this paper provides quantitative evidence to validate the flattening hypothesis. To achieve this, we propose a few quantities for measuring manifold entanglement under certain assumptions and conduct experiments with both synthetic and real-world data. Our experimental results validate the proposition and lead to new insights on deep learning.

AB Learned optimization algorithms are promising approaches to inverse problems by leveraging advanced numerical optimization schemes and deep neural network techniques in machine learning. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network architecture imitating an extra proximal gradient algorithm to solve a general class of inverse problems with a focus on applications in image reconstruction. The proposed network features learned regularization that incorporates adaptive sparsification mappings, robust shrinkage selections, and nonlocal operators to improve solution quality. Numerical results demonstrate the improved efficiency and accuracy of the proposed network over several state-of-the-art methods on a variety of test problems.

TI Identifying Mg II narrow absorption lines with deep learning
SO MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY

DT Article

ID DIGITAL-SKY-SURVEY; SYSTEMS
AB Metal absorption line systems in distant quasar spectra are probes of the history of the gas content in the universe. The Mg II lambda lambda 2796, 2803 doublet is one of themost important absorption lines since it is a proxy of the star formation rate and a tracer of the cold gas associated with high-redshift galaxies. Machine learning algorithms have been used to detect absorption lines systems in large sky surveys, such as principal component analysis, Gaussian process, and decision trees. A very powerful algorithm in the field of machine learning called deep neural networks, or 'deep learning', is a new structure of neural network that automatically extracts semantic features from raw data and represents them at a high level. In this paper, we apply a deep convolutional neural network for absorption line detection. We use the previously published DR7 Mg II catalogue as the training and validation sample and the DR12 Mg II catalogue as the test set. Our deep learning algorithm is capable of detecting Mg II absorption lines with an accuracy of similar to 94 per cent. It takes only similar to 9 s to analyse similar to 50 000 quasar spectra with our deep neural network, which is ten thousand times faster than traditional methods, while preserving high accuracy with little human interference. Our study shows that MgII absorption line detection accuracy of a deep neutral network model strongly depends on the filter size in the filter layer of the neural network, and the best results are obtained when the filter size closely matches the absorption feature size.

AB Technological and methodological advances in remote sensing and machine learning have created new opportunities for advancing wildlife surveys. We assembled a Community of Practice (CoP) to capitalize on these developments to explore improvements to the efficiency and effectiveness of aerial wildlife monitoring from a management perspective. The core objective of the CoP is to organize the development and testing of remote sensing and machine learning methods to improve aerial wildlife population surveys that support management decisions. Beginning in 2020, the CoP collaboratively identified the natural resource management decisions that are informed by wildlife survey data with a focus on waterbirds and marine wildlife. We surveyed our membership to establish 1) what management decisions they were using wildlife count data to inform; 2) how these count data were collected prior to the advent of remote sensing/machine learning methods; 3) the impetus for transitioning to a remote sensing/machine learning methodological framework; and 4) the challenges practitioners face in transitioning to this framework. This paper documents these findings and identifies research priorities for moving toward operational remote sensing-based wildlife surveys in service of wildlife management.

AB The advent of artificial intelligence and Internet of Things has led to the seamless transition turning the big data into the big knowledge. The deep learning models, which assimilate knowledge from large-scale data, can he regarded as an alternative but promising modality of knowledge for artificial intelligence services. Yet, the compression, storage, and communication of the deep learning models towards better knowledge services, especially over networks, pose a set of challenging problems on both industrial and academic realms. This paper presents the deep learning model communication paradigm based on multiple model compression, which greatly exploits the redundancy among multiple deep learning models in different application scenarios. We analyze the potential and demonstrate the promise of the compression strategy for deep learning model communication through a set of experiments. Moreover, the interoperability in deep learning model communication, which is enabled based on the standardization of compact deep learning model representation, is also discussed and envisioned.

AB The design of enzyme catalytic stability is of great significance in medicine and industry. However, traditional methods are time-consuming and costly. Hence, a growing number of complementary computational tools have been developed, e.g. ESMFold, AlphaFold2, Rosetta, RosettaFold, FireProt, ProteinMPNN. They are proposed for algorithm-driven and data-driven enzyme design through artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms including natural language processing, machine learning, deep learning, variational autoencoder/generative adversarial network, message passing neural network (MPNN). In addition, the challenges of design of enzyme catalytic stability include insufficient structured data, large sequence search space, inaccurate quantitative prediction, low efficiency in experimental validation and a cumbersome design process. The first principle of the enzyme catalytic stability design is to treat amino acids as the basic element. By designing the sequence of an enzyme, the flexibility and stability of the structure are adjusted, thus controlling the catalytic stability of the enzyme in a specific industrial environment or in an organism. Common indicators of design goals include the change in denaturation energy (Delta Delta G), melting temperature (Delta Tm), optimal temperature (Topt), optimal pH (pHopt), etc. In this review, we summarized and evaluated the enzyme design in catalytic stability by AI in terms of mechanism, strategy, data, labeling, coding, prediction, testing, unit, integration and prospect.

AB Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States as well as worldwide. Radiologists and physicians experience heavy daily workloads, thus are at high risk for burn-out. To alleviate this burden, this narrative literature review compares the performance of four different artificial intelligence (AI) models in lung nodule cancer detection, as well as their performance to physicians/radiologists reading accuracy.
   A total of 648 articles were selected by two experienced physicians with over 10 years of experience in the fields of pulmonary critical care, and hospital medicine. The data bases used to search and select the articles are PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane library, Google Scholar, Web of science, IEEEXplore, and DBLP. The articles selected range from the years between 2008 and 2019. Four out of 648 articles were selected using the following inclusion criteria: 1) 18-65 years old, 2) CT chest scans, 2) lung nodule, 3) lung cancer, 3) deep learning, 4) ensemble and 5) classic methods. The exclusion criteria used in this narrative review include: 1) age greater than 65 years old, 2) positron emission tomography (PET) hybrid scans, 3) chest X-ray (CXR) and 4) genomics. The model performance outcomes metrics are measured and evaluated in sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve, and the area under the curve (AUC).
   This hybrid deep-learning model is a state-of-the-art architecture, with high-performance accuracy and low false-positive results. Future studies, comparing each model accuracy at depth is key. Automated physician-assist systems as this model in this review article help preserve a quality doctor-patient relationship.

AB Objectives: This scoping review aimed to summarize the available literature on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in pharmacy education and identify gaps where additional research is needed. Findings: Seven studies specifically addressing the use of AI in pharmacy education were identified. Of these 7 studies, 5 focused on AI use in the context of teaching and learning, 1 on the prediction of academic performance for admissions, and the final study focused on using AI text generation to elucidate the benefits and limitations of ChatGPT use in pharmacy education. Summary: There are currently a limited number of available publications that describe AI use in pharmacy education. Several challenges exist regarding the use of AI in pharmacy education, including the need for faculty expertise and time, limited generalizability of tools, limited outcomes data, and several legal and ethical concerns. As AI use increases and implementation becomes more standardized, opportunities will be created for the inclusion of AI in pharmacy education.

AB Background: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care has grown exponentially with the promise of facilitating biomedical research and enhancing diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, disease prevention, and health care delivery. We aim to examine the current state, limitations, and future directions of AI in thyroidology.Summary: AI has been explored in thyroidology since the 1990s, and currently, there is an increasing interest in applying AI to improve the care of patients with thyroid nodules (TNODs), thyroid cancer, and functional or autoimmune thyroid disease. These applications aim to automate processes, improve the accuracy and consistency of diagnosis, personalize treatment, decrease the burden for health care professionals, improve access to specialized care in areas lacking expertise, deepen the understanding of subtle pathophysiologic patterns, and accelerate the learning curve of less experienced clinicians. There are promising results for many of these applications. Yet, most are in the validation or early clinical evaluation stages. Only a few are currently adopted for risk stratification of TNODs by ultrasound and determination of the malignant nature of indeterminate TNODs by molecular testing. Challenges of the currently available AI applications include the lack of prospective and multicenter validations and utility studies, small and low diversity of training data sets, differences in data sources, lack of explainability, unclear clinical impact, inadequate stakeholder engagement, and inability to use outside of the research setting, which might limit the value of their future adoption.Conclusions: AI has the potential to improve many aspects of thyroidology; however, addressing the limitations affecting the suitability of AI interventions in thyroidology is a prerequisite to ensure that AI provides added value for patients with thyroid disease.

AB Key advances
   A deep recurrent neural network model using data from electronic health records enables the prediction of inpatient episodes of acute kidney injury (AKI) with lead times of up to 48 hours5. Integrating intraoperative physiological signals into an AKI risk model that dynamically integrates preoperative and intraoperative data improves the prediction of postoperative AKI6. A convolutional deep learning model enables the noninvasive classification of chronic kidney disease stage and estimated glomerular filtration rate using kidney ultrasound images8. A convolutional neural network trained for multiclass segmentation enables automated analysis of transplant biopsy and nephrectomy samples9.
   Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used to improve diagnosis and prognostication for acute and chronic kidney diseases. Studies with this objective published in 2019 relied on a variety of available data sources, including electronic health records, intraoperative physiological signals, kidney ultrasound imaging, and digitized biopsy specimens.

AB The next generation of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled nephrology will leverage generalist models that link diverse multimodal patient data with the linguistic and emergent capabilities of large language models. In 2023, advances in AI that linked novel unstructured data with physiological and clinical characteristics moved the field closer to realizing this vision.
   The launch of ChatGPT1 was an important step in the democratization of artificial intelligence (AI); large language models will have a critical role in shaping future research and AI-augmented clinical practice in nephrology.An automated quantitative histopathological morphometry approach, termed pathomics, reliably predicted the progression of kidney diseases8; this technology represents an important step towards precision medicine.An AI system reliably estimated biomarkers of systemic diseases, including estimated glomerular filtration rate, from external retinal photographs9; this approach offers new opportunities for noninvasive, inexpensive and scalable screening for kidney disease in low-resource settings.A deep learning analysis of blood-flow sounds detected arteriovenous fistula stenoses in patients on haemodialysis with comparable performance to an expert nephrologist performing a physical examination10; this approach has the potential for patient-facing applications.

AB Most conventional sprayers apply agrochemicals uniformly, despite the fact that distribution of weeds is typically patchy, resulting in wastage of valuable compounds, increased costs, crop damage risk, pest resistance to chemicals, environmental pollution and contamination of products. To reduce these negative impacts, a smart sprayer was designed and developed utilizing machine vision and artificial intelligence to distinguish target weeds from non-target objects (e.g. vegetable crops) and precisely spray on the desired target/location. Two different experimental scenarios were designed to simulate a vegetable field and to evaluate the smart sprayer's performance. The first scenario contained artificial weeds (targets) and artificial plants (non-targets). The second and most challenging scenario contained real plants; portulaca weeds as targets, and sedge weeds and pepper plants as non-targets. Two different embedded graphics processing unit (GPU) were evaluated as the smart sprayer processing unit (for image processing and target detection). The more powerful GPU (NVIDIA GTX 1070 Ti) achieved an overall precision of 71% and recall of 78% (for plant detection and target spraying accuracy) on the most challenging scenario with real plants, and 91% accuracy and recall for the first scenario with artificial plants. The less powerful GPU (NVIDIA Jetson TX2) achieved an overall precision and recall of 90% and 89% respectively on the first scenario with artificial plants, and 59% and 44% respectively on the second scenario with real plants. Finally, an RTK GPS was connected to the smart sprayer and an algorithm was developed to automatically generate weed maps and visualize the collected data (after every application). This smart technology integrates a state of the art (AI-based) weed detection system, a novel fast and precision spraying system, and a weed mapping system. It can significantly reduce the quantity of agrochemicals required, especially compared with traditional broadcast sprayers that usually treat the entire field, resulting in unnecessary application to areas that do not require treatment. It could also reduce costs, risk of crop damage and excess herbicide residue, as well as potentially reduce environmental impact.

AB Morphological profiling is a valuable tool in phenotypic drug discovery. The advent of high-throughput automated imaging has enabled the capturing of a wide range of morphological features of cells or organisms in response to perturbations at the single-cell resolution. Concurrently, significant advances in machine learning and deep learning, especially in computer vision, have led to substantial improvements in analyzing large-scale high-content images at high throughput. These efforts have facilitated understanding of compound mechanism of action, drug repurposing, characterization of cell morphodynamics under perturbation, and ultimately contributing to the development of novel therapeutics. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in the field of morphological profiling. We summarize the image profiling analysis workflow, survey a broad spectrum of analysis strategies encompassing feature engineering- and deep learning-based approaches, and introduce publicly available benchmark datasets. We place a particular emphasis on the application of deep learning in this pipeline, covering cell segmentation, image representation learning, and multimodal learning. Additionally, we illuminate the application of morphological profiling in phenotypic drug discovery and highlight potential challenges and opportunities in this field.

AB Specialty crop growers face challenges from numerous diseases and pests. For example, the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) is a key pest of citrus due to its role as vector of huanglongbing (HLB) (greening disease). There is no known cure for HLB, but vector management is critical, both for slowing spread and attenuating symptoms in infected trees. Therefore, monitoring ACP population, as well as other pest populations, is an essential management component for timing and assessment of control actions. Manual crop scouting is often labor intensive and time consuming. In this work, an automated system was developed and evaluated utilizing machine vision and artificial intelligence to monitor ACP in groves. This system comprised a tapping mechanism to collect insects from the tree's branches and a board with a grid of cameras for image acquisition. A software was developed using two convolutional neural-networks to accurately detect and distinguish psyllids from other insects and debris fallen from the tree. A GPS was utilized to automatically record individual tree position to facilitate data assessment on large groves. A precision and recall of 80% and 95%, respectively, was obtained on detecting ACPs on a sample of 90 young citrus trees. The system proved a great potential to automate scouting procedures in citrus and to be extended to other crop insects.

AB Motion-activated cameras ("camera traps") are increasingly used in ecological and management studies for remotely observing wildlife and are amongst the most powerful tools for wildlife research. However, studies involving camera traps result in millions of images that need to be analysed, typically by visually observing each image, in order to extract data that can be used in ecological analyses. We trained machine learning models using convolutional neural networks with the ResNet-18 architecture and 3,367,383 images to automatically classify wildlife species from camera trap images obtained from five states across the United States. We tested our model on an independent subset of images not seen during training from the United States and on an out-of-sample (or "out-of-distribution" in the machine learning literature) dataset of ungulate images from Canada. We also tested the ability of our model to distinguish empty images from those with animals in another out-of-sample dataset from Tanzania, containing a faunal community that was novel to the model. The trained model classified approximately 2,000 images per minute on a laptop computer with 16 gigabytes of RAM. The trained model achieved 98% accuracy at identifying species in the United States, the highest accuracy of such a model to date. Out-of-sample validation from Canada achieved 82% accuracy and correctly identified 94% of images containing an animal in the dataset from Tanzania. We provide an r package (Machine Learning for Wildlife Image Classification) that allows the users to (a) use the trained model presented here and (b) train their own model using classified images of wildlife from their studies. The use of machine learning to rapidly and accurately classify wildlife in camera trap images can facilitate non-invasive sampling designs in ecological studies by reducing the burden of manually analysing images. Our r package makes these methods accessible to ecologists.

AB By redefining the conventional notions of layers, we present an alternative view on finitely wide, fully trainable deep neural networks as stacked linear models in feature spaces, leading to a kernel machine interpretation. Based on this construction, we then propose a provably optimal modular learning framework for classification that does not require between-module backpropagation. This modular approach brings new insights into the label requirement of deep learning (DL). It leverages only implicit pairwise labels (weak supervision) when learning the hidden modules. When training the output module, on the other hand, it requires full supervision but achieves high label efficiency, needing as few as ten randomly selected labeled examples (one from each class) to achieve 94.88% accuracy on CIFAR-10 using a ResNet-18 backbone. Moreover, modular training enables fully modularized DL workflows, which then simplify the design and implementation of pipelines and improve the maintainability and reusability of models. To showcase the advantages of such a modularized workflow, we describe a simple yet reliable method for estimating reusability of pretrained modules as well as task transferability in a transfer learning setting. At practically no computation overhead, it precisely described the task space structure of 15 binary classification tasks from CIFAR-10.

   Vector Machine; Truck Type Classification; Weigh-In-Motion
AB The paper is concerned with the development and comparison of alternative machine learning methods of determining the type of truck crossing a bridge from the dynamic response it induces within the bridge structure, the so-called weigh-in-motion problem. Weigh-in-motion is a rich engineering problem presenting many challenges for current machine learning technologies, and for this reason is proposed as a benchmark for guiding and assessing advances in the application of this field of artificial intelligence. A review is first provided of existing methods of determining truck types and loading attributes using both machine learning and heuristic search techniques. The most promising approach to date, that of artificial neural networks, is then compared to support vector machines in a comprehensive study considering a range of configurations of both modeling techniques. A local scatter point smoothing schema is adopted as a means of selecting an optimal set of design parameters for each model type. Three main model formats are considered: (i) a monolithic model structure with a one-versus-all truck type classification strategy; (ii) an array of sub-models each dedicated to one truck type with a one-versus-all classification strategy; and (iii) an array of sub-models each dedicated to selecting between pairs of trucks in a one-versus-one classification strategy. Overall, the formats that used an array of sub-models performed best at truck classification, with the support vector machines having a slight edge over the artificial neural networks. The paper concludes with some suggestions for extending the work to a broader scope of problems.

AB Aeroelastic instability (i.e., flutter) is a critical issue that threatens the safety of flexible bridges with increasing span length. As a promising technique for flutter prevention, active aerodynamic control using auxiliary surfaces attached to the bridge deck (e.g., winglets and flaps) can be utilized to extract the stabilizing forces from the surrounding wind flow. Conventional controllers for the active aerodynamic control are usually designed using linear model-based schemes [e.g., linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and H-infinity control]. In addition to suffering from model inaccuracies, the obtained linear controller may not work well considering the high complexity of the inherently nonlinear wind-bridge-control system. To this end, this study proposes a nonlinear model-free controller based on deep reinforcement learning for active flutter control of long -span bridges. Specifically, a deep neural network (DNN), with the powerful ability to approximate nonlinear functions, is introduced to map from the system state (e.g., the motion of bridge deck) to the control command (e.g., reference position of the actively controlled surface). The DNN weights are obtained by interacting with the wind-bridge-control environment in a trial -and-error fashion (hence the explicit model of system dynamics is not required) using reinforcement learning algorithms of deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) due to its ability to tackle continuous actions with high training efficiency. As a proof of concept, numerical examples on active flutter control of a flat plate and a bridge deck are conducted to demonstrate the good performance of the proposed scheme.

AB In the semiconductor manufacturing industry, the Dynamic Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem is regarded as one of the most complex and significant scheduling problems. Existing studies consider the dynamic arrival of jobs, however, the insertion of urgent jobs such as testing chips poses a challenge to the production model, and there is an urgent need for new scheduling methods to improve the dynamic response and self-adjustment of the shop floor. In this work, deep reinforcement learning is utilized to address the dynamic flexible job shop scheduling problem and facilitate near-real-time shop floor decision-making. We extracted eight state features, including machine utilization, operation completion rate, etc., to reflect real-time shop floor production data. After examining machine availability time, the machine's earliest available time is redefined and incorporated into the design of compound scheduling rules. Eight compound scheduling rules have been developed for job selection and machine allocation. By using the state features as inputs to the Double Deep Q-Network, it is possible to acquire the state action values (Q-values) of each compound scheduling rule, and the intelligent agent can learn a reasonable optimization strategy through training. Simulation studies show that the proposed Double Deep Q-Network algorithm outperforms other heuristics and well-known scheduling rules by generating excellent solutions quickly. In most scenarios, the Double Deep Q-Network algorithm outperforms the Deep QNetwork, Q-Learning, and State-Action-Reward-State-Action (SARSA) frameworks. Moreover, the intelligent agent has good generalization ability in terms of optimization for similar objectives.

AB Precision herbicide application can substantially reduce herbicide input and weed control cost in turfgrass management systems. Intelligent spot-spraying system predominantly relies on machine vision-based detectors for autonomous weed control. In this work, several deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) were constructed for detection of dandelion (Taraxacum officinale Web.), ground ivy (Glechoma hederacea L.), and spotted spurge (Euphorbia maculata L.) growing in perennial ryegrass. When the networks were trained using a dataset containing a total of 15,486 negative (images contained perennial ryegrass with no target weeds) and 17,600 positive images (images contained target weeds), VGGNet achieved high F-1 scores (>= 0.9278), with high recall values (>= 0.9952) for detection of E. maculata, G. hederacea, and T. officinale growing in perennial ryegrass. The F-1 scores of AlexNet ranged from 0.8437 to 0.9418 and were generally lower than VGGNet at detecting E. maculata, G. hederacea, and T. officinale. GoogleNet is not an effective DCNN at detecting these weed species mainly due to the low precision values. DetectNet is an effective DCNN and achieved high F-1 scores (>= 0.9843) in the testing datasets for detection of T. officinale growing in perennial ryegrass. Moreover, VGGNet had the highest Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) values, while GoogleNet had the lowest MCC values. Overall, the approach of training DCNN, particularly VGGNet and DetectNet, presents a clear path toward developing a machine vision-based decision system in smart sprayers for precision weed control in perennial ryegrass.

However, a disadvantage with this approach is that the knowledge embedded in the neural network is opaque. In this paper, we show how to interpret neural network knowledge in symbolic form. We lay down required definitions for this treatment, formulate the interpretation algorithm, and formally verify its soundness. The main result is a formalized relationship between a neural network and a rule-based system. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the neural network generates rules of better performance than the decision tree approach in noisy conditions.

AB This paper focuses on the development, optimization, and evaluation of an intelligent real-time control system for the fabrication of precast reinforced concrete components. The study addresses the unique challenges associated with real-time control in the construction manufacturing industry, including high customization, uncertain work demand, and limited stockpiling opportunities. A production system model is built based on a real construction manufacturing factory to simulate real-world precast reinforced concrete component fabrication, and acts as the basis for the development and validation of the control system. A review of alternative decision-making techniques is presented to identify the most suitable for the control of construction manufacturing factories. Ultimately, an artificial neural network approach trained using a reinforcement learning strategy is selected as a promising technique for effective real-time control. The controller is developed and validated, and its performance is optimized using sensitivity analysis, which takes into account both the structure of the artificial neural network and the parameters of the reinforcement learning algorithm. The ANN-based control policy is applied to the sequencing of precast reinforced concrete component production, while a rule-of-thumb policy is used as a benchmark for comparison. The study demonstrates that the optimized ANN-based control policy significantly outperforms the standard rule-of-thumb policy.

AB Sleep Apnea (SA) is a prevalent sleep disorder with multifaceted etiologies that can have severe consequences for patients. Diagnosing SA traditionally relies on the in-laboratory polysomnogram (PSG), which records various human physiological activities overnight. SA diagnosis involves manual scoring by qualified physicians. Traditional machine learning methods for SA detection depend on hand-crafted features, making feature selection pivotal for downstream classification tasks. In recent years, deep learning has gained popularity in SA detection due to its capability for automatic feature extraction and superior classification accuracy. This study introduces a Deep Attention Network with Multi-Temporal Information Fusion (DAN-MTIF) for SA detection using single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. This framework utilizes three 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) blocks to extract features from R-R intervals and R-peak amplitudes using segments of varying lengths. Recognizing that features derived from different temporal scales vary in their contribution to classification, we integrate a multi-head attention module with a self-attention mechanism to learn the weights for each feature vector. Comprehensive experiments and comparisons between two paradigms of classical machine learning approaches and deep learning approaches are conducted. Our experiment results demonstrate that (1) compared with benchmark methods, the proposed DAN-MTIF exhibits excellent performance with 0.9106 accuracy, 0.9396 precision, 0.8470 sensitivity, 0.9588 specificity, and 0.8909 $F_{1}$ score at per-segment level; (2) DAN-MTIF can effectively extract features with a higher degree of discrimination from ECG segments of multiple timescales than those with a single time scale, ensuring a better SA detection performance; (3) the overall performance of deep learning methods is better than the classical machine learning algorithms, highlighting the superior performance of deep learning approaches for SA detection.

ID DISKECTOMY
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has increased in popularity in neurosurgery, with recent interest in generative AI algorithms such as the Large Language Model (LLM) ChatGPT. Sora, an innovation in generative AI, leverages natural language processing, deep learning, and computer vision to generate impressive videos from text prompts. This new tool has many potential applications in neurosurgery. These include patient education, public health, surgical training and planning, and research dissemination. However, there are considerable limitations to the current model such as physically implausible motion generation, spontaneous generation of subjects, unnatural object morphing, inaccurate physical interactions, and abnormal behavior presentation when many subjects are generated. Other typical concerns are with respect to patient privacy, bias, and ethics. Further, appropriate investigation is required to determine how effective generative videos are compared to their non-generated counterparts, irrespective of any limitations. Despite these challenges, Sora and other iterations of its text-to-video generative application may have many benefits to the neurosurgical community.

AB With Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly permeating various aspects of society, including healthcare, the adoption of the Transformers neural network architecture is rapidly changing many applications. Transformer is a type of deep learning architecture initially developed to solve general-purpose Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks and has subsequently been adapted in many fields, including healthcare. In this survey paper, we provide an overview of how this architecture has been adopted to analyze various forms of healthcare data, including clinical NLP, medical imaging, structured Electronic Health Records (EHR), social media, biophysiological signals, biomolecular sequences. Furthermore, which have also include the articles that used the transformer architecture for generating surgical instructions and predicting adverse outcomes after surgeries under the umbrella of critical care. Under diverse settings, these models have been used for clinical diagnosis, report generation, data reconstruction, and drug/protein synthesis. Finally, we also discuss the benefits and limitations of using transformers in healthcare and examine issues such as computational cost, model interpretability, fairness, alignment with human values, ethical implications, and environmental impact.

AB In this study, the previous work, present status, benefits, and limitations of the state-of-the-art technologies used in smart spraying technologies in precision weed management are reviewed. A total of 116 articles were identified from Google Scholar and Scopus to study the research work in the field of smart sprayers and precision weed management. The articles were examined based on the relevance, research focus, novelties, measured parameters, used technologies, and field of applications. Smart sprayers based on machine vision (MV) and artificial intelligence (AI) are keys to improving crop productivity and meeting the food demands of the future by reducing the yield losses due to weeds and working towards a sustainable future in agriculture. Many papers published in recent years have focused more on the machine vision, weed detection, and classification aspects of the weeding robot. Very few studies have attempted to discuss the components of a smart weeding machine, non-chemical-based weeders, the components of spraying systems, their controls, underlying fluid mechanics, and the field trials of these weeding robots. This article reviews conventional weeding techniques, machine-vision-based weeding robots, and spraying systems proposed or constructed in the last twenty-five years. Key technologies such as non-chemical-based weeding machines, image preprocessing, feature extraction, and weed detection based on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) for smart sprayers are discussed. The fundamental components of a smart spraying system are also discussed, and previous works are compared to highlight the key components, the spraying accuracy, and the major advantages and disadvantages. The fluid mechanics of the spraying system and its associated controls involved are also presented. There are still many bottlenecks in weed detection systems and smart spraying systems. The results of the systematic review provide an understanding of the progress made in the field of robotic weed detection, herbicide and non-herbicide-based weed management, the use of machine vision, and the limitations of the current spraying systems.

AB We design a deep-learning algorithm for the discovery and identification of the continuous group of symmetries present in a labeled dataset. We use fully connected neural networks to model the symmetry transformations and the corresponding generators. The constructed loss functions ensure that the applied transformations are symmetries and the corresponding set of generators forms a closed (sub)algebra. Our procedure is validated with several examples illustrating different types of conserved quantities preserved by symmetry. In the process of deriving the full set of symmetries, we analyze the complete subgroup structure of the rotation groups SO(2), SO(3), and SO(4), and of the Lorentz group SO(1, 3). Other examples include squeeze mapping, piecewise discontinuous labels, and SO(10), demonstrating that our method is completely general, with many possible applications in physics and data science. Our study also opens the door for using a machine learning approach in the mathematical study of Lie groups and their properties.

   Data sources: Fifty-eight articles from Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and PubMed databases were included.
   Conclusions: Only 15-20% of patients suffering ward arrest survive. In most cases, subtle signs of instability often occur prior to critical illness and arrest, and underlying pathology is reversible. Coarse risk assessments lead to under-triage of high-risk patients to wards, where surveillance for complications depends on time-consuming manual review of health records, infrequent patient assessments, prediction models that lack accuracy and autonomy, and biased, error-prone decision-making. Streaming electronic heath record data, wearable continuous monitors, and recent advances in deep learning and reinforcement learning can promote efficient and accurate risk assessments, earlier recognition of instability, and better decisions regarding diagnosis and treatment of reversible underlying pathology.

AB The rapid development of new technologies and the changing landscape of the online world (e.g., Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of All, cloud-based solutions) provide a unique opportunity for developing automated and robotic systems for urban farming, agriculture, and forestry. Technological advances in machine vision, global positioning systems, laser technologies, actuators, and mechatronics have enabled the development and implementation of robotic systems and intelligent technologies for precision agriculture. Herein, we present and review robotic applications on plant pathology and management, and emerging agricultural technologies for intra-urban agriculture. Greenhouse advanced management systems and technologies have been greatly developed in the last years, integrating IoT and WSN (Wireless Sensor Network). Machine learning, machine vision, and AI (Artificial Intelligence) have been utilized and applied in agriculture for automated and robotic farming. Intelligence technologies, using machine vision/learning, have been developed not only for planting, irrigation, weeding (to some extent), pruning, and harvesting, but also for plant disease detection and identification. However, plant disease detection still represents an intriguing challenge, for both abiotic and biotic stress. Many recognition methods and technologies for identifying plant disease symptoms have been successfully developed; still, the majority of them require a controlled environment for data acquisition to avoid false positives. Machine learning methods (e.g., deep and transfer learning) present promising results for improving image processing and plant symptom identification. Nevertheless, diagnostic specificity is a challenge for microorganism control and should drive the development of mechatronics and robotic solutions for disease management.

AB Data association is a key step within the multi-object tracking pipeline that is notoriously challenging due to its combinatorial nature. A popular and general way to formulate data association is as the NP-hard multidimensional assignment problem. Over the past few years, data-driven approaches to assignment have become increasingly prevalent as these techniques have started to mature. We focus this survey solely on learning algorithms for the assignment step of multi-object tracking, and we attempt to unify various methods by highlighting their connections to linear assignment and to the multi-dimensional assignment problem. First, we review probabilistic and end-to-end optimization approaches to data association, followed by methods that learn association affinities from data. We then compare the performance of the methods presented in this survey and conclude by discussing future research directions.

AB Based on deep mediatization theory and artificial intelligence (AI) technology, this study explores the effective improvement of museums' social media communication by applying Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) technology. Firstly, the social media content from four different museums is collected, a dataset containing tens of thousands of images is constructed, and a CNN-based model is designed for automatic identification and classification of image content. The model is trained and tested through a series of experiments, evaluating its performance in enhancing museums' social media communication. Experimental results indicate that the CNN model significantly enhances user participation, access rates, retention rates, and sharing rates of content. Specifically, user participation increased from 15 to 25%, reflecting a 66.7% rise. Content coverage increased from 20 to 35%, showing a 75% increase. User retention rate rose from 10 to 20%, indicating a 100% increase. Content sharing rate increased from 5 to 15%, reflecting a 200% rise. Additionally, the study discusses the model's performance across various museum types, batch sizes, and learning rate settings, verifying its robustness and wide applicability.

AB An accurate representation of hydrodynamic force and torque experienced by every particle in a distribution can be obtained from particle resolved (PR) simulations. These unique quantities are influenced by the deterministic position of surrounding particles. However, systems simulated with this methodology are typically limited to O(10,000)$$ O\left(10,000\right) $$ particles due to the involved computational cost. This resource requirement is a major bottleneck in analyzing the effect of variations in particle distribution. This article attempts to address this bottleneck by availing relatively inexpensive deep learning models. The surrogate models that we employ in this article use a physics-based hierarchical framework and symmetry-preserving neural networks to achieve robustness with limited training data. This article first performs additional generalizability tests on PR data of distinct distributions that are not involved in the training process. The models are then deployed on several different particle distributions. Impact of clustering and structure on the observed statistics are investigated.

AB This paper introduces a new deep-learning algorithm of deep belief network (DBN) based on an extreme learning machine (ELM) that is structured by back propagation (BN) and optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, named DEBP, for flood susceptibility mapping in the Vu Gia-Thu Bon watershed, central Vietnam. We use 847 locations of floods that occurred in 2007, 2009, and 2013 and 16 flood conditioning factors evaluated by an information gain ratio (IGR) technique to construct and validate the proposed model. Statistical metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F1-measure, Jaccard coefficient, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), root mean square error (RMSE), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), are used to assess the goodness-of-fit/performance and prediction accuracy of the new deep learning model. We further compare the proposed model with several well-known machine learning algorithms, including artificial neural network-based radial base function (ANNRBF), logistic regression (LR), logistic model tree (LMTree), functional tree (FTree), and alternating decision tree (ADTree). The new proposed model, DEBP, has the highest goodness-of-fit (AUC = 0.970) and prediction accuracy (AUC = 0.967) of all of the tested models and thus shows promise as a tool for flood susceptibility modeling. We conclude that novel deep learning algorithms such as the one used in this study can improve the accuracy of flood susceptibility maps that are required by planners, decision makers, and government agencies to manage of areas vulnerable to flood-induced damage.

AB Reinforcement learning (RL)-based decoders in brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) interpret dynamic neural activity without patients' real limb movements. In conventional RL, the goal state is selected by the user or defined by the physics of the problem, and the decoder finds an optimal policy essentially by assigning credit over time, which is normally very time-consuming. However, BMI tasks require finding a good policy in very few trials, which impose a limit on the complexity of the tasks that can be learned before the animal quits. Therefore, this paper explores the possibility of letting the agent infer potential goals through actions over space with multiple objects, using the instantaneous reward to assign credit spatially. A previous method, attention-gated RL employs a multilayer perceptron trained with backpropagation, but it is prone to local minima entrapment. We propose a quantized attention-gated kernel RL (QAGKRL) to avoid the local minima adaptation in spatial credit assignment and sparsify the network topology. The experimental results show that the QAGKRL achieves higher successful rates and more stable performance, indicating its powerful decoding ability for more sophisticated BMI tasks as required in clinical applications.

AB Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become the essential components for various commercialized machine learning services, such as Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS). Recent studies show that machine learning services face severe privacy threats - well-trained DNNs owned by MLaaS providers can be stolen through public APIs, namely model stealing attacks. However, most existing works undervalued the impact of such attacks, where a successful attack has to acquire confidential training data or auxiliary data regarding the victim DNN. In this paper, we propose ES Attack, a novel model stealing attack without any data hurdles. By using heuristically generated synthetic data, ES Attack iteratively trains a substitute model and eventually achieves a functionally equivalent copy of the victim DNN. The experimental results reveal the severity of ES Attack: i) ES Attack successfully steals the victim model without data hurdles, and ES Attack even outperforms most existing model stealing attacks using auxiliary data in terms of model accuracy; ii) most countermeasures are ineffective in defending ES Attack; iii) ES Attack facilitates further attacks relying on the stolen model.

AB Cell movement is known to be fundamental to many processes that take part in the overall functioning of life itself. Regeneration of damaged tissue, tumor growth or the creation of life itself through embryogenesis rely mainly on the individual and collective movement of cells. Due to the importance of such phenomena, increasing research activity has been dedicated to them, but many are the questions that still remain, specially when focusing on the movement of clusters and networks of cells as a whole. We present a new approach to take advantage of Machine Learning tools (Artificial Neural Networks) in order to predict the position and velocity of a cell in a certain moment in time, given the properties of said cell and the environment surrounding it. The results show a high level of accuracy for the analyzed video sequence, which implies that the studied properties greatly influence the decisions taken by cells regarding its movement.

We evaluate the performance of each network with three two-dimensional toy examples for a binary classification task, focusing on model complexity (measured by the number of parameters) and the size of the training dataset. Our results show that the Z(2) x Z(2) EQNN and the QNN provide superior performance for smaller parameter sets and modest training data samples.

AB This paper introduces and demonstrates a novel brain-machine interface (BMI) architecture based on the concepts of reinforcement learning (RL), coadaptation, and shaping. RL allows the BMI control algorithm to learn to complete tasks from interactions with the environment, rather than an explicit training signal. Coadaption enables continuous, synergistic adaptation between the BMI control algorithm and BMI user working in changing environments. Shaping is designed to reduce the learning curve for BMI users attempting to control a prosthetic; Here, we present the theory and in vivo experimental paradigm to illustrate how this BMI learns to complete a reaching task using a prosthetic arm in a 3-D workspace based on the user's neuronal activity. This semisupervised learning framework does not require user movements. We quantify BMI performance in closed-loop brain control over six to ten days for three rats as a function of increasing task difficulty. All three subjects coadapted with their BMI control algorithms to control the prosthetic significantly above chance at each level of difficulty.

AB Machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches have revolutionized multiple disciplines, including toxicology. This review summarizes representative recent applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches in different areas of toxicology, including physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling, quantitative structure-activity relationship modeling for toxicity prediction, adverse outcome pathway analysis, high-throughput screening, toxicogenomics, big data, and toxicological databases. By leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches, now it is possible to develop PBPK models for hundreds of chemicals efficiently, to create in silico models to predict toxicity for a large number of chemicals with similar accuracies compared with in vivo animal experiments, and to analyze a large amount of different types of data (toxicogenomics, high-content image data, etc.) to generate new insights into toxicity mechanisms rapidly, which was impossible by manual approaches in the past. To continue advancing the field of toxicological sciences, several challenges should be considered: (1) not all machine learning models are equally useful for a particular type of toxicology data, and thus it is important to test different methods to determine the optimal approach; (2) current toxicity prediction is mainly on bioactivity classification (yes/no), so additional studies are needed to predict the intensity of effect or dose-response relationship; (3) as more data become available, it is crucial to perform rigorous data quality check and develop infrastructure to store, share, analyze, evaluate, and manage big data; and (4) it is important to convert machine learning models to user-friendly interfaces to facilitate their applications by both computational and bench scientists.

AB Natural language is a key form of business communication. Textual analysis is the application of natural language processing (NLP) to textual data for automated information extraction or measurement. We survey publications in top accounting journals and describe the trend and current state of textual analysis in accounting. We organize available NLP methods in a unified framework. Accounting researchers have often used textual analysis to measure disclosure sentiment, readability, and disclosure quantity; to compare disclosures to determine similarities or differences; to identify forward-looking information; and to detect themes. For each of these tasks, we explain the conventional approach and newer approaches, which are based on machine learning, especially deep learning. We discuss how to establish the construct validity of text-based measures and the typical decisions researchers face in implementing NLP models. Finally, we discuss opportunities for future research. We conclude that (i) textual analysis has grown as an important research method and (ii) accounting researchers should increase their knowledge and use of machine learning, especially deep learning, for textual analysis.

AB Theories of decision making are implemented in models that predict and explain behavior in terms of latent cognitive processes. But where do these models come from, and how are they instantiated in the brain? In this article, we examine several avenues where artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) can benefit decision theory by providing new methods for developing and testing cognitive models. First, machine learning can be used to efficiently estimate the values of latent parameters in cognitive models and assign posterior probabilities to competing models of the same observed data. Second, models of decision behavior can be embedded within artificially intelligent systems to allow them to make inferences about human counterparts (goals, abilities, cognition) in real time, equipping AI with tools to interact socially. Third, AI can be used to understand how evolutionary and learning processes give rise to the cognitive abilities that support decision making. Last, the tools of experimental psychology and decision sciences can be applied to better understand the "black boxes" of neural networks by systematically testing input-output (stimulus-response) relationships. Put together, we suggest that merging ML/AI into decision-modeling-and vice versa-is a promising path toward many long-term benefits for both fields.

AB This review explores the comparative utility of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) in land system science (LSS) classification tasks. Through a comprehensive assessment, the study reveals that while DL techniques have emerged with transformative potential, their application in LSS often faces challenges related to data availability, computational demands, model interpretability, and overfitting. In many instances, traditional ML models currently present more effective solutions, as illustrated in our decision-making framework. Integrative opportunities for enhancing classification accuracy include data integration from diverse sources, the development of advanced DL architectures, leveraging unsupervised learning, and infusing domain-specific knowledge. The research also emphasizes the need for regular model evaluation, the creation of diversified training datasets, and fostering interdisciplinary collaborations. Furthermore, while the promise of DL for future advancements in LSS is undeniable, present considerations often tip the balance in favor of ML models for many classification schemes. This review serves as a guide for researchers, emphasizing the importance of choosing the right computational tools in the evolving landscape of LSS, to achieve reliable and nuanced land-use change data.

AB Recent advances in deep learning, including the development of AlexNet, Residual Network (ResNet), and transfer learning, offer unprecedented classification accuracy in the field of machine vision. A developing application of deep learning is the automated identification and management of aquatic invasive plants. Classification of submersed aquatic vegetation (SAV) presents a unique challenge, namely, the lack of a single source of sensor data that can produce robust, interpretable images across a variable range of depth, turbidity, and lighting conditions. This paper focuses on the development of a multi-sensor (RGB and hydroacoustic) classification system for SAV that is robust to environmental conditions and combines the strengths of each sensing modality. The detection of invasive Hydrilla verticillata (hydrilla) is the primary goal. Over 5000 aerial RGB and hydroacoustic images were generated from two Florida lakes via an unmanned aerial vehicle and boat-mounted sonar unit, and tagged for neural network training and evaluation. Classes included "HYDR", containing hydrilla; "NONE", lacking SAV, and "OTHER", containing SAV other than hydrilla. Using a transfer learning approach, deep neural networks with the ResNet architecture were individually trained on the RGB and hydroacoustic datasets. Multiple data fusion methodologies were evaluated to ensemble the outputs of these neural networks for optimal classification accuracy. A method incorporating logic and a Monte Carlo dropout approach yielded the best overall classification accuracy (84%), with recall and precision of 84.5% and 77.5%, respectively, for the hydrilla class. The training and ensembling approaches were repeated for a DenseNet model with identical training and testing datasets. The overall classification accuracy was similar between the ResNet and DenseNet models when averaged across all approaches (1.9% higher accuracy for the ResNet vs. the DenseNet).

AB This paper explores the evolution of geoscientific inquiry, tracing the progression from traditional physics-based models to modern data-driven approaches facilitated by significant advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and data collection techniques. Traditional models, which are grounded in physical and numerical frameworks, provide robust explanations by explicitly reconstructing underlying physical processes. However, their limitations in comprehensively capturing Earth's complexities and uncertainties pose challenges in optimization and real-world applicability. In contrast, contemporary data-driven models, particularly those utilizing machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), leverage extensive geoscience data to glean insights without requiring exhaustive theoretical knowledge. ML techniques have shown promise in addressing Earth science-related questions. Nevertheless, challenges such as data scarcity, computational demands, data privacy concerns, and the "black-box" nature of AI models hinder their seamless integration into geoscience. The integration of physics-based and data-driven methodologies into hybrid models presents an alternative paradigm. These models, which incorporate domain knowledge to guide AI methodologies, demonstrate enhanced efficiency and performance with reduced training data requirements. This review provides a comprehensive overview of geoscientific research paradigms, emphasizing untapped opportunities at the intersection of advanced AI techniques and geoscience. It examines major methodologies, showcases advances in large-scale models, and discusses the challenges and prospects that will shape the future landscape of AI in geoscience. The paper outlines a dynamic field ripe with possibilities, poised to unlock new understandings of Earth's complexities and further advance geoscience exploration.

AB In the face of increasing agricultural demands and environmental concerns, the effective management of weeds presents a pressing challenge in modern agriculture. Weeds not only compete with crops for resources but also pose threats to food safety and agricultural sustainability through the indiscriminate use of herbicides, which can lead to environmental contamination and herbicide-resistant weed populations. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has ushered in a paradigm shift in agriculture, particularly in the domain of weed management. AI's utilization in this domain extends beyond mere innovation, offering precise and eco-friendly solutions for the identification and control of weeds, thereby addressing critical agricultural challenges. This article aims to examine the application of AI in weed management in the context of weed detection and the increasing impact of deep learning techniques in the agricultural sector. Through an assessment of research articles, this study identifies critical factors influencing the adoption and implementation of AI in weed management. These criteria encompass factors of AI adoption (food safety, increased effectiveness, and eco-friendliness through herbicides reduction), AI implementation factors (capture technology, training datasets, AI models, and outcomes and accuracy), ancillary technologies (IoT, UAV, field robots, and herbicides), and the related impact of AI methods adoption (economic, social, technological, and environmental). Of the 5821 documents found, 99 full-text articles were assessed, and 68 were included in this study. The review highlights AI's role in enhancing food safety by reducing herbicide residues, increasing effectiveness in weed control strategies, and promoting ecofriendliness through judicious herbicide use. It underscores the importance of capture technology, training datasets, AI models, and accuracy metrics in AI implementation, emphasizing their synergy in revolutionizing weed management practices. Ancillary technologies, such as IoT, UAVs, field robots, and AI-enhanced herbicides, complement AI's capabilities, offering holistic and data-driven approaches to weed control. Additionally, the adoption of AI methods influences economic, social, technological, and environmental dimensions of agriculture. Last but not least, digital literacy emerges as a crucial enabler, empowering stakeholders to navigate AI technologies effectively and contribute to the sustainable transformation of weed management practices in agriculture.

AB This tutorial reviews a series of reinforcement learning (RL) methods implemented in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) developed to address the challenges imposed on decoder design. RL-based decoders enable the user to learn the prosthesis control through interactions without desired signals and better represent the subject's goal to complete the task. The numerous actions in complex tasks and nonstationary neural states form a vast and dynamic state-action space, imposing a computational challenge in the decoder to detect the emerging neural patterns as well as quickly establish and adjust the globally optimal policy.

AB Grapevine yellows (GY) are a significant threat to grapes due to the severe symptoms and lack of treatments. Conventional diagnosis of the phytoplasmas associated to GYs relies on symptom identification, due to sensitivity limits of diagnostic tools (e.g. real time PCR) in asymptomatic vines, where the low concentration of the pathogen or its erratic distribution can lead to a high rate of false-negatives. GY's primary symptoms are leaf discoloration and irregular wood ripening, which can be easily confused for symptoms of other diseases making recognition a difficult task. Herein, we present a novel system, utilizing convolutional neural networks, for end to-end detection of GY in red grape vine (cv. Sangiovese), using color images of leaf clippings. The diagnostic test detailed in this work does not require the user to be an expert at identifying GY. Data augmentation strategies make the system robust to alignment errors during data capture. When applied to the task of recognizing GY from digital images of leaf clippings-amongst many other diseases and a healthy control the system has a sensitivity of 98.96% and a specificity of 99.40%. Deep learning has 35.97% and 9.88% better predictive value (PPV) when recognizing GY from sight, than a baseline system without deep learning and trained humans respectively. We evaluate six neural network architectures: AlexNet, GoogLeNet, Inception v3, ResNet-50, ResNet-101 and SqueezeNet. We find ResNet-50 to be the best compromise of accuracy and training cost. The trained neural networks, code to reproduce the experiments, and data of leaf clipping images are available on the internet. This work will advance the frontier of GY detection by improving detection speed, enabling a more effective response to the disease.

AB The past 50 yr of advances in weed recognition technologies have poised site-specific weed control (SSWC) on the cusp of requisite performance for large-scale production systems. The technology offers improved management of diverse weed morphology over highly variable background environments. SSWC enables the use of nonselective weed control options, such as lasers and electrical weeding, as feasible in-crop selective alternatives to herbicides by targeting individual weeds. This review looks at the progress made over this half-century of research and its implications for future weed recognition and control efforts; summarizing advances in computer vision techniques and the most recent deep convolutional neural network (CNN) approaches to weed recognition. The first use of CNNs for plant identification in 2015 began an era of rapid improvement in algorithm performance on larger and more diverse datasets. These performance gains and subsequent research have shown that the variability of large-scale cropping systems is best managed by deep learning for in-crop weed recognition. The benefits of deep learning and improved accessibility to open-source software and hardware tools has been evident in the adoption of these tools by weed researchers and the increased popularity of CNN-based weed recognition research. The field of machine learning holds substantial promise for weed control, especially the implementation of truly integrated weed management strategies. Whereas previous approaches sought to reduce environmental variability or manage it with advanced algorithms, research in deep learning architectures suggests that large-scale, multi-modal approaches are the future for weed recognition.

AB Objective: To compare the accuracy and computational efficiency of two of the latest deep-learning algorithms for automatic identification of cephalometric landmarks.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 1028 cephalometric radiographic images were selected as learning data that trained You-Only-Look-Once version 3 (YOLOv3) and Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) methods. The number of target labeling was 80 landmarks. After the deep-learning process, the algorithms were tested using a new test data set composed of 283 images. Accuracy was determined by measuring the point-to-point error and success detection rate and was visualized by drawing scattergrams. The computational time of both algorithms was also recorded.
   Results: The YOLOv3 algorithm outperformed SSD in accuracy for 38 of 80 landmarks. The other 42 of 80 landmarks did not show a statistically significant difference between YOLOv3 and SSD. Error plots of YOLOv3 showed not only a smaller error range but also a more isotropic tendency. The mean computational time spent per image was 0.05 seconds and 2.89 seconds for YOLOv3 and SSD, respectively. YOLOv3 showed approximately 5% higher accuracy compared with the top benchmarks in the literature.
   Conclusions: Between the two latest deep-learning methods applied, YOLOv3 seemed to be more promising as a fully automated cephalometric landmark identification system for use in clinical practice.

AB Facial expressions are essential for communication and emotional expression across species. Despite the improvements brought by tools like the Horse Grimace Scale (HGS) in pain recognition in horses, their reliance on human identification of characteristic traits presents drawbacks such as subjectivity, training requirements, costs, and potential bias. Despite these challenges, the development of facial expression pain scales for animals has been making strides. To address these limitations, Automated Pain Recognition (APR) powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a promising advancement. Notably, computer vision and machine learning have revolutionized our approach to identifying and addressing pain in non-verbal patients, including animals, with profound implications for both veterinary medicine and animal welfare. By leveraging the capabilities of AI algorithms, we can construct sophisticated models capable of analyzing diverse data inputs, encompassing not only facial expressions but also body language, vocalizations, and physiological signals, to provide precise and objective evaluations of an animal's pain levels. While the advancement of APR holds great promise for improving animal welfare by enabling better pain management, it also brings forth the need to overcome data limitations, ensure ethical practices, and develop robust ground truth measures. This narrative review aimed to provide a comprehensive overview, tracing the journey from the initial application of facial expression recognition for the development of pain scales in animals to the recent application, evolution, and limitations of APR, thereby contributing to understanding this rapidly evolving field.

AB Facial expressions are essential in animal communication, and facial expression-based pain scales have been developed for different species. Automated pain recognition offers a valid alternative to manual annotation with growing evidence across species. This study applied machine learning (ML) methods, using a pre-trained VGG-16 base and a Support Vector Machine classifier to automate pain recognition in caprine patients in hospital settings, evaluating different frame extraction rates and validation techniques. The study included goats of different breed, age, sex, and varying medical conditions presented to the University of Florida's Large Animal Hospital. Painful status was determined using the UNESP-Botucatu Goat Acute Pain Scale. The final dataset comprised images from 40 goats (20 painful, 20 non-painful), with 2,253 'non-painful' and 3,154 'painful' images at 1 frame per second (FPS) extraction rate and 7,630 'non-painful' and 9,071 'painful' images at 3 FPS. Images were used to train deep learning-based models with different approaches. The model input was raw images, and pain presence was the target attribute (model output). For the single train-test split and 5-fold cross-validation, the models achieved approximately 80% accuracy, while the subject-wise 10-fold cross-validation showed mean accuracies above 60%. These findings suggest ML's potential in goat pain assessment.

AB Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models are useful tools in drug development and risk assessment of environmental chemicals. PBPK model development requires the collection of species-specific physiological, and chemical-specific absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) parameters, which can be a time-consuming and expensive process. This raises a need to create computational models capable of predicting input parameter values for PBPK models, especially for new compounds. In this review, we summarize an emerging paradigm for integrating PBPK modeling with machine learning (ML) or artificial intelligence (AI)-based computational methods. This paradigm includes 3 steps (1) obtain time-concentration PK data and/or ADME parameters from publicly available databases, (2) develop ML/AI-based approaches to predict ADME parameters, and (3) incorporate the ML/AI models into PBPK models to predict PK summary statistics (eg, area under the curve and maximum plasma concentration). We also discuss a neural network architecture "neural ordinary differential equation (Neural-ODE)" that is capable of providing better predictive capabilities than other ML methods when used to directly predict time-series PK profiles. In order to support applications of ML/AI methods for PBPK model development, several challenges should be addressed (1) as more data become available, it is important to expand the training set by including the structural diversity of compounds to improve the prediction accuracy of ML/AI models; (2) due to the black box nature of many ML models, lack of sufficient interpretability is a limitation; (3) Neural-ODE has great potential to be used to generate time-series PK profiles for new compounds with limited ADME information, but its application remains to be explored. Despite existing challenges, ML/AI approaches will continue to facilitate the efficient development of robust PBPK models for a large number of chemicals.

AB Several decades ago, Profs. Sean Meyn and Lei Guo were postdoctoral fellows at ANU, where they shared interest in recursive algorithms. It seems fitting to celebrate Lei Guo's 60th birthday with a review of the ODE Method and its recent evolution, with focus on the following themes: The method has been regarded as a technique for algorithm analysis. It is argued that this viewpoint is backwards: The original stochastic approximation method was surely motivated by an ODE, and tools for analysis came much later (based on establishing robustness of Euler approximations). The paper presents a brief survey of recent research in machine learning that shows the power of algorithm design in continuous time, following by careful approximation to obtain a practical recursive algorithm. While these methods are usually presented in a stochastic setting, this is not a prerequisite. In fact, recent theory shows that rates of convergence can be dramatically accelerated by applying techniques inspired by quasi Monte-Carlo. Subject to conditions, the optimal rate of convergence can be obtained by applying the averaging technique of Polyak and Ruppert. The conditions are not universal, but theory suggests alternatives to achieve acceleration. The theory is illustrated with applications to gradient-free optimization, and policy gradient algorithms for reinforcement learning.

AB The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been actively promoting the use of real-world data (RWD) in drug development. RWD can generate important real-world evidence reflecting the real-world clinical environment where the treatments are used. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI), especially machine- and deep-learning (ML/DL) methods, have been increasingly used across many stages of the drug development process. Advancements in AI have also provided new strategies to analyze large, multidimensional RWD. Thus, we conducted a rapid review of articles from the past 20 years, to provide an overview of the drug development studies that use both AI and RWD. We found that the most popular applications were adverse event detection, trial recruitment, and drug repurposing. Here, we also discuss current research gaps and future opportunities.

AB There is an ever-growing mismatch between the proliferation of data-intensive, power-hungry deep learning solutions in the machine learning (ML) community and the need for agile, portable solutions in resource-constrained devices, particularly for intelligence at the edge. In this paper, we present a fundamentally novel approach that leverages data-driven intelligence with biologically-inspired efficiency. The proposed Sparse Embodiment Neural-Statistical Architecture (SENSA) decomposes the learning task into two distinct phases: a training phase and a hardware embedment phase where prototypes are extracted from the trained network and used to construct fast, sparse embodiment for hardware deployment at the edge. Specifically, we propose the Sparse Pulse Automata via Reproducing Kernel (SPARK) method, which first constructs a learning machine in the form of a dynamical system using energy-efficient spike or pulse trains, commonly used in neuroscience and neuromorphic engineering, then extracts a rule-based solution in the form of automata or lookup tables for rapid deployment in edge computing platforms. We propose to use the theoretically-grounded unifying framework of the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) to provide interpretable, nonlinear, and nonparametric solutions, compared to the typical neural network approach. In kernel methods, the explicit representation of the data is of secondary nature, allowing the same algorithm to be used for different data types without altering the learning rules. To showcase SPARK's capabilities, we carried out the first proof-of-concept demonstration on the task of isolated-word automatic speech recognition (ASR) or keyword spotting, benchmarked on the TI-46 digit corpus. Together, these energy-efficient and resource-conscious techniques will bring advanced machine learning solutions closer to the edge.

AB Human activity recognition (HAR) has multifaceted applications due to its worldly usage of acquisition devices such as smartphones, video cameras, and its ability to capture human activity data. While electronic devices and their applications are steadily growing, the advances in Artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutionized the ability to extract deep hidden information for accurate detection and its interpretation. This yields a better understanding of rapidly growing acquisition devices, AI, and applications, the three pillars of HAR under one roof. There are many review articles published on the general characteristics of HAR, a few have compared all the HAR devices at the same time, and few have explored the impact of evolving AI architecture. In our proposed review, a detailed narration on the three pillars of HAR is presented covering the period from 2011 to 2021. Further, the review presents the recommendations for an improved HAR design, its reliability, and stability. Five major findings were: (1) HAR constitutes three major pillars such as devices, AI and applications; (2) HAR has dominated the healthcare industry; (3) Hybrid AI models are in their infancy stage and needs considerable work for providing the stable and reliable design. Further, these trained models need solid prediction, high accuracy, generalization, and finally, meeting the objectives of the applications without bias; (4) little work was observed in abnormality detection during actions; and (5) almost no work has been done in forecasting actions. We conclude that: (a) HAR industry will evolve in terms of the three pillars of electronic devices, applications and the type of AI. (b) AI will provide a powerful impetus to the HAR industry in future.

AB The infinite horizon optimal tracking problem is solved for a deterministic, control-affine, unknown nonlinear dynamical system. A deep neural network (DNN) is updated in real time to approximate the unknown nonlinear system dynamics. The developed framework uses a multitimescale concurrent learning-based weight update policy, with which the output layer DNN weights are updated in real time, but the internal DNN features are updated discretely and at a slower timescale (i.e., with batch-like updates). The design of the output layer weight update policy is motivated by a Lyapunov-based analysis, and the inner features are updated according to existing DNN optimization algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the developed technique and compare its performance to existing techniques.

AB Crystallographic texture is an important descriptor of material properties but requires time-intensive electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) for identifying grain orientations. While some metrics such as grain size or grain aspect ratio can distinguish textured microstructures from untextured microstructures after significant grain growth, such morphological differences are not always visually observable. This paper explores the use of deep learning to classify experimentally measured textured microstructures without knowledge of crystallographic orientation. A deep convolutional neural network is used to extract high-order morphological features from binary images to distinguish textured microstructures from untextured microstructures. The convolutional neural network results are compared with a statistical Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests with traditional morphological metrics for describing microstructures. Results show that the convolutional neural network achieves a significantly improved classification accuracy, particularly at early stages of grain growth, highlighting the capability of deep learning to identify the subtle morphological patterns resulting from texture. The results demonstrate the potential of a convolutional neural network as a tool for reliable and automated microstructure classification with minimal preprocessing.

DE Artificial intelligence; Retinopathy of prematurity
ID BURDEN
AB Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a potentially blinding disease in premature neonates that requires a skilled workforce for diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment. Artificial intelligence is a valuable tool that clinicians employ to reduce the screening burden on ophthalmologists and neonatologists and improve the detection of treatment-requiring ROP. Neural networks such as convolutional neural networks and deep learning (DL) systems are used to calculate a vascular severity score (VSS), an important component of various risk models. These DL systems have been validated in various studies, which are reviewed here. Most importantly, we discuss a promising study that validated a DL system that could predict the development of ROP despite a lack of clinical evidence of disease on the first retinal examination. Additionally, there is promise in utilizing these systems through telemedicine in more rural and resource-limited areas. This review highlights the value of these DL systems in early ROP diagnosis.

AB Traditional light water reactor simulations are usually either high fidelity, requiring hundreds of node-hours, or low fidelity, requiring only seconds to run on a common workstation. In current research, it is desirable to combine the positive aspects of both of these simulation types while minimizing their associated negative costs. Because neural networks have shown significant success when applied to other fields, they could provide a means for combining these two classes of simulation. This paper describes a methodology for designing and training neural networks to predict normalized pin powers and k(eff) within a reflective two-dimensional pressurized water reactor assembly model. The developed methodology combines computer vision approaches, modular neural network approaches, and hyperparameter optimization methods to intelligently design novel network architectures. This methodology has been used to develop a novel new architecture, LatticeNet, which is capable of predicting pin-resolved powers and k(eff) at a high level of detail. The results produced by this novel architecture show the successful prediction of the target neutronics parameters under a variety of typical neutronics conditions, and they indicate a potential path forward for neural network-based model development.

AB Road surface quality is essential for improving driving experience and reducing traffic accidents. Traditional road condition monitoring systems are limited in their temporal (speed) and spatial (coverage) responses needed for maintaining overall road quality. Several alternative systems have been proposed that utilize sensors mounted on vehicles. In particular, with the ubiquitous use of smartphones for navigation, smartphone-based road condition assessment has emerged as a promising new approach. In this paper, we propose to analyze different multiclass supervised machine learning techniques to effectively classify road surface conditions using accelerometer, gyroscope and GPS data collected from smartphones. Our work focuses on classification of three main class labels-smooth road, potholes, and deep transverse cracks. We hypothesize that using features from all three axes of the sensors provides more accurate results as compared to using features from only one axis. We also investigate the performance of deep neural networks to classify road conditions with and without explicit manual feature extraction. Our results indicate that models trained with features from all axes of the smartphone sensors outperform models that use only one axis. We also observe that the use of neural networks provides a significantly improved data classification. The machine learning approach discussed here can be implemented on a larger scale to monitor roads for defects that present a safety risk to commuters as well as to provide maintenance information to relevant authorities.

AB Advanced sensing technologies and deep learning models are needed for automatic recognition of pathogens to protect trees in orchards. This study developed a fire blight disease detection and infected area segmentation system using image processing and deep learning approaches to automate the detection process in a complex apple orchard environment for site-specific management. Two types of images were acquired: multispectral images from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using a multispectral camera and red-greenblue (RGB) images from the ground using two different cameras. Multispectral images were preprocessed and used for image feature analysis by calculating vegetation indices, including excessive blue (ExB), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), red-edge normalized difference vegetation index (RENDVI), modified ratio vegetation index (RVI), and triangular blueness index (TBI). Vegetation indices were calculated from a total of 60 multispectral images (30 heathy and 30 fire blight infected). Results showed that RVI was most sensitive to fire blight infection among the six indices. A support vector machine model was used to classify unhealthy tree canopies. A Mask Region-Convolutional Neural Network (Mask R-CNN) based deep learning model was developed from RGB infected images. A total of 880 images were used for training, and 220 images were used for validation. Another 110 images were used for testing the trained Mask R-CNN model. A precision of 92.8 % and recall of 91.2 % were obtained by detecting the infected canopies using a ResNet-101 backbone and intersection over union (IoU) threshold of 0.7. The high precision demonstrates the effectiveness of Mask R-CNN for the identification and segmentation of fire blight infection in images taken in complex orchard conditions. These results prove the potential of this non-invasive sensing method in detecting disease in commercial fruit production for site-specific infected canopies removing.

ID GRAIN-GROWTH; COMPUTER-SIMULATION; RECRYSTALLIZATION; ENERGY; 2D
AB Anisotropic Physics-Regularized Interpretable Machine Learning Microstructure Evolution (APRIMME) is a general-purpose machine learning solution for grain growth simulations. In prior work, PRIMME employed a deep neural network to predict site-specific migration as a function of its neighboring sites to model normal, isotropic, grain growth behavior. This work aims to extend this method by incorporating grain boundary misorientation-based grain growth behavior. APRIMME is trained on anisotropic simulations created using the Monte Carlo -Potts (MCP) model. The results of this work are compared statistically using grain radius, number of sides per grain, mean neighborhood misorientations, and the standard deviation of triple junction dihedral angles, and are found to match in most cases. The exceptions are small and seem to be related to two causes: (1) the deterministic model of APRIMME is learning from the stochastic simulations of MCP, which seems to accentuate triple junction behaviors; and, (2) a bias against very small grains is made evident in a quicker decrease in grains than expected at the beginning of an APRIMME simulation. APRIMME is also evaluated for its general ability to capture anisotropic grain growth behavior by first investigating different test case initial conditions, including a circle grain, three grain, and hexagonal grain microstructures.

AB This research article proposes two deep ensemble models, namely the Deep Cascaded Ensemble (DCE) and Deep Parallel Ensemble (DPE) for automatic speech emotion classification. Classification of emotions into their respective classes has so long relied on machine learning and deep learning networks. The proposed models are a blend of different machine learning and deep learning models in a cascaded/parallel architecture. The proposed models have exhibited a considerable reduction in the consumption of memory in a Google Colab environment. Furthermore, the issues of tuning numerous hyper-parameters and the huge data demand of the deep learning algorithms are overcome by the proposed deep ensemble models. The proposed DCE and DPE have yielded optimal classification accuracy with reduced consumption of memory over less data. Experimentally, the pro-posed deep cascaded ensemble has superior performance compared to the deep parallel ensemble of the same combination of deep learning and machine learning networks as well. The proposed models and the baseline models were evaluated in terms of possible performance metrics including Cohen's kappa coefficient, accuracy of classification accuracy, space and time complexity.

AB BACKGROUND Weed infestations reduce turfgrass aesthetics and uniformity. Postemergence (POST) herbicides are applied uniformly on turfgrass, hence areas without weeds are also sprayed. Deep learning, particularly the architecture of convolutional neural network (CNN), is a state-of-art approach to recognition of images and objects. In this paper, we report deep learning CNN (DL-CNN) models that are remarkably accurate at detection of broadleaf weeds in turfgrasses. RESULTS VGGNet was the best model for detection of various broadleaf weeds growing in dormant bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.)] and DetectNet was the best model for detection of cutleaf evening-primrose (Oenothera laciniata Hill) in bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum Flugge) when the learning rate policy was exponential decay. These models achieved high F-1 scores (>0.99) and overall accuracy (>0.99), with recall values of 1.00 in the testing datasets. CONCLUSION The results of the present research demonstrate the potential for detection of broadleaf weed using DL-CNN models for detection of broadleaf weeds in turfgrass systems. Further research is required to evaluate weed control in field conditions using these models for in situ video input in conjunction with a smart sprayer. (c) 2019 Society of Chemical Industry

AB This study proposes a novel framework for spatiotemporal forecasting of Ground-level Ozone Concentration (GOC) using advanced machine learning techniques, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Regularized Extreme Learning Machines (RELM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and their wavelet counterparts. Data from eight air quality stations in Tehran, Iran, were employed for training and testing. The impact of wavelet decomposition on the reliability of machine learning models was evaluated using the Data Frame Coverage Index (DFCI). Among standalone Deep Learning (DL) models, LSTM exhibited the highest reliability with the lowest average DFCI of 0.65. Wavelet-based DL models (WLSTM and WGRU) showed similar performance with average DFCIs of 0.68 and 0.69, respectively. The wavelet and non-wavelet versions of Shallow Learning (SL) models performed comparably with average DFCIs near 0.7. Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CPP) analysis revealed the advantage of DL models in incorporating wavelet-decomposed data. SL models tended to underestimate predictive uncertainty, with slight improvements via wavelet decomposition. WBiLSTM outperformed all models in terms of probabilistic reliability indices, i.e., alpha and xi with the values of 0.83 and 0.88, respectively. Overall, this study demonstrates the potential of wavelet-based DL models for accurate and reliable spatiotemporal forecasting of GOC. The proposed framework can be valuable for air quality management in regions with elevated GOC levels.

We evaluated the performance of the U-Net and DeepLabv3 deep convolutional network architectures and two traditional machine learning techniques (support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF)) applied to seventeen coastal land cover types in west Florida using UAS multispectral aerial imagery and canopy height models (CHM). Twelve combinations of spectral bands and CHMs were used. Our results using the spectral bands showed that the U-Net (83.80-85.27% overall accuracy) and the DeepLabV3 (75.20-83.50% overall accuracy) deep learning techniques outperformed the SVM (60.50-71.10% overall accuracy) and the RF (57.40-71.0%) machine learning algorithms. The addition of the CHM to the spectral bands slightly increased the overall accuracy as a whole in the deep learning models, while the addition of a CHM notably improved the SVM and RF results. Similarly, using bands outside the three spectral bands, namely, near-infrared and red edge, increased the performance of the machine learning classifiers but had minimal impact on the deep learning classification results. The difference in the overall accuracies produced by using UAS-based lidar and SfM point clouds, as supplementary geometrical information, in the classification process was minimal across all classification techniques. Our results highlight the advantage of using deep learning networks to classify high-resolution UAS images in highly diverse coastal landscapes. We also found that low-cost, three-visible-band imagery produces results comparable to multispectral imagery that do not risk a significant reduction in classification accuracy when adopting deep learning models.

   use disorders; treatment outcomes
AB Purpose of review
   To provide an accessible overview of some of the most recent trends in the application of machine learning to the field of substance use disorders and their implications for future research and practice.
   Recent findings
   Machine-learning (ML) techniques have recently been applied to substance use disorder (SUD) data for multiple predictive applications including detecting current abuse, assessing future risk and predicting treatment success. These models cover a wide range of machine-learning techniques and data types including physiological measures, longitudinal surveys, treatment outcomes, national surveys, medical records and social media.
   Summary
   The application of machine-learning models to substance use disorder data shows significant promise, with some use cases and data types showing high predictive accuracy, particularly for models of physiological and behavioral measures for predicting current substance use, portending potential clinical diagnostic applications; however, these results are uneven, with some models performing poorly or at chance, a limitation likely reflecting insufficient data and/or weak validation methods. The field will likely benefit from larger and more multimodal datasets, greater standardization of data recording and rigorous testing protocols as well as greater use of modern deep neural network models applied to multimodal unstructured datasets.

AB The past decade has seen an explosion in the amount of digital information stored in electronic health records (EHRs). While primarily designed for archiving patient information and performing administrative healthcare tasks like billing, many researchers have found secondary use of these records for various clinical informatics applications. Over the same period, the machine learning community has seen widespread advances in the field of deep learning. In this review, we survey the current research on applying deep learning to clinical tasks based on EHR data, where we find a variety of deep learning techniques and frameworks being applied to several types of clinical applications including information extraction, representation learning, outcome prediction, phenotyping, and deidentification. We identify several limitations of current research involving topics such as model interpretability, data heterogeneity, and lack of universal benchmarks. We conclude by summarizing the state of the field and identifying avenues of future deep EHR research.

AB Objectives: The purpose is to apply a previously validated deep learning algorithm to a new thyroid nodule ul-trasound image dataset and compare its performances with radiologists.Methods: Prior study presented an algorithm which is able to detect thyroid nodules and then make malignancy classifications with two ultrasound images. A multi-task deep convolutional neural network was trained from 1278 nodules and originally tested with 99 separate nodules. The results were comparable with that of radiol-ogists. The algorithm was further tested with 378 nodules imaged with ultrasound machines from different manufacturers and product types than the training cases. Four experienced radiologists were requested to evaluate the nodules for comparison with deep learning.Results: The Area Under Curve (AUC) of the deep learning algorithm and four radiologists were calculated with parametric, binormal estimation. For the deep learning algorithm, the AUC was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.64-0.75). The AUC of radiologists were 0.63 (95% CI: 0.59-0.67), 0.66 (95% CI:0.61-0.71), 0.65 (95% CI: 0.60-0.70), and 0.63 (95%CI: 0.58-0.67).Conclusion: In the new testing dataset, the deep learning algorithm achieved similar performances with all four radiologists. The relative performance difference between the algorithm and the radiologists is not significantly affected by the difference of ultrasound scanner.

AB Identifying and quantifying the number and size of stomata on leaf surfaces is useful for a wide range of plant ecophysiological studies, specifically those related to water-use efficiency of different plant species or agricultural crops. The time-consuming nature of manually counting and measuring stomata have limited the utility of manual methods for large-scale precision agriculture applications. A deep learning segmentation network was developed to automate the analysis of stomatal density and size and to distinguish between open and closed stomata using citrus trees grafted on different rootstocks as a model system. A novel method was developed utilizing the Mask-RCNN algorithm, which allows identification, quantification, and characterization of stomata from leaf epidermal peel microscopic images with an accuracy of up to 99%. Moreover, this method permits the differentiation of open and closed stomata with 98% precision and measurement of individual stomata size. In the citrus model system, significant differences in the size and density of stomata and diurnal regulation patterns were detected that were associated with the rootstock cultivar on which the trees were grafted. Nearly 9000 individual stomata were analyzed, which would have been impractical using manual methods. The novel automated method presented here is not only accurate, but also rapid and low-cost, and can be applied to a variety of crop and non-crop plant species.

AB Deep learning describes a class of machine learning algorithms that are capable of combining raw inputs into layers of intermediate features. These algorithms have recently shown impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and often ill-understood. Hence, deep learning techniques may be particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields. We examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems-patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients-and discuss whether deep learning will be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation. Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's prediction to input features, understanding how users should interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning enabling changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to transform several areas of biology and medicine.

ID PERFORMANCE; QUALITY; MODELS
AB Transformer neural networks (TNNs) have caused a paradigm shift in deep learning domains like natural language processing, gathering immense interest due to their versatility in other fields such as time series forecasting (TSF). Most current TSF applications of TNNs use only historic observations to predict future events, ignoring information available in weather forecasts to inform better predictions, and with little attention given to the interpretability of the model's use of explanatory inputs. This work explores the potential for TNNs to perform TSF across multiple environmental variables (streamflow, stage, water temperature, and salinity) in two ecologically important regions: the Peace River watershed (Florida) and the northern Gulf of Mexico (Louisiana). The TNN was tested and its prediction uncertainty quantified for each response variable from one-to fourteen-day-ahead forecasts using past observations and spatially distributed weather forecasts. A sensitivity analysis (SA) was performed on the trained TNNs' attention weights to identify the relative influence of each input variable on each response variable across prediction windows. Overall model performance ranged from good to very good (0.78 < NSE < 0.99 for all variables and forecast horizons). Through the SA, we found that the TNN was able to learn the physical patterns behind the data, adapt the use of input variables to each forecast, and increasingly use weather forecast information as prediction windows increased. The TNN's excellent performance and flexibility, along with the intuitive interpretability highlighting the logic behind the models' forecasting decision-making process, provide evidence for the applicability of this architecture to other TSF variables and locations.

AB Plant diseases often reduce crop yield and product quality; therefore, plant disease diagnosis plays a vital role in farmers' management decisions. Visual crop inspections by humans are time-consuming and challenging tasks and, practically, can only be performed in small areas at a given time, especially since many diseases have similar symptoms. An intelligent machine vision monitoring system for automatic inspection can be a great help for farmers in this regard. Although many algorithms have been introduced for plant disease diagnosis in recent years, a simple method relying on minimal information from the images is of interest for field conditions. In this study, a novel image processing algorithm and multi-class support vector machine (SVM) were used to diagnose and classify grape leaf diseases, i.e., black measles, black rot, and leaf blight. The area of disease symptoms was separated from the healthy parts of the leaf utilizing K-means clustering automatically, and then the features were extracted in three color models, namely RGB, HSV, and l*a*b. As an efficient classification method, SVM was used in this study, where principal component analysis (PCA) was performed for feature dimension reduction. Finally, the most important features were selected by the relief feature selection. Gray-level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) features resulted in an accuracy of 98.71%, while feature dimension reduction using PCA resulted in an accuracy of 98.97%. The proposed method was compared with two deep learning methods, i. e., CNN and GoogleNet, which achieved classification accuracies of 86.82% and 94.05%, respectively, while the processing time for the proposed method was significantly shorter than those of these models.

ID SURGICAL WOUND-INFECTION; RISK CALCULATOR; MODELS
AB Accurate prediction of postoperative complications can inform shared decisions regarding prognosis, preoperative risk-reduction, and postoperative resource use. We hypothesized that multi-task deep learning models would outperform conventional machine learning models in predicting postoperative complications, and that integrating high-resolution intraoperative physiological time series would result in more granular and personalized health representations that would improve prognostication compared to preoperative predictions. In a longitudinal cohort study of 56,242 patients undergoing 67,481 inpatient surgical procedures at a university medical center, we compared deep learning models with random forests and XGBoost for predicting nine common postoperative complications using preoperative, intraoperative, and perioperative patient data. Our study indicated several significant results across experimental settings that suggest the utility of deep learning for capturing more precise representations of patient health for augmented surgical decision support. Multi-task learning improved efficiency by reducing computational resources without compromising predictive performance. Integrated gradients interpretability mechanisms identified potentially modifiable risk factors for each complication. Monte Carlo dropout methods provided a quantitative measure of prediction uncertainty that has the potential to enhance clinical trust. Multi-task learning, interpretability mechanisms, and uncertainty metrics demonstrated potential to facilitate effective clinical implementation.

AB Technological advances in omics evaluation, bioinformatics, and artificial intelligence have made us rethink ways to improve patient outcomes. Collective quantification and characterization of biological data including genomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, and proteomics is now feasible at low cost with rapid turnover. Significant advances in the integration methods of these multiomics data sets by machine learning promise us a holistic view of disease pathogenesis and yield biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis. Using machine learning tools and algorithms, it is possible to integrate multiomics data with clinical information to develop predictive models that identify risk before the condition is clinically apparent, thus facilitating early interventions to improve the health trajectories of the patients. In this review, we intend to update the readers on the recent developments related to the use of artificial intelligence in integrating multiomic and clinical data sets in the field of perinatology, focusing on neonatal intensive care and the opportunities for precision medicine. We intend to briefly discuss the potential negative societal and ethical consequences of using artificial intelligence in healthcare. We are poised for a new era in medicine where computational analysis of biological and clinical data sets will make precision medicine a reality. Impact Biotechnological advances have made multiomic evaluations feasible and integration of multiomics data may provide a holistic view of disease pathophysiology. Artificial Intelligence and machine learning tools are being increasingly used in healthcare for diagnosis, prognostication, and outcome predictions. Leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning tools for integration of multiomics and clinical data will pave the way for precision medicine in perinatology.

AB This systematic review examines the empirical literature published between 2014 and 2021 that situates artificial intelligence within K-12 educational contexts. Our review synthesizes 12 articles and highlights artificial intelligence's instructional contexts and applications in K-12 learning environments. We focused our synthesis on the learning contexts and the learner-interface interactions. Our findings highlight that most of intelligent systems are being deployed in math or informal settings. Also, there are opportunities for more collaboration to facilitate teaching and learning in domain-specific areas. Additionally, researchers can explore how to implement more collaborative learning opportunities between intelligent tutors and learners. We conclude with a discussion of the reciprocal nature of this technology integration.

AB High-dimensional statistical learning (HDSL) has wide applications in data analysis, operations research, and decision making. Despite the availability of multiple theoretical frameworks, most existing HDSL schemes stipulate the following two conditions: (a) the sparsity and (b) restricted strong convexity (RSC). This paper generalizes both conditions via the use of the folded concave penalty (FCP). More specifically, we consider an M-estimation problem where (i) (conventional) sparsity is relaxed into the approximate sparsity and (ii) RSC is completely absent. We show that the FCP-based regularization leads to poly-logarithmic sample complexity; the training data size is only required to be poly-logarithmic in the problem dimensionality. This finding can facilitate the analysis of two important classes of models that are currently less understood: high-dimensional nonsmooth learning and (deep) neural networks (NNs). For both problems, we show that poly-logarithmic sample complexity can be maintained. In particular, our results indicate that the generalizability of NNs under overparameterization can be theoretically ensured with the aid of regularization.

AB Falling injuries pose serious health risks to people of all ages, and knowing the extent of exposure to irregular surfaces will increase the ability to measure fall risk. Current gait analysis methods require overly complicated instrumentation and have not been tested for external factors such as walking surfaces that are encountered in the real-world, thus the results are difficult to extrapolate to real-world situations. Artificial intelligence approaches (in particular deep learning networks of varied architectures) to analyze data collected from wearable sensors were used to identify irregular surface exposure in a real-world setting. Thirty young adults wore six Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors placed on their body (right wrist, trunks at the L5/S1 level, left and right thigh, left and right shank) while walking over eight different surfaces commonly encountered in the living community as well as occupational settings. Three variations of deep learning models were trained to solve this walking surface recognition problem: 1) convolution neural network (CNN); 2) long short term memory (LSTM) network and 3) LSTM structure with an extra global pooling layer (Global-LSTM) which learns the coordination between different data streams (e.g. different channels of the same sensor as well as different sensors). Results indicated that all three deep learning models can recognize walking surfaces with above 0.90 accuracy, with the Global-LSTM yielding the best performance at 0.92 accuracy. In terms of individual sensors, the right thigh based Global-LSTM model reported the highest accuracy (0.90 accuracy). Results from this study provide further evidence that deep learning and wearable sensors can be utilized to recognize irregular walking surfaces induced motion alteration and applied to prevent falling injuries.

AB Deep learning networks have shown great success in several computer vision applications, but its implementation in natural land cover mapping in the context of object-based image analysis (OBIA) is rarely explored area especially in terms of the impact of training sample size on the performance comparison. In this study, two representatives of deep learning networks including fully convolutional networks (FCN) and patch-based deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN), and two conventional classifiers including random forest and support vector machine were implemented within the framework of OBIA to classify seven natural land cover types. We assessed the deep learning classifiers using different training sample sizes and compared their performance with traditional classifiers. FCN was implemented using two types of training samples to investigate its ability to utilize object surrounding information.Our results indicate that DCNN may produce inferior performance compared to conventional classifiers when the training sample size is small, but it tends to show substantially higher accuracy than the conventional classifiers when the training sample size becomes large. The results also imply that FCN is more efficient in utilizing the information in the training sample than DCNN and conventional classifiers, with higher if not similar achieved accuracy regardless of sample size. DCNN and FCN tend to show similar performance for the large sample size when the training samples used for training the FCN do not contain object surrounding label information. However, with the ability of utilizing surrounding label information, FCN always achieved much higher accuracy than all the other classification methods regardless of the number of training samples.

AB Despite the importance of product repairability, current methods for assessing and grading repairability are limited, which hampers the efforts of designers, remanufacturers, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and repair shops. To improve the efficiency of assessing product repairability, this study introduces two artificial intelligence (AI) based approaches. The first approach is a supervised learning framework that utilizes object detection on product teardown images to measure repairability. Transfer learning is employed with machine learning architectures such as ConvNeXt, GoogLeNet, ResNet50, and VGG16 to evaluate repairability scores. The second approach is an unsupervised learning framework that combines feature extraction and cluster learning to identify product design features and group devices with similar designs. It utilizes an oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF feature extractor (ORB) along with k-means clustering to extract features from teardown images and categorize products with similar designs. To demonstrate the application of these assessment approaches, smartphones are used as a case study. The results highlight the potential of artificial intelligence in developing an automated system for assessing and rating product repairability.

AB Microscopic simulation-based approaches are extensively used for determining good signal timing plans on traffic intersections. Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) such as wait time, throughput, fuel consumption, emission, and delays can be derived for variable signal timing parameters, traffic flow patterns, etc. However, these techniques are computationally intensive, especially when the number of signal timing scenarios to be simulated are large. In this paper, we propose InterTwin, a Deep Neural Network architecture based on Spatial Graph Convolution and Encoder-Decoder Recurrent networks that can predict the MOEs efficiently and accurately for a wide variety of signal timing and traffic patterns. Our methods can generate probability distributions of MOEs and are not limited to mean and standard deviation. Additionally, GPU implementations using InterTwin can derive MOEs, at least four to five orders of magnitude faster than microscopic simulations on a conventional 32 core CPU machine.

AB The rapid urban expansion in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, has escalated air pollution levels and led to a significant decrease in green spaces. This study employed machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques to examine the relationship between rising concentrations of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and decreasing urban green spaces from 1990 to 2022. The ML algorithms, specifically XGB, SVM, and RF, effectively predicted high air pollution areas, while DL models Unet, Unet++, MAnet, and Linknet accurately forecasted vegetation cover trends. The findings confirm a strong negative correlation between increased air pollution and vegetation. The decline in green spaces is not only a local concern but also has broader regional implications due to the transboundary nature of air pollution. The results highlight the critical need for pollution management strategies and urban planning that prioritize green infrastructure. The study also emphasizes the value of using ML and DL techniques for accurate, data-driven environmental assessments and predictions. Future studies could incorporate high-resolution images and integrate socioeconomic data to achieve a more comprehensive perspective on the urban environmental challenges faced by rapidly developing cities like Dhaka. The use of an integrated ML and DL strategy as highlighted in this research appears to be a practical and economical method for tracking vegetation degradation and change, and in establishing the causal links to air pollution.

AB The use of Machine Learning (ML) has gained significant attention in recent years for use in the development of surrogate models capable of predicting various neutronics parameters in Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs). These approaches aim to provide fast and accurate approximations of conventional model outputs which are typically both computationally expensive and time-consuming to run. A novel supervised learning framework LatticeNet, employing Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and computer vision techniques, has been shown to be particularly useful in the prediction of assembly and pin-level parameters such as multiplication factor or pin powers. This framework was validated using deterministically-generated training data for a standard fuel assembly, representing best-case input conditions. This paper investigates the performance of LatticeNet as well as the tools developed alongside when given Monte Carlo-generated inputs and assemblies of varying pin dimensions, assessing the network's tolerance to training data uncertainty and atypical configurations.

TI On Kernel Method-Based Connectionist Models and Supervised Deep Learning
   Without Backpropagation
SO NEURAL COMPUTATION
LA English
DT Article
ID REPRESENTATIONS
AB We propose a novel family of connectionist models based on kernel machines and consider the problem of learning layer by layer a compositional hypothesis class (i.e., a feedforward, multilayer architecture) in a supervised setting. In terms of the models, we present a principled method to "kernelize" (partly or completely) any neural network (NN). With this method, we obtain a counterpart of any given NN that is powered by kernel machines instead of neurons. In terms of learning, when learning a feedforward deep architecture in a supervised setting, one needs to train all the components simultaneously using backpropagation (BP) since there are no explicit targets for the hidden layers (Rumelhart, Hinton, & Williams, 1986). We consider without loss of generality the two-layer case and present a general framework that explicitly characterizes a target for the hidden layer that is optimal for minimizing the objective function of the network. This characterization then makes possible a purely greedy training scheme that learns one layer at a time, starting from the input layer. We provide instantiations of the abstract framework under certain architectures and objective functions. Based on these instantiations, we present a layer-wise training algorithm for an l-layer feedforward network for classification, where l >= 2 can be arbitrary. This algorithm can be given an intuitive geometric interpretation that makes the learning dynamics transparent. Empirical results are provided to complement our theory. We show that the kernelized networks, trained layer-wise, compare favorably with classical kernel machines as well as other connectionist models trained by BP. We also visualize the inner workings of the greedy kernelized models to validate our claim on the transparency of the layer-wise algorithm.

ID HIERARCHICAL-MODELS; REINFORCEMENT; ATTENTION
AB Inspired by the human vision system and learning, we propose a novel cognitive architecture that understands the content of raw videos in terms of objects without using labels. The architecture achieves four objectives: (1) Decomposing raw frames in objects by exploiting foveal vision and memory. (2) Describing the world by projecting objects on an internal canvas. (3) Extracting relevant objects from the canvas by analyzing the causal relation between objects and rewards. (4) Exploiting the information of relevant objects to facilitate the reinforcement learning (RL) process. In order to speed up learning, and better identify objects that produce rewards, the architecture implements learning by causality from the perspective of Wiener and Granger using object trajectories stored in working memory and the time series of external rewards. A novel non-parametric estimator of directed information using Renyi's entropy is designed and tested. Experiments on three environments show that our architecture extracts most of relevant objects. It can be thought of as 'understanding' the world in an object-oriented way. As a consequence, our architecture outperforms state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning in terms of training speed and transfer learning. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Precision spraying of herbicides can significantly reduce herbicide use. The detection system is the critical component within smart sprayers that is used to detect target weeds and make spraying decisions. In this work, we report several deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) models that are exceptionally accurate at detecting weeds in bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L) Pers.]. VGGNet achieved high F-1 score values (> 0.95) and out-performed GoogLeNet for detection of dollar weed (Hydrocotyle spp.), old world diamond-flower (Hedyotis cormybosa L Lam.), and Florida pusley (Richardia scabra L.) in actively growing bermudagrass. A single VGGNet model reliably detected these summer annual broadleaf weeds in bermudagrass across different mowing heights and surface conditions. DetectNet was the most successful DCNN architecture for detection of annual bluegrass (Poa annua L) or Poa annua growing with various broadleaf weeds in dormant bermudagrass. DetectNet exhibited an excellent performance for detection of weeds while growing in dormant bermudagrass, with F-1 scores > 0.99. Based on the high level of performance, we conclude that DCNN-based weed recognition can be an effective decision system in the machine vision subsystem of a precision herbicide applicator for weed control in bermudagrass turfgrasses.

AB Many unstructured decision-making problems are too complex to be solved by existing analytical methods. Organizations commonly rely on human expertise to solve such problems. Human expertise is presumed to utilize specialized knowledge structures, and recent research in artificial intelligence has sought to devise machine-learning procedures that can derive knowledge structures from sets of data that represent problem-domain exemplars. Concurrently, research in statistical methods has resulted in the development of qualitative-response models that can be applied to some of the same kinds of problems addressed by machine-learning models-especially those that involve a classification decision. Using a difficult audit decision problem requiring expertise, this paper reports on a study comparing performance of two machine-learning algorithms and logistic regression, a widely-used qualitative-response method for classification analysis. A recently-developed machine-learning algorithm, NEWQ, is found to yield the best performance characteristics.

TI Identifying the group-theoretic structure of machine-learned symmetries
SO PHYSICS LETTERS B
LA English
DT Article
ID MODEL
AB Deep learning was recently successfully used in deriving symmetry transformations that preserve important physics quantities. Being completely agnostic, these techniques postpone the identification of the discovered symmetries to a later stage. In this letter we propose methods for examining and identifying the group -theoretic structure of such machine-learned symmetries. We design loss functions which probe the subalgebra structure either during the deep learning stage of symmetry discovery or in a subsequent post-processing stage. We illustrate the new methods with examples from the U(n) Lie group family, obtaining the respective subalgebra decompositions. As an application to particle physics, we demonstrate the identification of the residual symmetries after the spontaneous breaking of non-Abelian gauge symmetries like SU(3) and SU(5) which are commonly used in model building.

AB Objectives: To compare an automated cephalometric analysis based on the latest deep learning method of automatically identifying cephalometric landmarks (AI) with previously published AI according to the test style of the worldwide AI challenges at the International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging conferences held by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE ISBI).
   Materials and Methods: This latest AI was developed by using a total of 1983 cephalograms as training data. In the training procedures, a modification of a contemporary deep learning method, YOLO version 3 algorithm, was applied. Test data consisted of 200 cephalograms. To follow the same test style of the AI challenges at IEEE ISBI, a human examiner manually identified the IEEE ISBI-designated 19 cephalometric landmarks, both in training and test data sets, which were used as references for comparison. Then, the latest AI and another human examiner independently detected the same landmarks in the test data set. The test results were compared by the measures that appeared at IEEE ISBI: the success detection rate (SDR) and the success classification rates (SCR).
   Results: SDR of the latest AI in the 2-mm range was 75.5% and SCR was 81.5%. These were greater than any other previous AIs. Compared to the human examiners, AI showed a superior success classification rate in some cephalometric analysis measures.
   Conclusions: This latest AI seems to have superior performance compared to previous AI methods. It also seems to demonstrate cephalometric analysis comparable to human examiners.

AB Background: Running is a popular physical activity that benefits health; however, running surface characteristics may influence loading impact and injury risk. Machine learning algorithms could automatically identify running surface from wearable motion sensors to quantify running exposures, and perhaps loading and injury risk for a runner.
   Research question: (1) How accurately can machine learning algorithms identify surface type from three-dimensional accelerometer sensors? (2) Does the sensor count (single or two-sensor setup) affect model accuracy?
   Methods: Twenty-nine healthy adults (23.3 +/- 3.6 years, 1.8 +/- 0.1 m, and 63.6 +/- 8.5 kg) participated in this study. Participants ran on three different surfaces (concrete, synthetic, woodchip) while fit with two three-dimensional accelerometers (lower-back and right tibia). Summary features (n = 208) were extracted from the accelerometer signals. Feature-based Gradient Boosting (GB) and signal-based deep learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models were developed. Models were trained on 90% of the data and tested on the remaining 10%. The process was repeated five times, with data randomly shuffled between train-test splits, to quantify model performance variability.
   Results: All models and configurations achieved greater than 90% average accuracy. The highest performing models were the two-sensor GB and tibia-sensor CNN (average accuracy of 97.0 +/- 0.7 and 96.1 +/- 2.6%, respectively).
   Significance: Machine learning algorithms trained on running data from a single- or dual-sensor accelerometer setup can accurately distinguish between surfaces types. Automatic identification of surfaces encountered during running activities could help runners and coaches better monitor training load, improve performance, and reduce injury rates.

ID ATTACKS
AB Side Channel Analysis (SCA) presents a clear threat to privacy and security in modern computing systems. The vast majority of communications are secured through cryptographic algorithms. These algorithms are often provably-secure from a cryptographical perspective, but their implementation on real hardware introduces vulnerabilities. Adversaries can exploit these vulnerabilities to conduct SCA and recover confidential information, such as secret keys or internal states. The threat of SCA has greatly increased as machine learning, and in particular deep learning, enhanced attacks become more common. In this work, we will examine the latest state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for side channel analysis, the theory behind them, and how they are conducted. Our focus will be on profiling attacks using deep learning techniques, but we will also examine some new and emerging methodologies enhanced by deep learning techniques, such as non-profiled attacks, artificial trace generation, and others. Finally, different deep learning-enhanced SCA schemes attempted against the ANSSI SCA Database and their relative performance will be evaluated and compared. This will lead to new research directions to secure cryptographic implementations against the latest SCA attacks.

AB Machine learning algorithms are heavily relied on to understand the vast amounts of data from high-energy particle collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The data from such collision events can naturally be represented with graph structures. Therefore, deep geometric methods, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), have been leveraged for various data analysis tasks in high-energy physics. One typical task is jet tagging, where jets are viewed as point clouds with distinct features and edge connections between their constituent particles. The increasing size and complexity of the LHC particle datasets, as well as the computational models used for their analysis, have greatly motivated the development of alternative fast and efficient computational paradigms such as quantum computation. In addition, to enhance the validity and robustness of deep networks, we can leverage the fundamental symmetries present in the data through the use of invariant inputs and equivariant layers. In this paper, we provide a fair and comprehensive comparison of classical graph neural networks (GNNs) and equivariant graph neural networks (EGNNs) and their quantum counterparts: quantum graph neural networks (QGNNs) and equivariant quantum graph neural networks (EQGNN). The four architectures were benchmarked on a binary classification task to classify the parton-level particle initiating the jet. Based on their area under the curve (AUC) scores, the quantum networks were found to outperform the classical networks. However, seeing the computational advantage of quantum networks in practice may have to wait for the further development of quantum technology and its associated application programming interfaces (APIs).

ID ASYNCHRONOUS ONLINE; CLASSROOM
AB The last two decades of online learning research vastly flourished by examining discussion board text data through content analysis based on constructs like cognitive presence (CP) with the Practical Inquiry Model (PIM). The PIM sets a footprint for how cognitive development unfolds in collaborative inquiry in online learning experiences. Ironically, content analysis is a resource-intensive endeavor in terms of time and expertise, making researchers look for ways to automate text classification through ensemble machine-learning algorithms. We leveraged large language models (LLMs) through OpenAI's Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) models in the public API to automate the content analysis of students' text data based on PIM indicators and assess the reliability and efficiency of automated content analysis compared to human analysis. Using the seven steps of the Large Language Model Content Analysis (LACA) approach, we proposed an AI-adapted CP codebook leveraging prompt engineering techniques (i.e., role, chain-of-thought, one-shot, few-shot) for the automated content analysis of CP. We found that a fine-tuned model with a one-shot prompt achieved moderate interrater reliability with researchers. The models were more reliable when classifying students' discussion board text in the Integration phase of the PIM. A cost comparison showed an obvious cost advantage of LACA approaches in online learning research in terms of efficiency. Nevertheless, practitioners still need considerable data literacy skills to deploy LACA at a scale. We offer theoretical suggestions for simplifying the CP codebook and improving the IRR with LLM. Implications for practice are discussed, and future research that includes instructional advice is recommended.

AB Yield prediction has long been a valuable tool for farmers seeking to enhance crop production. Among the many ways to predict yield, the integration of machine learning (ML) techniques is becoming more common for refining prediction methodologies. This study highlights the current landscape of remote sensing and ML techniques employed in predicting tree crop yield while also identifying critical gaps and areas for further exploration. Studies with limited datasets for training often use simpler models such as linear regression, while studies with larger datasets use more complex models, including techniques such as deep learning, ensemble methods, and hyperparameter tuning; in these cases, the performance evaluation tends to be more sophisticated. Yield prediction using ML has demonstrated accuracy levels ranging from 50 % to 99 %. Studies using smaller datasets consistently demonstrate higher accuracy rates. While ML techniques can enhance yield prediction, their effectiveness depends on strategic data collection and a multi-factor and multi-method approach. Integration of various data sources, including weather, soil, and plant data, could enhance model resilience and applicability. Enhancing research in this field could be achieved through overcoming challenges in accurate data collection and fostering the development of open datasets. This comprehensive analysis lays the groundwork for future research endeavors aimed at refining and advancing the application of remote sensing and ML techniques in accurately predicting tree crop yield.

AB Developments in computational omics technologies have provided new means to access the hidden diversity of natural products, unearthing new potential for drug discovery. In parallel, artificial intelligence approaches such as machine learning have led to exciting developments in the computational drug design field, facilitating biological activity prediction and de novo drug design for molecular targets of interest. Here, we describe current and future synergies between these developments to effectively identify drug candidates from the plethora of molecules produced by nature. We also discuss how to address key challenges in realizing the potential of these synergies, such as the need for high-quality datasets to train deep learning algorithms and appropriate strategies for algorithm validation.
   Advances in computational omics technologies are enabling access to the hidden diversity of natural products, and artificial intelligence approaches are facilitating key steps in harnessing the therapeutic potential of such compounds, including biological activity prediction. This article discusses synergies between these fields to effectively identify drug candidates from the plethora of molecules produced by nature, and how to address the challenges in realizing the potential of these synergies.

AB Objective: To develop a natural language processing system that identifies relations of medications with adverse drug events from clinical narratives. This project is part of the 2018 n2c2 challenge.
   Materials and Methods: We developed a novel clinical named entity recognition method based on an recurrent convolutional neural network and compared it to a recurrent neural network implemented using the long-short term memory architecture, explored methods to integrate medical knowledge as embedding layers in neural networks, and investigated 3 machine learning models, including support vector machines, random forests and gradient boosting for relation classification. The performance of our system was evaluated using annotated data and scripts provided by the 2018 n2c2 organizers.
   Results: Our system was among the top ranked. Our best model submitted during this challenge (based on recurrent neural networks and support vector machines) achieved lenient F1 scores of 0.9287 for concept extraction (ranked third), 0.9459 for relation classification (ranked fourth), and 0.8778 for the end-to-end relation extraction (ranked second). We developed a novel named entity recognition model based on a recurrent convolutional neural network and further investigated gradient boosting for relation classification. The new methods improved the lenient F1 scores of the 3 subtasks to 0.9292, 0.9633, and 0.8880, respectively, which are comparable to the best performance reported in this challenge.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrated the feasibility of using machine learning methods to extract the relations of medications with adverse drug events from clinical narratives.

AB In this paper, we present the need for specialized artificial intelligence (AI) for counterfeit and defect detection of PCB components. Popular computer vision object detection techniques are not sufficient for such dense, low inter-class/high intra-class variation, and limited-data hardware assurance scenarios in which accuracy is paramount. Hence, we explored the limitations of existing object detection methodologies, such as region based convolutional neural networks (RCNNs) and single shot detectors (SSDs), and compared them with our proposed method, the electronic component localization and detection network (ECLAD-Net). The results indicate that, of the compared methods, ECLAD-Net demonstrated the highest performance, with a precision of 87.2% and a recall of 98.9%. Though ECLAD-Net demonstrated decent performance, there is still much progress and collaboration needed from the hardware assurance, computer vision, and deep learning communities for automated, accurate, and scalable PCB assurance.

SO JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS

ID COMPUTABLE PHENOTYPE
AB Background: Pediatric asthma is a heterogeneous disease; however, current characterizations of its subtypes are limited. Machine learning (ML) methods are well-suited for identifying subtypes. In particular, deep neural networks can learn patient representations by leveraging longitudinal information captured in electronic health records (EHRs) while considering future outcomes. However, the traditional approach for subtype analysis requires large amounts of EHR data, which may contain protected health information causing potential concerns regarding patient privacy. Federated learning is the key technology to address privacy concerns while preserving the accuracy and performance of ML algorithms. Federated learning could enable multisite development and implementation of ML algorithms to facilitate the translation of artificial intelligence into clinical practice. Objective: The aim of this study is to develop a research protocol for implementation of federated ML across a large clinical research network to identify and discover pediatric asthma subtypes and their progression over time. Methods: This mixed methods study uses data and clinicians from the OneFlorida+ clinical research network, which is a large regional network covering linked and longitudinal patient-level real-world data (RWD) of over 20 million patients from Florida, Georgia, and Alabama in the United States. To characterize the subtypes, we will use OneFlorida+ data from 2011 to 2023 and develop a research-grade pediatric asthma computable phenotype and clinical natural language processing pipeline to identify pediatric patients with asthma aged 2-18 years. We will then apply federated learning to characterize pediatric asthma subtypes and their temporal progression. Using the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services framework, we will conduct focus groups with practicing pediatric asthma clinicians within the OneFlorida+ network to investigate the clinical utility of the subtypes. With a user-centered design, we will create prototypes to visualize the subtypes in the EHR to best assist with the clinical management of children with asthma. Results: OneFlorida+ data from 2011 to 2023 have been collected for 411,628 patients aged 2-18 years along with 11,156,148 clinical notes. We expect to complete the computable phenotyping within the first year of the project, followed by subtyping during the second and third years, and then will perform the focus groups and establish the user-centered design in the fourth and fifth years of the project. Conclusions: Pediatric asthma subtypes incorporating RWD from diverse populations could improve patient outcomes by moving the field closer to precision pediatric asthma care. Our privacy-preserving federated learning methodology and qualitative implementation work will address several challenges of applying ML to large, multicenter RWD data.

AB Objective: To summarize how artificial intelligence (AI) is being applied in COVID-19 research and determine whether these AI applications integrated heterogenous data from different sources for modeling.
   Materials and Methods: We searched 2 major COVID-19 literature databases, the National Institutes of Health's LitCovid and the World Health Organization's COVID-19 database on March 9, 2021. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline, 2 reviewers independently reviewed all the articles in 2 rounds of screening.
   Results: In the 794 studies included in the final qualitative analysis, we identified 7 key COVID-19 research areas in which AI was applied, including disease forecasting, medical imaging-based diagnosis and prognosis, early detection and prognosis (non-imaging), drug repurposing and early drug discovery, social media data analysis, genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data analysis, and other COVID-19 research topics. We also found that there was a lack of heterogenous data integration in these AI applications.
   Discussion: Risk factors relevant to COVID-19 outcomes exist in heterogeneous data sources, including electronic health records, surveillance systems, sociodemographic datasets, and many more. However, most AI applications in COVID-19 research adopted a single-sourced approach that could omit important risk factors and thus lead to biased algorithms. Integrating heterogeneous data for modeling will help realize the full potential of AI algorithms, improve precision, and reduce bias.
   Conclusion: There is a lack of data integration in the AI applications in COVID-19 research and a need for a multilevel AI framework that supports the analysis of heterogeneous data from different sources.

AB Machine vision has been increasingly used to address agricultural issues. One such case is corn field harvest losses and image-based object detection approaches, namely image processing, machine learning, and deep learning were investigated to detect and count infield corn kernels, immediately after harvest for combine harvester performance evaluation. A hand-held low-cost RGB camera was used to collect images with kernels of different backgrounds, based on which a 420 images dataset (200, 40, and 180 for training, validation, and testing, respectively) was generated. Three different models for kernel detection were constructed based on image processing, machine learning, and deep learning. For the imaging processing method, the images were preprocessed (color thresholding, graying, and erosion), followed by Hough circle detection to identify kernels. For the machine learning (cascade detector) and deep learning (Mask R-CNN, EfficientDet, YOLOv5, and YOLOX), models were trained, validated, and tested. Experimental results showed the overall performance of the deep learning network YOLOv5 was superior to the other approaches, with a small model size (89.3 MB) and a high model average precision (78.3 %) for object detection. The detection accuracy, undetection rate and F1 value were 90.7 %, 9.3 %, and 91.1 %, respectively, and the average detection rate was 55 fps. This study demonstrates that the YOLOv5 model has the potential to be used as a real-time, reliable, and robust method for infield corn kernel detection.

AB This study evaluated the potential of using machine vision in combination with deep learning (DL) to identify the early blight disease in real-time for potato production systems. Four fields were selected to collect images (n = 5199) of healthy and diseased potato plants under variable lights and shadow effects. A database was constructed using DL to identify the disease infestation at different stages throughout the growing season. Three convolutional neural networks (CNNs), namely GoogleNet, VGGNet, and EfficientNet, were trained using the PyTorch framework. The disease images were classified into three classes (2-class, 4-class, and 6-class) for accurate disease identification at different growth stages. Results of 2-class CNNs for disease identification revealed the significantly better performance of EfficientNet and VGGNet when compared with the GoogleNet (FScore range: 0.84-0.98). Results of 4-Class CNNs indicated better performance of EfficientNet when compared with other CNNs (FScore range: 0.79-0.94). Results of 6-class CNNs showed similar results as 4-class, with EfficientNet performing the best. GoogleNet, VGGNet, and EfficientNet inference time values ranged from 6.8-8.3, 2.1-2.5, 5.95-6.53 frames per second, respectively, on a Dell Latitude 5580 using graphical processing unit (GPU) mode. Overall, the CNNs and DL frameworks used in this study accurately classified the early blight disease at different stages. Site-specific application of fungicides by accurately identifying the early blight infected plants has a strong potential to reduce agrochemicals use, improve the profitability of potato growers, and lower environmental risks (runoff of fungicides to water bodies).

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning have been increasingly adopted for travel demand forecasting. The AI-based travel demand forecasting models, though generate accurate predictions, may produce prediction biases and raise fairness issues. Using such biased models for decision-making may lead to transportation policies that exacerbate social inequalities. However, limited studies have been focused on addressing the fairness issues of these models. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel methodology to develop fairness-aware, highly-accurate travel demand forecasting models. Particularly, the proposed methodology can enhance the fairness of AI models for multiple protected attributes (such as race and income) simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a new fairness regularization term, which is explicitly designed to measure the correlation between prediction accuracy and multiple protected attributes, into the loss function of the travel demand forecasting model. We conduct two case studies to evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology using real-world ridesourcing-trip data in Chicago, IL and Austin, TX, respectively. Results highlight that our proposed methodology can effectively enhance fairness for multiple protected attributes while preserving prediction accuracy. Additionally, we have compared our methodology with three state-of-the-art methods that adopt the regularization term approach, and the results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms them in both preserving prediction accuracy and enhancing fairness. This study can provide transportation professionals with a new tool to achieve fair and accurate travel demand forecasting.

AB The implementation of breeding methods requires the creation of a large and genetically diverse training population. Large-scale experiments are needed for the rapid acquisition of phenotypic data to explore the correlation between genomic and phenotypic information. Traditional sensing technologies for field surveys and field phenotyping rely on manual sampling and are time consuming and labor intensive. Since availability of personnel trained for phenotyping is a major problem, small UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) equipped with various sensors can simplify the surveying procedure, decrease data collection time, and reduce cost. In this study, we evaluated the phenotypic characteristics of sweet orange trees grafted on 25 rootstock cultivars with different influences on plant growth and productivity utilizing a UAV-based high throughput phenotyping system. Data collected by UAV were compared with data collected manually according to standard horticultural procedures. The UAV-based technique was able to detect and count citrus trees with high precision (99.9%) in an orchard of 4931 trees and estimate tree canopy size with a high correlation (R = 0.84) with the manual collected data. No correlation of UAV-based data and manually collected data was observed for yield. The reason for the observed deviation is the influence of different rootstock cultivars on yield efficiency. Despite the low vigor inducing effect of some rootstocks, they are highly productive, whilst others are high in vigor but produce less fruit. Our study demonstrates the high accuracy of the UAV technique to assess tree size. When using these techniques, it is essential to recognize the limitations imposed by the biological system.

AB Neural networks have become one of the most popularly used methods in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Due to the universal approximation theorem, a neural network with one hidden layer can approximate any continuous function on compact support as long as the number of hidden units is sufficiently large. Statistically, a neural network can be classified into a nonlinear regression framework. However, if we consider it parametrically, due to the unidentifiability of the parameters, it is difficult to derive its asymptotic properties. Instead, we consider the estimation problem in a nonparametric regression framework and use the results from sieve estimation to establish the consistency, the rates of convergence and the asymptotic normality of the neural network estimators. We also illustrate the validity of the theories via simulations.

TI Deep learning-based postharvest strawberry bruise detection under UV and
   incandescent light
SO COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE

DT Article
DE Artificial intelligence; Image processing; Strawberry bruising; UV
AB Bruising is one of the major defects of strawberries. Strawberry bruised areas are often visible as flattened, sunken, and discolored. Postharvest strawberries can be bruised by compression, impact, or vibration forces during harvesting, transportation, and packinghouse operations. These bruises make strawberries more vulnerable to rot or disease, thus shortening their shelf life. Bruises can also cause consumers to abandon pur-chase decisions. Therefore, inspecting strawberry bruises is an important procedure for commercial strawberry farms to guarantee the high quality of strawberries sent to the market. A novel technique was developed in this study to detect bruises on strawberry images captured by a color camera under incandescent and ultraviolet (UV) light. Mask Region-Based Convolutional Neural Networks (Mask R-CNN), a deep learning method, was utilized for the strawberry bruise detection. Four bruise severities were classified according to the estimated bruise ratio of every single strawberry (Minor Bruise, Light Bruise, Moderate Bruise, and Severe Bruise). The results showed that Mask R-CNN could accurately detect whether a strawberry is bruised or not under both lighting conditions. However, the strawberry bruise severity classification accuracy of the proposed machine vision technique was improved significantly under UV light compared to incandescent light. For whole strawberry bruise detection under UV light, the F1 score for detecting strawberry bruises was 0.99, and the highest F1 score for whole strawberry bruise severity classification was 0.92 for Minor Bruise. This strawberry bruise detection system can assist farmers in detecting bruised strawberries on the processing line or an automated strawberry harvester, improve the quality of strawberries that are sent to the market, and avoid shortening the shelf life of fresh strawberries.

AB Modern pebble-bed reactor concepts utilizing TRISO-fueled pebbles use on-line continuous refueling, where fuel pebbles are continuously circulated through the reactor core. Presently, no method exists for the tagging, identification, and tracking of individual TRISO-fueled pebbles as they enter and exit the reactor core. This leaves room for improvement in the nuclear material accountability and nuclear safeguards of TRISO-fueled pebbles. This work presents a methodology to identify individual TRISO-fueled pebbles by exploiting the unique distribution of the TRISO-coated particles, which is imprinted during the manufacturing process, within individual TRISO-fueled pebbles. By combining X-ray imaging and deep learning, our method learns a mapping from radiographic images to a compact Euclidean space where distances provide a direct measurement of the similarity of pebble radiographs. A deep convolutional neural network is trained to optimize the image mapping and triplet loss is implemented to enforce a greater distance between mappings that identify different fuel pebbles. A dataset consisting of 1,250 radiographic Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) Transport simulations of unique TRISO-fueled pebbles is generated for training and testing the deep learning algorithm, which achieves an accuracy of 93.49% +/- 9.35% and by first transforming the dataset with Gaussian blur transformations it achieves an accuracy of 98.70% +/- 2.60%.

AB In recent years, how to use renewable energy to reduce the energy cost of internet data center (IDC) has been an urgent problem to be solved. More and more solutions are beginning to consider machine learning, but many of the existing methods need to take advantage of some future information, which is difficult to obtain in the actual operation process. In this paper, we focus on reducing the energy cost of IDC by controlling the energy flow of renewable energy without any future information. we propose an efficient energy dynamic control algorithm based on the theory of reinforcement learning, which approximates the optimal solution by learning the feedback of historical control decisions. For the purpose of avoiding overestimation, improving the convergence ability of the algorithm, we use the double Q-method to further optimize. The extensive experimental results show that our algorithm can on average save the energy cost by 18.3% and reduce the rate of grid intervention by 26.2% compared with other algorithms, and thus has good application prospects.

DE Broad learning system (BLS); channel state information (CSI);

AB Indoor positioning technology based on Wi-Fi fingerprint recognition has been widely studied owing to the pervasiveness of hardware facilities and the ease of implementation of software technology. However, the similarity-based method is not sufficiently accurate, whereas the offline training of the neural network-based method is overly time consuming. An efficient model with high positioning accuracy is therefore not yet available. We propose a stacking ensemble broad learning localization system using channel state information as a fingerprint, which is termed EnsemLoca. A bootstrapping method is used to build the training set, which enables the EnsemLoca system to build the base learner in parallel by using bagging. The broad learning system (BLS), which is a novel neural network model, as a base learner, not only has the advantage of time complexity but also offers a sparse representation in which the features are filtered. A unique base learner is constructed by randomly selecting the samples and features, and they are combined by stack generalization. The experimental results show that the EnsemLoca system achieves higher accuracy than several machine-learning algorithms in both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS environments, and is even stronger than deep neural networks characterized by accuracy. At the same time, it has the same theoretical complexity as BLS, which greatly reduces the offline training time.

AB The safety of human workers has been the main concern in human-robot close collaboration. Along with rapidly developed artificial intelligence techniques, deep learning models using two-dimensional images have become feasible solutions for human motion detection. These models serve as "sensors" in the closed-loop system that involve humans and robots. Most existing methods that detect human motion using images do not consider the uncertainty from the deep learning model itself. The mappings established by deep learning models should not be taken blindly, and thus uncertainty should be a natural part of this type of sensor. In particular, model uncertainty should be explicitly quantified and incorporated into robot motion control to guarantee safety. With this motivation, to rigorously quantify the uncertainty of these "sensors", this letter proposes a probabilistic interpretation method and automatically provides a framework to benefit from a deep model's uncertainty. Experimental data from human-robot collaboration has been collected and used to validate the proposed method. A training strategy is proposed to efficiently train surrogate models that learn to refine the prediction of the main Bayesian models. The proposed framework is also compared with Ego hands benchmark showing a 4.7% increase in mIoU.

AB Mistrust is a major barrier to implementing deep learning in healthcare settings. Entrustment could be earned by conveying model certainty, or the probability that a given model output is accurate, but the use of uncertainty estimation for deep learning entrustment is largely unexplored, and there is no consensus regarding optimal methods for quantifying uncertainty. Our purpose is to critically evaluate methods for quantifying uncertainty in deep learning for healthcare applications and propose a conceptual framework for specifying certainty of deep learning predictions. We searched Embase, MEDLINE, and PubMed databases for articles relevant to study objectives, complying with PRISMA guidelines, rated study quality using validated tools, and extracted data according to modified CHARMS criteria. Among 30 included studies, 24 described medical imaging applications. All imaging model architectures used convolutional neural networks or a variation thereof. The predominant method for quantifying uncertainty was Monte Carlo dropout, producing predictions from multiple networks for which different neurons have dropped out and measuring variance across the distribution of resulting predictions. Conformal prediction offered similar strong performance in estimating uncertainty, along with ease of interpretation and application not only to deep learning but also to other machine learning approaches. Among the six articles describing non-imaging applications, model architectures and uncertainty estimation methods were heterogeneous, but predictive performance was generally strong, and uncertainty estimation was effective in comparing modeling methods. Overall, the use of model learning curves to quantify epistemic uncertainty (attributable to model parameters) was sparse. Heterogeneity in reporting methods precluded the performance of a meta-analysis. Uncertainty estimation methods have the potential to identify rare but important misclassifications made by deep learning models and compare modeling methods, which could build patient and

AB N-7-methylguanosine (m7G), one of the mainstream post-transcriptional RNA modifications, occupies an exceedingly significant place in medical treatments. However, classic approaches for identifying m7G sites are costly both in time and equipment. Meanwhile, the existing machine learning methods extract limited hidden information from RNA sequences, thus making it difficult to improve the accuracy. Therefore, we put forward to a deep learning network, called "GenoM7GNet," for m7G site identification. This model utilizes a Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) and is pretrained on nucleotide sequences data to capture hidden patterns from RNA sequences for m7G site prediction. Moreover, through detailed comparative experiments with various deep learning models, we discovered that the one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) exhibits outstanding performance in sequence feature learning and classification. The proposed GenoM7GNet model achieved 0.953in accuracy, 0.932in sensitivity, 0.976in specificity, 0.907in Matthews Correlation Coefficient and 0.984in Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve on performance evaluation. Extensive experimental results further prove that our GenoM7GNet model markedly surpasses other state-of-the-art models in predicting m7G sites, exhibiting high computing performance.

AB As urban traffic condition is diverse and complicated, applying reinforcement learning to reduce traffic congestion becomes one of the hot and promising topics. Especially, how to coordinate the traffic light controllers of multiple intersections is a key challenge for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Most existing MARL studies are based on traditional Q-learning, but unstable environment leads to poor learning in the complicated and dynamic traffic scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent recurrent deep deterministic policy gradient (MARDDPG) algorithm based on deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm for traffic light control (TLC) in vehiclar networks. Specifically, the centralized learning in each critic network enables each agent to estimate the policies of other agents in the decision-making process and each agent can coordinate with each other, alleviating the problem of poor learning performance caused by environmental instability. The decentralized execution enables each agent to make decisions independently. We share parameters in actor networks to speed up the training process and reduce the memory footprint. The addition of LSTM is beneficial to alleviate the instability of the environment caused by partial observable state. We utilize surveillance cameras and vehicular networks to collect status information for each intersection. Unlike previous work, we have not only considered the vehicle but also considered the pedestrians waiting to pass through the intersection. Moreover, we also set different priorities for buses and ordinary vehicles. The experimental results in a vehicular network show that our method can run stably in various scenarios and coordinate multiple intersections, which significantly reduces vehicle congestion and pedestrian congestion.

AB As concerns over environmental pollution and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions intensify, sustainable strategies in supply chain transportation are critical. This paper proposes a novel approach to optimizing transportation routes and reducing carbon emissions in a green supply chain using deep reinforcement learning. The research targets a three-tier green supply chain consisting of manufacturers, third-party logistics providers (3PL), and retailers. First, a carbon reduction model for transportation is established, accounting for both product greenness and carbon emissions that influence demand. The study then introduces a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based contract model, combining cost-sharing and profit-sharing mechanisms between retailers and logistics providers to incentivize eco-friendly practices.

AB Experimental grain growth observations often deviate from grain growth simulations, revealing that the governing rules for grain boundary motion are not fully understood. A novel deep learning model was developed to capture grain growth behavior from training data without making assumptions about the underlying physics. The Physics-Regularized Interpretable Machine Learning Microstructure Evolution (PRIMME) model consists of a multi-layer neural network that predicts the likelihood of a point changing to a neighboring grain. Here, we demonstrate PRIMME's ability to replicate two-dimensional normal grain growth by training it with Monte Carlo Potts simulations. The trained PRIMME model's grain growth predictions in several test cases show good agreement with analytical models, phase-field simulations, Monte Carlo Potts simulations, and results from the literature. Additionally, PRIMME's adaptability to investigate irregular grain growth behavior is shown. Important aspects of PRIMME like interpretability, regularization, extrapolation, and overfitting are also discussed. (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The unique potential of nanomedicine to address challenging health issues is rapidly advancing the field, leading to the generation of more effective products. However, these complex systems often pose several challenges with respect to their design for specific functionality, scalable manufacturing, characterization, quality control, and clinical translation. In this regard, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches can enable faster and more accurate data assessment, identifying trends and predicting outcomes, leading to efficient nanomedicine product development. This perspective paper discusses the potential of AI and ML in nanomedicine product development with a focus on their applications in discovery, assessment, manufacturing, and clinical trials. The potential limitations of AI and ML approaches in nanomedicine product development are also covered.

AB Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) represents a new sensing paradigm that utilizes the smart mobile devices to collect and share data. Traditional MCS systems mainly leverages the people carried smartphones and other wearable devices which are constrained by the limited sensing capability and battery power. With the popularity of unmanned vehicles like unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and driverless cars, they can provide much more reliable, accurate and cost-efficient sensing services due to to their equipped more powerful sensors. In this paper, we propose a distributed control framework for energy-efficient and DIstributed VEhicle navigation with chaRging sTations, called "e-Divert". It is a distributed multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solution, which uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract useful spatial features as the input to the actor-critic network to produce a real-time action. Also, e-Divert incorporates a distributed prioritized experience replay for better exploration and exploitation, and a long short-term memory (LSTM) enabled N-step temporal sequence modeling module. The solution fully explores the spatiotemporal nature of the considered scenario for better vehicle cooperation and competition between themselves and charging stations, to maximize the energy efficiency, data collection ratio, geographic fairness, and minimize the energy consumption simultaneously. Through extensive simulations, we find an appropriate set of hyperparameters that achieve the best performance, i.e., 5 actors in Ape-X architecture, priority exponent 0.5, and LSTM sequence length 3. Finally, we compare with four baselines including one state-of-the-art approach MADDPG. Results show that our proposed e-Divert significantly improves the energy efficiency, as compared to MADDPG, by 3.62 and 2.36 times on average when varying different numbers of vehicles and charging stations, respectively.

AB Among all the learning resources within MOOCs such as video lectures and homework, the discussion forum stood out as a valuable platform for students' learning through knowledge exchange. However, peer interactions on MOOC discussion forums are scarce. The lack of interactions among MOOC learners can yield negative effects on students' learning, causing low participation and high dropout rate. This research aims to examine the extent to which the deep-learning-based natural language generation (NLG) models can offer responses similar to human-generated responses to the learners in MOOC forums. Specifically, under the framework of social support theory, this study has examined the use of state-of-the-art deep learning models recurrent neural network (RNN) and generative pretrained transformer 2 (GPT-2) to provide students with informational, emotional, and community support with NLG on discussion forums. We first trained an RNN and GPT-2 model with 13,850 entries of post-reply pairs. Quantitative evaluation on model performance was then conducted with word perplexity, readability, and coherence. The results showed that GPT-2 outperformed RNN on all measures. We then qualitatively compared the dimensions of support provided by humans and GPT-2, and the results suggested that the GPT-2 model can comparably provide emotional and community support to human learners with contextual replies. We further surveyed participants to find out if the collected data would align with our findings. The results showed GPT-2 model could provide supportive and contextual replies to a similar extent compared to humans.

AB In this paper, we present a novel and effective approach to truck and trailer classification, which integrates deep learning models and conventional image processing and computer vision techniques. The developed method groups trucks into subcategories by carefully examining the truck classes and identifying key geometric features for discriminating truck and trailer types. We also present three discriminating features that involve shape, texture, and semantic information to identify trailer types. Experimental results demonstrate that the developed hybrid approach can achieve high accuracy with limited training data, where the vanilla deep learning approaches show moderate performance due to over-fitting and poor generalization. Additionally, the models generated are human-understandable.

AB Community resilience provides a paradigm guiding communities' preparedness and mitigation efforts to counter the increasing risks of extreme events (EEs). Knowledge regarding how communities perform during and after EEs can inform proactive resilience enhancement practices. However, the EE impacts on impacted communities are influenced by multiple variables and their implicit interactions, which are difficult to be understood and modeled with conventional mathematical or statistical models. Thus, we calibrate a spatio-temporal deep learning model to capture the dynamics of impacted communities and use explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approach to interpret the influence of communities' social and physical properties on EE impacts. Specifically, we couple graph convolutional neural network (GCN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to model the mobility dynamics for 666 census tracts (i.e., communities) in 14 medium-sized US cities affected by recent hurricanes. The model takes both static variables characterizing communities' preexisting conditions and dynamic variables depicting the changing hazard exposure. The interpretation of the model predictions based on DeepLIFT shows that community resilience, inferred from the perturbation of human mobility in this research, is highly event and geography dependent. Variables including walkability, green spaces, and civil participation generally contribute to fewer mobility perturbations, i.e., resilience contributive, while automobile-oriented accessibility and social vulnerability lead to more mobility perturbations when hazard conditions are controlled. This study empirically validates the mediative role of communities' social and physical properties on EE impacts and promotes more data-driven approaches for understanding and anticipating complex, dynamic, and place-specific community resilience.

AB Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) in dermatology have demonstrated the potential to improve the accuracy of skin cancer detection. These capabilities may augment current diagnostic processes and improve the approach to the management of skin cancer. To explain this technology, we discuss fundamental terminology, potential benefits, and limitations of AI, and commercial applications relevant to dermatologists. A clear understanding of the technology may help to reduce physician concerns about AI and promote its use in the clinical setting. Ultimately, the development and validation of AI technologies, their approval by regulatory agencies, and widespread adoption by dermatologists and other clinicians may enhance patient care. Technology-augmented detection of skin cancer has the potential to improve quality of life, reduce health care costs by reducing unnecessary procedures, and promote greater access to high-quality skin assessment. Dermatologists play a critical role in the responsible development and deployment of AI capabilities applied to skin cancer.

ID MODEL
AB Infrastructure systems in the United States are aging and considerable investment is needed to renew and replace a significant proportion of the existing systems. Piping systems, which are used in many infrastructure systems such as the distribution networks for utilities - water, sewage, gas, oil, etc., are very important in this regard. Real time scheduling is an important and necessary task in the planning and execution of construction projects. This is of particular importance in the installation of pipe systems, for which it is time consuming to plan and coordinate between team members the detailed requirements and information for the generation of practical installation schedules. During the installation stage, there can be delays or interference that could lead to the failure of the initial schedule plan. Current approaches are time-consuming, not automated and do not provide real-time schedules. Thus, the process is still fragmented and essentially manual, with inefficient information flow. To effectively improve the installation schedule, current knowledge of the installation site situation is important, with this knowledge being used to generate realistic schedules. Artificial intelligence (AI) maximizes the value of data by learning from previous cases and facilitates decision-making by making the process smarter and automatic. This paper proposes a new AI framework with machine learning (ML) and heuristic optimization techniques for automating practical pipe system installation schedule generation and optimization. A BIM model is used as reference to provide pipe system component information. A hybrid knowledge-based system is developed to integrate data-driven knowledge base and site-driven knowledge base on pipe system installation. K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) ML techniques are adapted to map extracted components with the installation activities and their requirements for installation based on knowledge obtained from industry experts and piping codes. In addition, a heuristic algorithm is adopted to optimize the installation schedule. Finally, an optimal installation schedule that minimizes overlapping activities, time and cost is suggested.

AB Value functions derived from Markov decision processes arise as a central component of algorithms as well as performance metrics in many statistics and engineering applications of machine learning. Computation of the solution to the associated Bellman equations is challenging in most practical cases of interest. A popular class of approximation techniques, known as temporal difference (TD) learning algorithms, are an important subclass of general reinforcement learning methods. The algorithms introduced in this article are intended to resolve two well-known issues with TD-learning algorithms. Their slow convergence due to very high central limit theorem variance, and the fact that, for the problem of computing the relative value function, consistent algorithms exist only in special cases. First we show that the gradients of these value functions admit a representation that lends itself to algorithm design. Based on this result, a new class of differential TD-learning algorithms is introduced. For Markovian models on Euclidean space with smooth dynamics, the algorithms are shown to be consistent under general conditions. Numerical results show dramatic variance reduction in comparison to standard methods.

AB Progress in developing therapies for the maintenance of endogenous insulin secretion in, or the prevention of, type 1 diabetes has been hindered by limited animal models, the length and cost of clinical trials, difficulties in identifying individuals who will progress faster to a clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, and heterogeneous clinical responses in intervention trials. Classic placebo-controlled intervention trials often include monotherapies, broad participant populations and extended follow-up periods focused on clinical endpoints. While this approach remains the 'gold standard' of clinical research, efforts are underway to implement new approaches harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning to accelerate drug discovery and efficacy testing. Here, we review emerging approaches for repurposing agents used to treat diseases that share pathogenic pathways with type 1 diabetes and selecting synergistic combinations of drugs to maximise therapeutic efficacy. We discuss how emerging multi-omics technologies, including analysis of antigen processing and presentation to adaptive immune cells, may lead to the discovery of novel biomarkers and subsequent translation into antigen-specific immunotherapies. We also discuss the potential for using artificial intelligence to create 'digital twin' models that enable rapid in silico testing of personalised agents as well as dose determination. To conclude, we discuss some limitations of artificial intelligence and machine learning, including issues pertaining to model interpretability and bias, as well as the continued need for validation studies via confirmatory intervention trials.

AB Objectives To perform a meta-analysis of the diagnostic performance of learning (ML) algorithms (conventional and deep learning algorithms) for the classification of malignant versus benign focal liver lesions (FLLs) on US and CEUS.
   Methods Available databases were searched for relevant published studies through September 2022. Studies met eligibility criteria if they evaluate the diagnostic performance of ML for the classification of malignant and benign focal liver lesions on US and CEUS. The pooled per-lesion sensitivities and specificities for each modality with 95% confidence intervals were calculated.
   Results A total of 8 studies on US, 11 on CEUS, and 1 study evaluating both methods met the inclusion criteria with a total of 34,245 FLLs evaluated. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of ML for the malignancy classification of FLLs were 81.7% (95% CI, 77.2-85.4%) and 84.8% (95% CI, 76.0-90.8%) for US, compared to 87.1% ( 95% CI, 81.8-91.0%) and 87.0% (95% CI, 83.1-90.1%) for CEUS. In the subgroup analysis of studies that evaluated deep learning algorithms, the sensitivity and specificity of CEUS (n = 4) increased to 92.4% (95% CI, 88.5-95.0%) and 88.2% (95% CI, 81.1-92.9%).
   Conclusions The diagnostic performance of ML algorithms for the malignant classification of FLLs was high for both US and CEUS with overall similar sensitivity and specificity. The similar performance of US may be related to the higher prevalence of DL models in that group.

AB Relation extraction is a Natural Language Processing task that aims to extract relationships from textual data. It is a critical step for information extraction. Due to its wide-scale applicability, research in relation extraction has rapidly scaled to using highly advanced neural networks. Despite their computational superiority, modern relation extractors fail to handle complicated extraction scenarios. However, a comprehensive performance analysis of the state-of-the-art extractors that compile these challenges has been missing from the literature, and this paper aims to bridge this gap. The goal has been to investigate the possible data-centric characteristics that impede neural relation extraction. Based on extensive experiments conducted using 15 state-of-the-art relation extraction algorithms ranging from recurrent architectures to large language models and seven large-scale datasets, this research suggests that modern relation extractors are not robust to complex data and relation characteristics. It emphasizes pivotal issues, such as contextual ambiguity, correlating relations, long-tail data, and fine-grained relation distributions. In addition, it sets a marker for future directions to alleviate these issues, thereby proving to be a critical resource for novice and advanced researchers. Efficient handling of the challenges described can have significant implications for the field of information extraction, which is a critical part of popular systems such as search engines and chatbots.

TI Classification of Benign and Malignant Renal Tumors Based on CT Scans
   and Clinical Data Using Machine Learning Methods
SO INFORMATICS-BASEL

DE renal cancer; classification; CT scans; machine learning
ID MASS
AB Up to 20% of renal masses & LE;4 cm is found to be benign at the time of surgical excision, raising concern for overtreatment. However, the risk of malignancy is currently unable to be accurately predicted prior to surgery using imaging alone. The objective of this study is to propose a machine learning (ML) framework for pre-operative renal tumor classification using readily available clinical and CT imaging data. We tested both traditional ML methods (i.e., XGBoost, random forest (RF)) and deep learning (DL) methods (i.e., multilayer perceptron (MLP), 3D convolutional neural network (3DCNN)) to build the classification model. We discovered that the combination of clinical and radiomics features produced the best results (i.e., AUC [95% CI] of 0.719 [0.712-0.726], a precision [95% CI] of 0.976 [0.975-0.978], a recall [95% CI] of 0.683 [0.675-0.691], and a specificity [95% CI] of 0.827 [0.817-0.837]). Our analysis revealed that employing ML models with CT scans and clinical data holds promise for classifying the risk of renal malignancy. Future work should focus on externally validating the proposed model and features to better support clinical decision-making in renal cancer diagnosis.

AB Ultrasound (US) imaging is the most commonly performed cross-sectional diagnostic imaging modality in the practice of medicine. It is low-cost, non-ionizing, portable, and capable of real-time image acquisition and display. US is a rapidly evolving technology with significant challenges and opportunities. Challenges include high inter-and intra-operator variability and limited image quality control. Tremendous opportunities have arisen in the last decade as a result of exponential growth in available computational power coupled with progressive miniaturization of US devices. As US devices become smaller, enhanced computational capability can contribute significantly to decreasing variability through advanced image processing. In this paper, we review leading machine learning (ML) approaches and research directions in US, with an emphasis on recent ML advances. We also present our outlook on future opportunities for ML techniques to further improve clinical workflow and US-based disease diagnosis and characterization.

AB Deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are an emerging technology that provide an opportunity to increase agricultural efficiency through remote sensing and automatic inferencing of field conditions. This paper examined the novel use of CNNs to identify two weeds, hair fescue and sheep sorrel, in images of wild blueberry fields. Commercial herbicide sprayers provide a uniform application of agrochemicals to manage patches of these weeds. Three object-detection and three image-classification CNNs were trained to identify hair fescue and sheep sorrel using images from 58 wild blueberry fields. The CNNs were trained using 1280x720 images and were tested at four different internal resolutions. The CNNs were retrained with progressively smaller training datasets ranging from 3780 to 472 images to determine the effect of dataset size on accuracy. YOLOv3-Tiny was the best object-detection CNN, detecting at least one target weed per image with F-1-scores of 0.97 for hair fescue and 0.90 for sheep sorrel at 1280 x 736 resolution. Darknet Reference was the most accurate image-classification CNN, classifying images containing hair fescue and sheep sorrel with F-1-scores of 0.96 and 0.95, respectively at 1280 x 736. MobileNetV2 achieved comparable results at the lowest resolution, 864 x 480, with F-1-scores of 0.95 for both weeds. Training dataset size had minimal effect on accuracy for all CNNs except Darknet Reference. This technology can be used in a smart sprayer to control target specific spray applications, reducing herbicide use. Future work will involve testing the CNNs for use on a smart sprayer and the development of an application to provide growers with field-specific information. Using CNNs to improve agricultural efficiency will create major cost-savings for wild blueberry producers.

AB As datasets increase in size and complexity, biomechanists have turned to artificial intelligence (AI) to aid their analyses. This paper explores how explainable AI (XAI) can enhance the interpretability of biomechanics data derived from musculoskeletal simulations. We use machine learning to classify the simulated lateral pinch data as belonging to models with healthy or one of two types of surgically altered wrists. This simulation-based classification task is analogous to using biomechanical movement and force data to clinically diagnose a pathological state. The XAI describes which musculoskeletal features best explain the classifications and, in turn, the pathological states, at both the local (individual decision) level and global (entire algorithm) level. We demonstrate that these descriptions agree with assessments in the literature and additionally identify the blind spots that can be missed with traditional statistical techniques.

TI Reinforcement learning in surgery
SO SURGERY
LA English
DT Article
AB Patients and physicians make essential decisions regarding diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. These actions should be performed or deferred under time constraints and uncertainty regarding patients' diagnoses and predicted response to treatment. This may lead to cognitive and judgment errors. Reinforcement learning is a subfield of machine learning that identifies a sequence of actions to increase the probability of achieving a predetermined goal. Reinforcement learning has the potential to assist in surgical decision making by recommending actions at predefined intervals and its ability to utilize complex input data, including text, image, and temporal data, in the decision-making process. The algorithm mimics a human trial-and-error learning process to calculate optimum recommendation policies. The article provides insight regarding challenges in the development and application of reinforcement learning in the medical field, with an emphasis on surgical decision making. The review focuses on challenges in formulating reward function describing the ultimate goal and determination of patient states derived from electronic health records, along with the lack of resources to simulate the potential benefits of suggested actions in response to changing physiological states during and after surgery. Although clinical implementation would require secure, interoperable, livestreaming electronic health record data for use by virtual model, development and validation of personalized reinforcement learning models in surgery can contribute to improving care by helping patients and clinicians make better decisions.

AB Plant diseases pose significant economic challenges and may lead to ecological consequences. Although plant pathologists have a significant ability to diagnose plant diseases, rapid, accurate, and early diagnosis of plant diseases by intelligent systems could improve disease control and management. This study evaluates six efficient classification models (classifiers) based on deep learning to detect common tomato diseases by analyzing symptomatic patterns on leaves. Additionally, group learning techniques, including simple and weighted majority voting methods, were employed to enhance classification performance further. Six tomato leaf diseases, including Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae bacterial spot, Phytophthora infestance late blight, Cladosporium fulvum leaf mold, Septoria lycopersici Septoria leaf spot, Corynespora cassiicola target spot, and Alternaria solani early blight, as well as healthy leaves, resulting in a total of seven classes, were utilized for the classification. Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), GoogleNet, ResNet-50, AlexNet, Inception v3, and MobileNet, were utilized, achieving classification accuracies of 65.8%, 84.9%, 93.4%, 89.4%, 93.4%, and 96%, respectively. Furthermore, applying the group learning approaches significantly improved the results, with simple majority voting achieving a classification accuracy of 99.5% and weighted majority voting achieving 100%. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the proposed deep ensemble learning models in accurately identifying and classifying tomato diseases, featuring their potential for practical applications in tomato disease diagnosis and management.

ID LOCALIZATION
AB COVID-19 pneumonia started in December 2019 and caused large casualties and huge economic losses. In this study, we intended to develop a computer-aided diagnosis system based on artificial intelligence to automatically identify the COVID-19 in chest computed tomography images. We utilized transfer learning to obtain the image-level representation (ILR) based on the backbone deep convolutional neural network. Then, a novel neighboring aware representation (NAR) was proposed to exploit the neighboring relationships between the ILR vectors. To obtain the neighboring information in the feature space of the ILRs, an ILR graph was generated based on the k-nearest neighbors algorithm, in which the ILRs were linked with their k-nearest neighboring ILRs. Afterward, the NARs were computed by the fusion of the ILRs and the graph. On the basis of this representation, a novel end-to-end COVID-19 classification architecture called neighboring aware graph neural network (NAGNN) was proposed. The private and public data sets were used for evaluation in the experiments. Results revealed that our NAGNN outperformed all the 10 state-of-the-art methods in terms of generalization ability. Therefore, the proposed NAGNN is effective in detecting COVID-19, which can be used in clinical diagnosis.

AB Distributed denial of service (DDoS) is a special form of denial of service attack. In this paper, a DDoS detection model and defense system based on deep learning in Software-Defined Network (SDN) environment are introduced. The model can learn patterns from sequences of network traffic and trace network attack activities in a historical manner. By using the defense system based on the model, the DDoS attack traffic can be effectively cleaned in Software-Defined Network. The experimental results demonstrate the much better performance of our model compared with conventional machine learning ways. It also reduces the degree of dependence on environment, simplifies the real-time update of detection system, and decreases the difficulty of upgrading or changing detection strategy.

AB Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) has shown better performance than other classifiers like Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and patch-based Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN), for object-based classification using orthoimage only in previous studies; however, for further improving deep learning algorithm performance, multi-view data should be considered for training data enrichment, which has not been investigated for FCN. The present study developed a novel OBIA classification using FCN and multi-view data extracted from small Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) for mapping landcovers. Specifically, this study proposed three methods to automatically generate multi-view training samples from orthoimage training datasets to conduct multi-view object-based classification using FCN, and compared their performances with each other and also with RF, SVM, and DCNN classifiers. The first method does not consider the object surrounding information, while the other two utilized object context information. We demonstrated that all the three versions of FCN multi-view object-based classification outperformed their counterparts utilizing orthoimage data only. Furthermore, the results also showed that when multi-view training samples were prepared with consideration of object surroundings, FCN trained with these samples gave much better accuracy than FCN classification trained without context information. Similar accuracies were achieved from the two methods utilizing object surrounding information, although sample preparation was conducted using two different ways. When comparing FCN with RF, SVM, DCNN implies that FCN generally produced better accuracy than the other classifiers, regardless of using orthoimage or multi-view data.

ID NEURAL-NETWORKS
AB Analysis of brain signals is essential to the study of mental states and various neurological conditions. The two most prevalent noninvasive signals for measuring brain activities are electroencephalography (EEG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). EEG, characterized by its higher sampling frequency, captures more temporal features, while fNIRS, with a greater number of channels, provides richer spatial information. Although a few previous studies have explored the use of multimodal deep-learning models to analyze brain activity for both EEG and fNIRS, subject-independent training-testing split analysis remains underexplored. The results of the subject-independent setting directly show the model's ability on unseen subjects, which is crucial for real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce EF-Net, a new CNN-based multimodal deep-learning model. We evaluate EF-Net on an EEG-fNIRS word generation (WG) dataset on the mental state recognition task, primarily focusing on the subject-independent setting. For completeness, we report results in the subject-dependent and subject-semidependent settings as well. We compare our model with five baseline approaches, including three traditional machine learning methods and two deep learning methods. EF-Net demonstrates superior performance in both accuracy and F1 score, surpassing these baselines. Our model achieves F1 scores of 99.36%, 98.31%, and 65.05% in the subject-dependent, subject-semidependent, and subject-independent settings, respectively, surpassing the best baseline F1 scores by 1.83%, 4.34%, and 2.13% These results highlight EF-Net's capability to effectively learn and interpret mental states and brain activity across different and unseen subjects.

AB This article presents a comprehensive approach to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image retrieval for navigation in global positioning system (GPS)-denied areas. It explores the utilization of SAR images to develop navigation techniques, assuming the system can generate real-time SAR images. The navigation process involves image retrieval, where a query image is compared to stored images in a database to identify the most similar ones. The selected images serve as reference points for extracting precise location coordinates. We propose model leveraging on the notion of Siamese artificial neural networks (ANNs), inspired by the SqueezeNet architecture, that incorporates swish activation functions and a retrieval module to address challenges related to variations in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) height and rotations. Extensive evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method, with low retrieval error and feasibility for computationally constrained devices. The stability of the method is also validated using out-of-sample data. Overall, this work contributes to the advancement of SAR image retrieval and navigation in GPS-denied environments, with potential applications in navigation, target detection, terrain classification, and more.

ID VISUAL NAVIGATION; VISION; SYSTEM; FUTURE
AB Drones can be used for tasks such as data collection and logistics in civil engineering. Current research on autonomous drones mainly focuses on planning a safe path and avoiding obstacles in a static environment. However, navigating a drone in complex environments like urban areas involves many dynamic constraints, such as building layout, winds, and signal coverage, which are interdependent. The wind factor is the most important among these environmental factors, which may cause a drone to lose control or even crash. This paper presents a multi -objective navigation reinforcement learning algorithm (MONRL) for the drone to navigate and avoid obstacles in an unknown environment when dynamic wind zones present, with only imagery data about the building layouts. Based on a deep reinforcement learning and memory architecture, the drone develops policies to prioritize navigation decisions, optimizing the path while minimizing negative impact of winds with only sparse sensor data, in our case, camera inputs. By leveraging the advantages of the proposed method in estimating the environmental factors from previous trials, no aerodynamic force sensors are needed for the drone to develop effective strategies to navigate to target while counteracting to milder winds and dodging aways from stronger winds. The proposed method was tested in a virtual environment, and a real model of New York City. The method is expected to contribute to new automation algorithms for urban aerial logistics and future automated civil infrastructure inspection.

However, EV heterogeneity makes molecular targeting precision a critical challenge. Deciphering key molecular drivers for controlling EV tissue targeting specificity is in great need. Artificial intelligence (AI) brings powerful prediction ability for guiding the rational design of engineered EVs in precision control for drug delivery. This review focuses on cutting-edge nano-delivery via integrating large-scale EV data with AI to develop AI-directed EV therapies and illuminate the clinical translation potential. We briefly review the current status of EVs in drug delivery, including the current frontier, limitations, and considerations to advance the field. Subsequently, we detail the future of AI in drug delivery and its impact on precision EV delivery. Our review discusses the current universal challenge of standardization and critical considerations when using AI combined with EVs for precision drug delivery. Finally, we will conclude this review with a perspective on future clinical translation led by a combined effort of AI and EV research.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Delivering the appropriate amount of chemicals for each plant based on their needs is essential for reducing costs, waste, and labor. Smart agricultural machinery can provide variable-rate technologies using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine vision to optimize spraying applications. In this research, a low-cost smart sensing system for controlling airblast tree crop sprayers was designed and evaluated using citrus as a case study. The prototype comprised a LiDAR, machine vision, GPS, flow meters, sensor fusion, and AI to scan trees for tree height, tree classification, and fruit counting. Specifically, this smart sensing system can detect and classify objects to tree or non-tree (e.g., human, field constructions), measure tree height and canopy density, and detect and count fruit. Based on this information, it controls spraying nozzles to optimize spraying applications. A novel software was written in C++ and ran on an Nvidia Jetson Xavier NX embedded computer to process and control the data utilizing data fusion and AI techniques. The smart sensing system's results for tree height estimate indicated a relatively low average error of 6%. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to perform tree classification with an average accuracy of 84% in classifying the collected imagery into mature, young, dead, and non-tree objects. The fruit count module (also a CNN) had an F1 score of 89%, compared to ground-truth labeled images of mature and immature citrus fruits. Finally, the adoption of this new sensing method reduced spraying volume by 28%, compared to traditional spraying applications.

AB Background Transforming large amounts of genomic data into valuable knowledge for predicting complex traits has been an important challenge for animal and plant breeders. Prediction of complex traits has not escaped the current excitement on machine-learning, including interest in deep learning algorithms such as multilayer perceptrons (MLP) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). The aim of this study was to compare the predictive performance of two deep learning methods (MLP and CNN), two ensemble learning methods [random forests (RF) and gradient boosting (GB)], and two parametric methods [genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) and Bayes B] using real and simulated datasets. Methods The real dataset consisted of 11,790 Holstein bulls with sire conception rate (SCR) records and genotyped for 58k single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). To support the evaluation of deep learning methods, various simulation studies were conducted using the observed genotype data as template, assuming a heritability of 0.30 with either additive or non-additive gene effects, and two different numbers of quantitative trait nucleotides (100 and 1000). Results In the bull dataset, the best predictive correlation was obtained with GB (0.36), followed by Bayes B (0.34), GBLUP (0.33), RF (0.32), CNN (0.29) and MLP (0.26). The same trend was observed when using mean squared error of prediction. The simulation indicated that when gene action was purely additive, parametric methods outperformed other methods. When the gene action was a combination of additive, dominance and of two-locus epistasis, the best predictive ability was obtained with gradient boosting, and the superiority of deep learning over the parametric methods depended on the number of loci controlling the trait and on sample size. In fact, with a large dataset including 80k individuals, the predictive performance of deep learning methods was similar or slightly better than that of parametric methods for traits with non-additive gene action. Conclusions For prediction of traits with non-additive gene action, gradient boosting was a robust method. Deep learning approaches were not better for genomic prediction unless non-additive variance was sizable.

AB Subjective value has long been measured using binary choice experiments, yet responses like willingness-to-pay prices can be an effective and efficient way to assess individual differences risk preferences and value. Tony Marley's work illustrated that dynamic, stochastic models permit meaningful inferences about cognition from process-level data on paradigms beyond binary choice, yet many of these models remain difficult to use because their likelihoods must be approximated from simulation. In this paper, we develop and test an approach that uses deep neural networks to estimate the parameters of otherwise-intractable behavioral models. Once trained, these networks allow for accurate and instantaneous parameter estimation. We compare different network architectures and show that they accurately recover true risk preferences related to utility, response caution, anchoring, and non-decision processes. To illustrate the usefulness of the approach, it was then applied to estimate model parameters for a large, demographically representative sample of U.S. participants who completed a 20-question pricing task - an estimation task that is not feasible with previous methods. The results illustrate the utility of machine-learning approaches for fitting cognitive and economic models, providing efficient methods for quantifying meaningful differences in risk preferences from sparse data.

TI Federated learning for preserving data privacy in collaborative
   healthcare research
SO DIGITAL HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Federated learning; deep learning; data; security; privacy
AB Generalizability, external validity, and reproducibility are high priorities for artificial intelligence applications in healthcare. Traditional approaches to addressing these elements involve sharing patient data between institutions or practice settings, which can compromise data privacy (individuals' right to prevent the sharing and disclosure of information about themselves) and data security (simultaneously preserving confidentiality, accuracy, fidelity, and availability of data). This article describes insights from real-world implementation of federated learning techniques that offer opportunities to maintain both data privacy and availability via collaborative machine learning that shares knowledge, not data. Local models are trained separately on local data. As they train, they send local model updates (e.g. coefficients or gradients) for consolidation into a global model. In some use cases, global models outperform local models on new, previously unseen local datasets, suggesting that collaborative learning from a greater number of examples, including a greater number of rare cases, may improve predictive performance. Even when sharing model updates rather than data, privacy leakage can occur when adversaries perform property or membership inference attacks which can be used to ascertain information about the training set. Emerging techniques mitigate risk from adversarial attacks, allowing investigators to maintain both data privacy and availability in collaborative healthcare research. When data heterogeneity between participating centers is high, personalized algorithms may offer greater generalizability by improving performance on data from centers with proportionately smaller training sample sizes. Properly applied, federated learning has the potential to optimize the reproducibility and performance of collaborative learning while preserving data security and privacy.

AB In strawberry cultivation, precise disease management is crucial for maximizing yields and reducing unnecessary fungicide use. Traditional methods for measuring leaf wetness duration (LWD), a critical factor in assessing the risk of fungal diseases such as botrytis fruit rot and anthracnose, have been reliant on sensors with known limitations in accuracy and reliability and difficulties with calibrating. To overcome these limitations, this study introduced an innovative algorithm for leaf wetness detection systems employing high-resolution imaging and deep learning technologies, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Implemented at the University of Florida's Plant Science Research and Education Unit (PSREU) in Citra, FL, USA, and expanded to three additional locations across Florida, USA, the system captured and analyzed images of a reference plate to accurately determine the wetness and, consequently, the LWD. The comparison of system outputs with manual observations across diverse environmental conditions demonstrated the enhanced accuracy and reliability of the artificial intelligence-driven approach. By integrating this system into the Strawberry Advisory System (SAS), this study provided an efficient solution to improve disease risk assessment and fungicide application strategies, promising significant economic benefits and sustainability advances in strawberry production.

AB Retrieving queried information from building information models (BIM) requires experience in structured query languages and manipulation of BIM software. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based spoken dialogue systems provide more opportunities for information retrieval from building information models via natural language queries. This research developed a transfer learning-based text classification (TC) method to classify different queries into predefined categories for an intelligent building information spoken dialogue system (iBISDS), a virtual assistant that provides information retrieval support for construction project team members. The architecture of the TC neural network (NN) was built based on the pre-trained Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa). After the training process, the re-trained and fine-tuned RoBERTa NN achieved a precision of 99.76%, a recall of 99.76%, and an F1 score of 99.76% on the testing dataset. The experimental results indicated that the developed NN algorithm for TC can relatively accurately classify different building information-related queries into pre-defined TC categories.

Despite notable progress, numerous challenges remain, necessitating the refinement of deep learning algorithms for optimal performance in medical image analysis. This paper explores the growing demand for precise and robust medical image analysis by focusing on an advanced deep learning technique, multistage transfer learning. Over the past decade, multistage transfer learning has emerged as a pivotal strategy, particularly in overcoming challenges associated with limited medical data and model generalization. However, the absence of well-compiled literature capturing this development remains a notable gap in the field. This exhaustive investigation endeavors to address this gap by providing a foundational understanding of how multistage transfer learning approaches confront the unique challenges posed by insufficient medical image datasets. The paper offers a detailed analysis of various multistage transfer learning types, architectures, methodologies, and strategies deployed in medical image analysis. Additionally, it delves into intrinsic challenges within this framework, providing a comprehensive overview of the current state while outlining potential directions for advancing methodologies in future research. This paper underscores the transformative potential of multistage transfer learning in medical image analysis, providing valuable guidance to researchers and healthcare professionals.

TI Analysis of the LatticeNet neural network framework's performance using

AB Various Machine Learning (ML) techniques have seen recent and growing interest in the creation of surrogate neutronics models as a potential way to avoid the computational expenses associated with conventional high-fidelity modeling. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have been shown to be particularly useful for single-assembly predictions involving pin-wise power distributions and multiplication factors. In this paper, the LatticeNet neural network framework is investigated as a method to predict Doppler and moderator temperature coefficients for Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) fuel assemblies, as well as differential boron worth. This approach uses the built-in tools developed alongside LatticeNet to construct two fully-connected network architectures capable of predicting k-eigenvalues from two inputs such as fuel enrichment and temperature when trained with data generated with CASMO-4E. A single network taking in all study parameters as inputs was then used to predict k-eigenvalues for fuel temperature, moderator temperature, and boron perturbation cases. The calculated temperature coefficients and differential boron worth values were compared with a bank of reference values to validate the efficacy of this method. Overall, differences in k-eigenvalues were within 0.017% in the worst case. The temperature coefficients saw mean errors of 1.85% and 1.69% for the twoparameter networks, respectively. The all-parameter network was then shown to predict 1100 points in 236 ms compared to the 4.95 min CASMO-4E took to generate them. Additionally, the differential boron worth achieved the lowest mean error of 0.30%; each of these values were within our acceptance criteria.

AB The Strawberry Advisory System (SAS) is a tool developed to help Florida strawberry growers determine the risk of common fungal diseases and the need for fungicide applications. Leaf wetness duration (LWD) is one of the important parameters in SAS disease risk modeling. By accurately measuring the LWD, disease risk can be better assessed, leading to less fungicide use and more economic benefits to the farmers. This research aimed to develop and test a more accurate leaf wetness detection system than traditional leaf wetness sensors. In this research, a leaf wetness detection system was developed and tested using color imaging of a reference surface and a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is one of the artificial-intelligence-based learning methods. The system was placed at two separate field locations during the 2021-2022 strawberry-growing season. The results from the developed system were compared against manual observation to determine the accuracy of the system. It was found that the AI- and imaging-based system had high accuracy in detecting wetness on a reference surface. The developed system can be used in SAS for determining accurate disease risks and fungicide recommendations for strawberry production and allows the expansion of the system to multiple locations.

AB Drones are becoming indispensable in emergency search and rescue (SAR), particularly in intricate urban areas where rapid and accurate response is crucial. This study addresses the pressing need for enhancing drone navigation in such complex, dynamic urban environments, where obstacles like building layouts and varying wind conditions create unique challenges. Particularly, the need for adapting drone autonomous navigation in correspondence with dynamic wind conditions in urban settings is emphasized because it is important for drones to avoid loss of control or crashes during SAR. This paper introduces a pioneering method integrating multiobjective reinforcement learning (MORL) with a convolutional autoencoder to train autonomous drones in comprehending and reacting to aerodynamic features in urban SAR. MORL enables the drone to optimize multiple goals, whereas the convolutional autoencoder generates synthetic wind simulations with a substantially lower computation cost compared to traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. A unique data transfer structure is also proposed, which fosters a seamless integration of perception and decision-making between machine learning (ML) and reinforcement learning (RL) components. This approach uses imagery data, specific to building layouts, allowing the drone to autonomously formulate policies, prioritize navigation decisions, optimize paths, and mitigate the impact of wind, all while negating the necessity for conventional aerodynamic force sensors. The method was validated with a model of New York City, offering substantial implications for enhancing automation algorithms in urban SAR. This innovation enables the possibility of more efficient, precise, and timely drone SAR operations within intricate urban landscapes.

AB Distributed research and development (R&D) plays a pivotal role in high-end equipment manufacturing enterprises, significantly impacting interdisciplinary innovation and expediting development cycles. In the uncertain environment characterized by random arrivals of new projects, achieving dynamic scheduling and real-time coordination for decentralized R&D projects is a challenging problem. This paper studies a dynamic decentralized resource-constrained multi-project scheduling problem with product transfers (DDRCMPSP-PT). The objective is to minimize the development cycle after initial local schedules are generated to minimize the individual project makespan. To tackle the problem, we develop a decentralized multi-agent system using the dynamic coordination mechanism for resource assignment (DMAS/DCMRA). An up-to-date deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, dueling double deep Q-learning (D3QN) with prioritized replay, is employed to select the optimal strategy to resolve the global resource conflicts adaptively. Two priority rules are presented based on the structural properties and make up the action space of the DRL agent together with ten high-quality priority rules. Extensive simulation experiment results based on real enterprise cases reveal that the DMAS/DCMRA outperforms all traditional priority rule-based methods. The proposed priority rules also show competitive performance compared to other priority rules, which validates the applicability and superiority of the proposed method. This research offers a new agile project management technique for organizations running multiple R&D projects and managing crucial bottleneck resources.

AB Neuroprosthesis enables the brain control on the external devices purely using neural activity for paralyzed people. Supervised learning decoders recalibrate or re-fit the discrepancy between the desired target and decoder's output, where the correction may over-dominate the user's intention. Reinforcement learning decoder allows users to actively adjust their brain patterns through trial and error, which better represents the subject's motive. The computational challenge is to quickly establish new state-action mapping before the subject becomes frustrated. Recently proposed quantized attention-gated kernel reinforcement learning (QAGKRL) explores the optimal nonlinear neural-action mapping in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). However, considering all past data in RKHS is less efficient and sensitive to detect the new neural patterns emerging in brain control. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based kernel RL algorithm. New neural patterns emerge and are clustered to represent the novel knowledge in brain control. The current neural data only activate the nearest subspace in RKHS for more efficient decoding. The dynamic clustering makes our algorithm more sensitive to new brain patterns. We test our algorithm on both the synthetic and real-world spike data. Compared with QAGKRL, our algorithm can achieve a quicker knowledge adaptation in brain control with less computational complexity.

AB Wireless sensing is an emerging technique which empowers wireless devices with additional sensing ability, that is, the ability to sense the target location, activity, gesture, vital signs, etc., in a device-free manner by analyzing the influence of the target on surrounding wireless signals. Benefiting from its excellent feature extraction and analysis capability, deep learning has emerged as a promising tool to realize wireless sensing. However, the labor intensive training efforts on collecting training samples or retraining a trained system limit its practical application. This article attempts to provide an integrated view on this field and discuss the feasibility of leveraging some new types of deep learning networks to accomplish wireless sensing tasks with less training efforts. Specifically, we first introduce the deep learning based wireless sensing framework, review the methods to construct radio images, and summarize different types of deep learning networks. Then, we focus on new types of deep learning networks which could reduce training efforts from two perspectives, that is, alleviating the efforts of retraining the system in a new scenario by learning a universal similarity evaluation ability utilizing a deep similarity evaluation networks, and reducing the efforts of collecting samples by generating virtual training samples using deep generative adversarial networks. Then, we elaborate existing challenges and forecast future research directions. Finally, we carry out experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the introduced schemes using wireless gesture recognition as the case study.

AB The objective of this study was to find an efficient method for measuring the total soluble solid content (TSSC) and water content of "Luogang" orange. Quick, accurate, and nondestructive detection tools (VIS/NIR spectroscopy, NIR spectroscopy, machine vision, and electronic nose), four data processing methods (Savitzky-Golay (SG), genetic algorithm (GA), multi-source information fusion (MIF), convolutional neural network (CNN) as the deep learning method, and a partial least squares regression (PLSR) modeling method) were compared and investigated. The results showed that the optimal TSSC detection method was based on VIS/NIR and machine vision data fusion and processing and modeling by SG + GA + CNN + PLSR. The R-2 and RMSE of the TSSC detection results were 0.8580 and 0.4276, respectively. The optimal water content detection result was based on VIS/NIR data and processing and modeling by SG + GA + CNN + PLSR. The R-2 and RMSE of the water content detection results were 0.7013 and 0.0063, respectively. This optimized method largely improved the internal quality detection accuracy of "Luogang" orange when compared to the data from a single detection tool with traditional data processing method, and provides a reference for the accuracy improvement of internal quality detection of other fruits.

AB Hydrology is a mature physical science based on application of first principles. However, the water system is complex and its study requires analysis of increasingly large data available from conventional and novel remote sensing and IoT sensor technologies. New data-driven approaches like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are attracting much "hype" despite their apparent limitations (transparency, interpretability, ethics). Some AI/ML applications lack in addressing explicitly important hydrological questions, focusing mainly on "black-box" prediction without providing mechanistic insights. We present a typology of four main types of hydrological problems based on their dominant space and time scales, review their current tools and challenges, and identify important opportunities for AI/ML in hydrology around three main topics: data management, insights and knowledge extraction, and modelling structure. Instead of just for prediction, we propose that AI/ML can be a powerful inductive and exploratory dimension-reduction tool within the rich hydrological toolchest to support the development of new theories that address standing gaps in changing hydrological systems. AI/ML can incorporate other forms of structured and non-structured data and traditional knowledge typically not considered in process-based models. This can help us further advance process-based understanding, forecasting and management of hydrological systems, particularly at larger integrated system scales with big models. We call for reimagining the original definition of AI in hydrology to incorporate not only today's main focus on learning, but on decision analytics and action rules, and on development of autonomous machines in a continuous cycle of learning and refinement in the context of strong ethical, legal, social, and economic constrains. For this, transdisciplinary communities of knowledge and practice will need to be forged with strong investment from the public sector and private engagement to protect water as a common good under accelerated demand and environmental change.

AB Forest inventory forms the foundation of forest management. Remote sensing (RS) is an efficient means of measuring forest parameters at scale. Remotely sensed species classification can be used to estimate species abundances, distributions, and to better approximate metrics such as aboveground biomass. State-of-the-art methods of RS species classification rely on deep-learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These models have two major drawbacks: they require large samples of each species to classify well and they lack explainability. Therefore, rare species are poorly classified causing poor approximations of their associated parameters. We show that the classification of rare species can be improved by as much as eight F1-points using a neuro-symbolic (NS) approach that combines CNNs with an NS framework. The framework allows for the incorporation of domain knowledge into the model through the use of mathematically represented rules, improving model explainability.

TI Kernel Temporal Differences for Neural Decoding
SO COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB We study the feasibility and capability of the kernel temporal difference (KTD)(lambda) algorithm for neural decoding. KTD(lambda) is an online, kernel-based learning algorithm, which has been introduced to estimate value functions in reinforcement learning. This algorithm combines kernel-based representations with the temporal difference approach to learning. One of our key observations is that by using strictly positive definite kernels, algorithm's convergence can be guaranteed for policy evaluation. The algorithm's nonlinear functional approximation capabilities are shown in both simulations of policy evaluation and neural decoding problems (policy improvement). KTD can handle high-dimensional neural states containing spatial-temporal information at a reasonable computational complexity allowing real-time applications. When the algorithmseeks a propermapping between a monkey's neural states and desired positions of a computer cursor or a robot arm, in both open-loop and closed-loop experiments, it can effectively learn the neural state to action mapping. Finally, a visualization of the coadaptation process between the decoder and the subject shows the algorithm's capabilities in reinforcement learning brain machine interfaces.

TI GRAM-CNN: a deep learning approach with local context for named entity
   recognition in biomedical text
SO BIOINFORMATICS
LA English
DT Article
ID NEURAL-NETWORKS; NORMALIZATION
AB Motivation: Best performing named entity recognition (NER) methods for biomedical literature are based on hand-crafted features or task-specific rules, which are costly to produce and difficult to generalize to other corpora. End-to-end neural networks achieve state-of-the-art performance without hand-crafted features and task-specific knowledge in non-biomedical NER tasks. However, in the biomedical domain, using the same architecture does not yield competitive performance compared with conventional machine learning models.
   Results: We propose a novel end-to-end deep learning approach for biomedical NER tasks that leverages the local contexts based on n-gram character and word embeddings via Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). We call this approach GRAM-CNN. To automatically label a word, this method uses the local information around a word. Therefore, the GRAM-CNN method does not require any specific knowledge or feature engineering and can be theoretically applied to a wide range of existing NER problems. The GRAM-CNN approach was evaluated on three well-known biomedical datasets containing different BioNER entities. It obtained an F1-score of 87.26% on the Biocreative II dataset, 87.26% on the NCBI dataset and 72.57% on the JNLPBA dataset. Those results put GRAM-CNN in the lead of the biological NER methods. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply CNN based structures to BioNER problems.

AB Guided wave -based structural health monitoring is an attractive option for detecting structural defects in an automated manner. In this work, we focus on the task of damage localization. Deep learning methods have been shown to have superior performance for damage localization. Yet, environmental variations introduce uncertainty in the system and reduce its reliability. For this reason, it is crucial to assess the reliability of estimates taken from structural health monitoring systems. In this work, we estimate the localization reliability from a single snapshot of sparse array guided wave measurements instead of reporting values averaged over an entire set of test measurements. The assessment strategy can be added to any deep learning localization model and produces both a localization and uncertainty estimate. The deep learning model is trained using only guided wave simulations. We assess the uncertainty using both simulated and experimental data with temperature variations. Multiple deep learning -based uncertainty quantification methods are analyzed. Results demonstrate correlations between uncertainty, temperature variations, and the presence of synthetic damage. We also compare with reliability derived from delay -and -sum localization. We find that a deep ensemble learning strategy provides the most reliable damage localization and uncertainty quantification.

AB With the recent advances in machine learning (ML), several models have been successfully applied to financial and accounting data to predict the likelihood of companies' bankruptcy. However, time series have received little attention in the literature, with a lack of studies on the application of deep learning sequence models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and the recent Attention-based models in general. In this research work, we investigated the application of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to exploit time series of accounting data for bankruptcy prediction. The main contributions of our work are the following: (a) We proposed a multi-head LSTM that models each financial variable in a time window independently and compared it with a single-input LSTM and other traditional ML models. The multi-head LSTM outperformed all the other models. (b) We identified the optimal time series length for bankruptcy prediction to be equal to 4 years of accounting data. (c) We made public the dataset we used for the experiments which includes data from 8262 different public companies in the American stock market generated in the period between 1999 and 2018. Furthermore, we proved the efficacy of the multi-head LSTM model in terms of fewer false positives and the better division of the two classes.

AB Motion-activated wildlife cameras (or "camera traps") are frequently used to remotely and noninvasively observe animals. The vast number of images collected from camera trap projects has prompted some biologists to employ machine learning algorithms to automatically recognize species in these images, or at least filter-out images that do not contain animals. These approaches are often limited by model transferability, as a model trained to recognize species from one location might not work as well for the same species in different locations. Furthermore, these methods often require advanced computational skills, making them inaccessible to many biologists. We used 3 million camera trap images from 18 studies in 10 states across the United States of America to train two deep neural networks, one that recognizes 58 species, the "species model," and one that determines if an image is empty or if it contains an animal, the "empty-animal model." Our species model and empty-animal model had accuracies of 96.8% and 97.3%, respectively. Furthermore, the models performed well on some out-of-sample datasets, as the species model had 91% accuracy on species from Canada (accuracy range 36%-91% across all out-of-sample datasets) and the empty-animal model achieved an accuracy of 91%-94% on out-of-sample datasets from different continents. Our software addresses some of the limitations of using machine learning to classify images from camera traps. By including many species from several locations, our species model is potentially applicable to many camera trap studies in North America. We also found that our empty-animal model can facilitate removal of images without animals globally. We provide the trained models in an R package (MLWIC2: Machine Learning for Wildlife Image Classification in R), which contains Shiny Applications that allow scientists with minimal programming experience to use trained models and train new models in six neural network architectures with varying depths.

AB Objective: To develop a natural language processing system that solves both clinical concept extraction and relation extraction in a unified prompt-based machine reading comprehension (MRC) architecture with good generalizability for cross-institution applications.Methods: We formulate both clinical concept extraction and relation extraction using a unified prompt-based MRC architecture and explore state-of-the-art transformer models. We compare our MRC models with existing deep learning models for concept extraction and end-to-end relation extraction using 2 benchmark datasets developed by the 2018 National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2) challenge (medications and adverse drug events) and the 2022 n2c2 challenge (relations of social determinants of health [SDoH]). We also evaluate the transfer learning abil-ity of the proposed MRC models in a cross-institution setting. We perform error analyses and examine how different prompting strategies affect the performance of MRC models.Results and Conclusion: The proposed MRC models achieve state-of-the-art performance for clinical concept and relation extraction on the 2 benchmark datasets, outperforming previous non-MRC transformer models. GatorTron-MRC achieves the best strict and lenient F1-scores for concept extraction, outperforming previous deep learning models on the 2 datasets by 1%-3% and 0.7%-1.3%, respectively. For end-to-end relation extraction, GatorTron-MRC and BERT-MIMIC-MRC achieve the best F1-scores, outperforming previous deep learning models by 0.9%- 2.4% and 10%-11%, respectively. For cross-institution evaluation, GatorTron-MRC outperforms traditional GatorTron by 6.4% and 16% for the 2 datasets, respectively. The proposed method is better at handling nested/overlapped concepts, extracting relations, and has good portability for cross-institute applications. Our clinical MRC package is publicly available at https://github.com/uf-hobi-informatics-lab/ ClinicalTransformerMRC.

AB Timely, accurate maps of invasive plant species are critical for making appropriate management decisions to eliminate emerging target populations or contain infestations. High-resolution aerial imagery is routinely used to map, monitor, and detect invasive plant populations. While conventional image interpretation involving human analysts is straightforward, it can require high demands for time and resources to produce useful intelligence. We compared the performance of human analysts with a custom Retinanet-based deep convolutional neural network (DNN) for detecting individual miconia (Miconia calvescens DC) plants, using high-resolution unmanned aerial system (UAS) imagery collected over lowland tropical forests in Hawai'i. Human analysts (n = 38) examined imagery at three linear scrolling speeds (100, 200 and 300 px/s), achieving miconia detection recalls of 74 +/- 3%, 60 +/- 3%, and 50 +/- 3%, respectively. The DNN achieved 83 +/- 3% recall and completed the image analysis in 1% of the time of the fastest scrolling speed tested. Human analysts could discriminate large miconia leaf clusters better than isolated individual leaves, while the DNN detection efficacy was independent of leaf cluster size. Optically, the contrast in the red and green color channels and all three (i.e., red, green, and blue) signal to clutter ratios (SCR) were significant factors for human detection, while only the red channel contrast, and the red and green SCRs were significant factors for the DNN. A linear cost analysis estimated the operational use of a DNN to be more cost effective than human photo interpretation when the cumulative search area exceeds a minimum area. For invasive species like miconia, which can stochastically spread propagules across thousands of ha, the DNN provides a more efficient option for detecting incipient, immature miconia across large expanses of forested canopy. Increasing operational capacity for large-scale surveillance with a DNN-based image analysis workflow can provide more rapid comprehension of invasive plant abundance and distribution in forested watersheds and may become strategically vital to containing these invasions.

AB Deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) requires massive training datasets to trigger its image classification power, while collecting training samples for remote sensing application is usually an expensive process. When DCNN is simply implemented with traditional object-based image analysis (OBIA) for classification of Unmanned Aerial systems (UAS) orthoimage, its power may be undermined if the number training samples is relatively small. This research aims to develop a novel OBIA classification approach that can take advantage of DCNN by enriching the training dataset automatically using multi-view data. Specifically, this study introduces a Multi-View Object-based classification using Deep convolutional neural network (MODe) method to process UAS images for land cover classification. MODe conducts the classification on multi-view UAS images instead of directly on the orthoimage, and gets the final results via a voting procedure. 10-fold cross validation results show the mean overall classification accuracy increasing substantially from 65.32%, when DCNN was applied on the orthoimage to 82.08% achieved when MODe was implemented. This study also compared the performances of the support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) classifiers with DCNN under traditional OBIA and the proposed multi-view OBIA frameworks. The results indicate that the advantage of DCNN over traditional classifiers in terms of accuracy is more obvious when these classifiers were applied with the proposed multi-view OBIA framework than when these classifiers were applied within the traditional OBIA framework.

AB In this paper, we demonstrate how machine learning could be used to quickly assess a student's multimodal representational thinking. Multimodal representational thinking is the complex construct that encodes how students form conceptual, perceptual, graphical, or mathematical symbols in their mind. The augmented reality (AR) technology is adopted to diversify student's representations. The AR technology utilized a low-cost, high-resolution thermal camera attached to a smartphone which allows students to explore the unseen world of thermodynamics. Ninth-grade students (N = 314) engaged in a prediction-observation-explanation (POE) inquiry cycle scaffolded to leverage the augmented observation provided by the aforementioned device. The objective is to investigate how machine learning could expedite the automated assessment of multimodal representational thinking of heat energy. Two automated text classification methods were adopted to decode different mental representations students used to explain their haptic perception, thermal imaging, and graph data collected in the lab. Since current automated assessment in science education rarely considers multilabel classification, we resorted to the help of the state-of-the-art deep learning technique-bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT). The BERT model classified open-ended responses into appropriate categories with higher precision than the traditional machine learning method. The satisfactory accuracy of deep learning in assigning multiple labels is revolutionary in processing qualitative data. The complex student construct, such as multimodal representational thinking, is rarely mutually exclusive. The study avails a convenient technique to analyze qualitative data that does not satisfy the mutual-exclusiveness assumption. Implications and future studies are discussed.

AB Introduction: Photorealistic simulations may provide efficient transfer of certain skills to the real system, but by being opaque may fail to encourage deeper learning of the structure and function of the system. Schematic simulations that are more abstract, with less visual fidelity but make system structure and function transparent, may enhance deeper learning and optimize retention and transfer of learning. We compared learning effectiveness of these 2 modes of externalizing the output of a common simulation engine (the Virtual Anesthesia Machine, VAM) that models machine function and dynamics and responds in real time to user interventions such as changes in gas flow or ventilation.
   Methods: Undergraduate students (n = 39) and medical students (n = 35) were given a single, 1-hour guided learning session with either a Transparent or an Opaque version of the VAM simulation. The following day, the learners' knowledge of machine components, function, and dynamics was tested.
   Results: The Transparent-VAM groups scored higher than the Opaque-VAM groups on a set of multiple-choice questions concerning conceptual knowledge about anesthesia machines (P = 0.009), provided better and more complete explanations of component function (P = 0.003), and were more accurate in remembering and inferring cause-and-effect dynamics of the machine and relations among components (P = 0.003). Although the medical students outperformed undergraduates on all measures, a similar pattern of benefits for the Transparent VAM was observed for these 2 groups.
   Conclusions: Schematic simulations that transparently allow learners to visualize, and explore, underlying system dynamics and relations among components may provide a more effective mental model for certain systems. This may lead to a deeper understanding of how the system works, and therefore, we believe, how to detect and respond to potentially adverse situations. (Sim Healthcare 3:26-32, 2008)

AB Traditional sensing technologies in specialty crops production, for pest and disease detection and field phenotyping, rely on manual sampling and are time consuming and labor intensive. Since availability of personnel trained for field scouting is a major problem, small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with various sensors can simplify the surveying procedure, decrease data collection time, and reduce cost. To accurate and rapidly process, analyze and visualize data collected from UAVs and other platforms (e.g. small airplanes, satellites, ground platforms), a cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) based application (named Agroview) was developed. This interactive and user-friendly application can: (i) detect, count and geo-locate plants and plant gaps (locations with dead or no plants); (ii) measure plant height and canopy size (plant inventory); (iii) develop plant health (or stress) maps. In this study, the use of this Agroview application to evaluate phenotypic characteristics of citrus trees (as a case study) is presented. It was found, that this emerging technology detected citrus trees with mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 2.3% in a commercial citrus orchard with 175,977 trees (1,871 acres; 39 normal and high-density spacing blocks). Furthermore, it accurately estimated tree height with 4.5% and 12.93% MAPE for normal and high-density spacing respectively, and canopy size with MAPE of 12.9% and 34.6% for normal and high-density spacing respectively. It provides a consistent, more direct, costeffective and rapid method for field survey and plant phenotyping.

AB Intelligent control of soft robots is challenging due to the nonlinear and difficult-to-model dynamics. One promising model-free approach for soft robot control is reinforcement learning (RL). However, model-free RL methods tend to be computationally expensive and data-inefficient and may not yield natural and smooth locomotion patterns for soft robots. In this work, we develop a bioinspired design of a learning-based goal-tracking controller for a soft snake robot. The controller is composed of two modules: An RL module for learning goal-tracking behaviors given the unmodeled and stochastic dynamics of the robot, and a central pattern generator (CPG) with the Matsuoka oscillators for generating stable and diverse locomotion patterns. We theoretically investigate the maneuverability of Matsuoka CPG's oscillation bias, frequency, and amplitude for steering control, velocity control, and sim-to-real adaptation of the soft snake robot. Based on this analysis, we proposed a composition of RL and CPG modules such that the RL module regulates the tonic inputs to the CPG system given state feedback from the robot, and the output of the CPG module is then transformed into pressure inputs to pneumatic actuators of the soft snake robot. This design allows the RL agent to naturally learn to entrain the desired locomotion patterns determined by the CPG maneuverability. We validated the optimality and robustness of the control design in both simulation and real experiments, and performed extensive comparisons with state-of-art RL methods to demonstrate the benefit of our bioinspired control design.

AB Heterogeneous ensemble learning has received increasing attention in building energy prediction research because it provides more stable and accurate predictions than the conventional single model -based methods. Although existing studies have proved the feasibility of adopting heterogeneous ensem-ble learning in building energy prediction, they have not fully explored the method of constructing an optimal heterogeneous ensemble learning model based on limited base model resources. This paper attempts to identify the optimal heterogeneous ensemble learning model for building energy prediction by using the exhaustive search method. Six machine learning methods are used as the alternative base model for constructing heterogeneous ensemble learning models. All 57 heterogeneous ensemble learn-ing models that can be built from the six base models are compared and the optimal model is identified. The hourly building energy prediction experiment is performed on an institutional building located at the University of Florida to verify the proposed exhaustive search method. Three modules representing dif-ferent semesters of the test building are developed and tested to examine the predictive performance of the proposed heterogeneous ensemble learning models. The research findings demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed exhaustive search method in identifying the optimal heterogeneous ensemble learning model. The optimal heterogeneous ensemble learning model found in this study can reduce the MAPE by 4.9% -6.6% compared with its most accurate base model in the model testing stage. The experimental results and research findings provide critical guidance for applying heterogeneous ensemble learning to data-driven building energy prediction. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB Machine learning (ML) is increasingly implemented to model water infrastructure dynamics. Common ML models are primarily data-driven and require a significant amount of data for robust training. Often, obtaining robust data at higher temporal and spatial resolutions in water systems can be challenging due to cost and time considerations. In such scenarios, integrating the existing scientific knowledge into an ML model as physics-informed ML can be advantageous to enhance predictive capability and generalizability. This study examines the predictive capability and generalizability of physics-informed ML and common ML models for typical unit operation and process (UOP) system dynamics in urban water treatment. The systems studied are (1) a continuous stirred-tank reactor, (2) activated sludge reactor, and a (3) fixed-bed granular adsorption reactor. Applications of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are presented. Results demonstrate when the availability of data is limited: (1) common ML models are not necessarily robust for predicting water system dynamics, except when system dynamics exhibit simpler periodic patterns. Common ML models also do not generalize across different loading conditions. (2) In contrast, the developed PINN models yield high predictive capability and generalizability. (3) Benefiting from the embedded prior knowledge, PINNs require significantly reduced data sets for robust predictions. These results suggest hybridizing physics principles and domain knowledge into the ML framework can be critical for robust UOP and water systems modeling.

AB This paper is concerned with the efficient movement control of multiple drone cells for communication coverage. Although many works have been developed to cope with this problem, but only few of them have investigated the three-dimensional (3-D) continuous movement control of multiple drone cells. In this paper, a problem of 3-D continuous movement control of multiple drone cells is formulated with an objective of maximizing the energy-efficient communication coverage of drone-cell networks while preserving the network connectivity. To mitigate this challenging problem, an energy-efficiency and continuous-movementcontrol algorithm (E2CMC), which is based on an emerging deep reinforcement learning method, is proposed. InE2CMC, an energy-efficiency reward function considering the energy consumption, the sum of quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of users as well as the coverage fairness is first designed. Next, E2CMC learns to adjust drone cells' locations continuously by interacting with an environment in a sequence of observations, actions, and rewards. Furthermore, E2CMC will reduce the reward drastically as long as the networks are disconnected. Simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed learning algorithm on deploying multiple drone cells to provide the communication coverage.

AB Background: Surgical patients incur preventable harm from cognitive and judgment errors made under time constraints and uncertainty regarding patients diagnoses and predicted response to treatment. Decision analysis and techniques of reinforcement learning theoretically can mitigate these challenges but are poorly understood and rarely used clinically. This review seeks to promote an understanding of decision analysis and reinforcement learning by describing their use in the context of surgical decision-making.
   Methods: Cochrane, EMBASE, and PubMed databases were searched from their inception to June 2019. Included were 41 articles about cognitive and diagnostic errors, decision-making, decision analysis, and machine-learning. The articles were assimilated into relevant categories according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines.
   Results: Requirements for time-consuming manual data entry and crude representations of individual patients and clinical context compromise many traditional decision-support tools. Decision analysis methods for calculating probability thresholds can inform population-based recommendations that jointly consider risks, benefits, costs, and patient values but lack precision for individual patient-centered decisions. Reinforcement learning, a machine-learning method that mimics human learning, can use a large set of patient-specific input data to identify actions yielding the greatest probability of achieving a goal. This methodology follows a sequence of events with uncertain conditions, offering potential advantages for personalized, patient-centered decision-making. Clinical application would require secure integration of multiple data sources and attention to ethical considerations regarding liability for errors and individual patient preferences.
   Conclusion: Traditional decision-support tools are ill-equipped to accommodate time constraints and uncertainty regarding diagnoses and the predicted response to treatment, both of which often impair surgical decision-making. Decision analysis and reinforcement learning have the potential to play complementary roles in delivering high-value surgical care through sound judgment and optimal decision-making.

ID CONFINEMENT
AB Recent work has applied supervised deep learning to derive continuous symmetry transformations that preserve the data labels and to obtain the corresponding algebras of symmetry generators. This letter introduces two improved algorithms that significantly speed up the discovery of these symmetry transformations. The new methods are demonstrated by deriving the complete set of generators for the unitary groups U(n) and the exceptional Lie groups G2, F4, and E6. A third post-processing algorithm renders the found generators in sparse form. We benchmark the performance improvement of the new algorithms relative to the standard approach. Given the significant complexity of the exceptional Lie groups, our results demonstrate that this machine-learning method for discovering symmetries is completely general and can be applied to a wide variety of labeled datasets.

ID FINANCIAL MARKET; PROFITABILITY; MOMENTUM
AB In this paper we investigate the role of self-learning agents in multi-agent models of financial markets. We develop an agent-based simulation model of a financial market and, in addition to the agents with fixed strategies used in previous research, we introduce an agent with a self-learning strategy. To model the behavior of such an agent, we use deep reinforcement learning algorithms, namely deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG). Next, we conduct a comparative analysis of the results of the constructed model with outcomes of previously proposed models, as well as with the characteristics of real market. To conduct comparative analysis, we use stylized facts of asset returns that allow us to evaluate and compare the characteristics of the markets. Our results show that a model with a self-learning agent gives a better approximation of the real market than a model with classic agents. In particular, unlike the model with classical agents, the model with a self-learning agent turns out to be not so heavy-tailed. Thus, we demonstrate that for a complete understanding of market processes simulation models should take into account self-learning agents that have a significant presence at modern financial markets.Finally, we present the python package1, which was developed by us as part of the research implementation. This package allows to simulate the financial market, as well as create your own agents and evaluate their impact on the market.

AB Background Brain metastasis invasion pattern (BMIP) is an emerging biomarker associated with recurrence-free and overall survival in patients, and differential response to therapy in preclinical models. Currently, BMIP can only be determined from the histopathological examination of surgical specimens, precluding its use as a biomarker prior to therapy initiation. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of machine learning (ML) approaches to develop a noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based biomarker for BMIP determination.Methods From an initial cohort of 329 patients, a subset of 132 patients met the inclusion criteria for this retrospective study. We evaluated the ability of an expert neuroradiologist to reliably predict BMIP. Thereafter, the dataset was randomly divided into training/validation (80% of cases) and test subsets (20% of cases). The ground truth for BMIP was the histopathologic evaluation of resected specimens. Following MRI sequence co-registration, advanced feature extraction techniques deriving hand-crafted radiomic features with traditional ML classifiers and convolution-based deep learning (CDL) models were trained and evaluated. Different ML approaches were used individually or using ensembling techniques to determine the model with the best performance for BMIP prediction.Results Expert evaluation of brain MRI scans could not reliably predict BMIP, with an accuracy of 44%-59% depending on the semantic feature used. Among the different ML and CDL models evaluated, the best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 85% and an F1 score of 90%.Conclusions ML approaches can effectively predict BMIP, representing a noninvasive MRI-based approach to guide the management of patients with brain metastases.

AB Objectives: To compare detection patterns of 80 cephalometric landmarks identified by an automated identification system (AI) based on a recently proposed deep-learning method, the You-Only-Look-Once version 3 (YOLOv3), with those identified by human examiners.
   Materials and Methods: The YOLOv3 algorithm was implemented with custom modifications and trained on 1028 cephalograms. A total of 80 landmarks comprising two vertical reference points and 46 hard tissue and 32 soft tissue landmarks were identified. On the 283 test images, the same 80 landmarks were identified by AI and human examiners twice. Statistical analyses were conducted to detect whether any significant differences between AI and human examiners existed. Influence of image factors on those differences was also investigated.
   Results: Upon repeated trials, AI always detected identical positions on each landmark, while the human intraexaminer variability of repeated manual detections demonstrated a detection error of 0.97 +/- 1.03 mm. The mean detection error between AI and human was 1.46 +/- 2.97 mm. The mean difference between human examiners was 1.50 +/- 1.48 mm. In general, comparisons in the detection errors between AI and human examiners were less than 0.9 mm, which did not seem to be clinically significant.
   Conclusions: AI showed as accurate an identification of cephalometric landmarks as did human examiners. AI might be a viable option for repeatedly identifying multiple cephalometric landmarks.

AB Prediction of chemical bioactivity and physical properties has been one of the most important applications of statistical and more recently, machine learning and artificial intelligence methods in chemical sciences. This field of research, broadly known as quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) modeling, has developed many important algorithms and has found a broad range of applications in physical organic and medicinal chemistry in the past 55+ years. This Perspective summarizes recent technological advances in QSAR modeling but it also highlights the applicability of algorithms, modeling methods, and validation practices developed in QSAR to a wide range of research areas outside of traditional QSAR boundaries including synthesis planning, nanotechnology, materials science, biomaterials, and clinical informatics. As modern research methods generate rapidly increasing amounts of data, the knowledge of robust data-driven modelling methods professed within the QSAR field can become essential for scientists working both within and outside of chemical research. We hope that this contribution highlighting the generalizable components of QSAR modeling will serve to address this challenge.

AB Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a severe and disabling facial pain condition and is characterized by intermittent, severe, electric shock-like pain in one (or more) trigeminal subdivisions. This pain can be triggered by an innocuous stimulus or can be spontaneous. Presently available therapies for TN include both surgical and pharmacological management; however, the lack of a known etiology for TN contributes to the unpredictable response to treatment and the variability in long-term clinical outcomes. Given this, a range of peripheral and central mechanisms underlying TN pain remain to be understood. We acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from TN patients who (1) rested comfortably in the scanner during a resting state session and (2) rated their pain levels in real time using a calibrated tracking ball-controlled scale in a pain tracking session. Following data acquisition, the data was analyzed using the conventional correlation analysis and two artificial intelligence (AI)-inspired deep learning methods: convolutional neural network (CNN) and graph convolutional neural network (GCNN). Each of the three methods yielded a set of brain regions related to the generation and perception of pain in TN. There were 6 regions that were identified by all three methods, including the superior temporal cortex, the insula, the fusiform, the precentral gyrus, the superior frontal gyrus, and the supramarginal gyrus. Additionally, 17 regions, including dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the thalamus, were identified by at least two of the three methods. Collectively, these 23 regions are taken to represent signature centers of TN pain and provide target areas for future studies seeking to understand the central mechanisms of TN.

AB Integrating prior epidemiological knowledge embedded within mechanistic models with the data-mining capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) offers transformative potential for epidemiological modeling. While the fusion of AI and traditional mechanistic approaches is rapidly advancing, efforts remain fragmented. This scoping review provides a comprehensive overview of emerging integrated models applied across the spectrum of infectious diseases. Through systematic search strategies, we identified 245 eligible studies from 15,460 records. Our review highlights the practical value of integrated models, including advances in disease forecasting, model parameterization, and calibration. However, key research gaps remain. These include the need for better incorporation of realistic decision-making considerations, expanded exploration of diverse datasets, and further investigation into biological and socio-behavioral mechanisms. Addressing these gaps will unlock the synergistic potential of AI and mechanistic modeling to enhance understanding of disease dynamics and support more effective public health planning and response.

AB Social media has the unique capacity to expose many learners to media literacy instruction via targeted campaigns. Investigating learner engagement and reaction to these efforts may be a fruitful endeavor for researchers that can inform the design of future campaigns. However, the massive datasets associated with social media posts are difficult, and often impossible, to analyze with traditional qualitative methods. This study seeks to address this problem by leveraging machine learning techniques to collect and analyze Big Data from two different media literacy campaigns on the youth-oriented social media platform TikTok. Specifically, we explore the ways topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and network analysis can provide insight into learner engagement with these campaigns and discuss limitations and implications for stakeholders interested in utilizing these approaches.

ID SEGMENTATION
AB Minirhizotron technology is widely used to study root growth and development. Yet, standard approaches for tracing roots in minirhiztron imagery is extremely tedious and time consuming. Machine learning approaches can help to automate this task. However, lack of enough annotated training data is a major limitation for the application of machine learning methods. Transfer learning is a useful technique to help with training when available datasets are limited. In this paper, we investigated the effect of pre-trained features from the massivescale, irrelevant ImageNet dataset and a relatively moderate-scale, but relevant peanut root dataset on switchgrass root imagery segmentation applications. We compiled two minirhizotron image datasets to accomplish this study: one with 17,550 peanut root images and another with 28 switchgrass root images. Both datasets were paired with manually labeled ground truth masks. Deep neural networks based on the U-net architecture were used with different pre-trained features as initialization for automated, precise pixel-wise root segmentation in minirhizotron imagery. We observed that features pre-trained on a closely related but relatively moderate size dataset like our peanut dataset were more effective than features pre-trained on the large but unrelated ImageNet dataset. We achieved high quality segmentation on peanut root dataset with 99.04% accuracy at the pixel-level and overcame errors in human-labeled ground truth masks. By applying transfer learning technique on limited switchgrass dataset with features pre-trained on peanut dataset, we obtained 99% segmentation accuracy in switchgrass imagery using only 21 images for training (fine tuning). Furthermore, the peanut pre-trained features can help the model converge faster and have much more stable performance. We presented a demo of plant root segmentation for all models under https://github.com/GatorSense/PlantRootSeg.

AB In this community review report, we discuss applications and techniques for fast machine learning (ML) in science-the concept of integrating powerful ML methods into the real-time experimental data processing loop to accelerate scientific discovery. The material for the report builds on two workshops held by the Fast ML for Science community and covers three main areas: applications for fast ML across a number of scientific domains; techniques for training and implementing performant and resource-efficient ML algorithms; and computing architectures, platforms, and technologies for deploying these algorithms. We also present overlapping challenges across the multiple scientific domains where common solutions can be found. This community report is intended to give plenty of examples and inspiration for scientific discovery through integrated and accelerated ML solutions. This is followed by a high-level overview and organization of technical advances, including an abundance of pointers to source material, which can enable these breakthroughs.

AB The detection of neutrons above background levels is an indication of nuclear materials, creating significant applications for handheld neutron detectors in homeland security. For such applications, a B-10 and Li-6 enriched, scintillating glass neutron detector was designed. The model is compact enough to be used as a handheld detector and is equipped with machine learning capabilities to determine the location of the source and discriminate a neutron from a gamma. Lithium Borosilicate glass samples, with up to 70% B-10 and Li-6 content, and doped with Tb and Eu, were engineered to optimize the performance of the detector. The scintillation properties and neutron/gamma detection capabilities of the glass samples were tested. The model detector's performance was simulated in Geant4 and the simulation data was utilized for machine learning to predict the location of the source with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The reported handheld neutron detector design with the implemented artificial intelligence capability can achieve 99.9% accuracy in neutron/gamma discrimination, 8.9% error in radial angle estimates, and 2.9% error in azimuthal angle estimates.

AB Saffron is a well-known product in the food industry. It is one of the spices that are sometimes adulterated with the sole motive of gaining more economic profit. Today, machine vision systems are widely used in controlling the quality of food and agricultural products as a new, non-destructive, and inexpensive approach. In this study, a machine vision system based on deep learning was used to detect fraud and saffron quality. A dataset of 1869 images was created and categorized in 6 classes including: dried saffron stigma using a dryer; dried saffron stigma using pressing method; pure stem of saffron; sunflower; saffron stem mixed with food coloring; and corn silk mixed with food coloring. A Learning-to-Augment incorporated Inception-v4 Convolutional Neural Network (LAII-v4 CNN) was developed for grading and fraud detection of saffron in images captured by smartphones. The best policies of data augmentation were selected with the proposed LAII-v4 CNN using images corrupted by Gaussian, speckle, and impulse noise to address overfitting the model. The proposed LAII-v4 CNN compared with regular CNN-based methods and traditional classifiers. Ensemble of Bagged Decision Trees, Ensemble of Boosted Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbor, Random Under-sampling Boosted Trees, and Support Vector Machine were used for classification of the features extracted by Histograms of Oriented Gradients and Local Binary Patterns, and selected by the Principal Component Analysis. The results showed that the proposed LAII-v4 CNN with an accuracy of 99.5% has achieved the best performance by employing batch normalization, Dropout, and leaky ReLU.

ID FLOW
AB Traffic flow dynamics in the vicinity of urban arterial intersections is a complex and nonlinear phenomenon, influenced by factors such as signal timing plan, road geometry, driver behaviors, etc. Predicting such flow dynamics is an important task for urban traffic signal control and planning. Current methods use microscopic simulation for studying the impact of a large number of signal timing plans at each of the intersections. A major drawback of microscopic simulation is that they are they are based on source destination traffic generation models and cannot incorporate the high resolution loop detector data such as that are provided by automated traffic signal performance measures (ATSPM) based systems. The arrival (or departure) information of each vehicle on a detector can be thought of as a time series waveform. Given the high granularity of ATSPM data, this waveform can be used to several interesting analyses. The waveforms can be used to derive information on platoon dispersion as vehicles progress across the corridor. Also, these waveforms can be modelled to understand how the vehicles progress across the corridor for a variety of signal timing plans. In this paper, we show that deep neural networks based machine learning systems can be used to effectively leverage the waveforms collected at multiple sensors (stopbar and advanced) on the intersection to model the traffic dynamics both at an intersection and across intersections. We show that modelling of these waveforms can be useful to understand traffic flow dynamics under different signal timing plans and can be potentially integrated into signal timing optimization software. Further, these methods are three to four orders of magnitudes faster than using microscopic simulations.

AB We present a machine-learning (ML) approach for estimating galaxy cluster masses from Chandra mock images. We utilize a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a deep ML tool commonly used in image recognition tasks. The CNN is trained and tested on our sample of 7896 Chandra X-ray mock observations, which are based on 329 massive clusters from the IllustrisTNG simulation. Our CNN learns from a low resolution spatial distribution of photon counts and does not use spectral information. Despite our simplifying assumption to neglect spectral information, the resulting mass values estimated by the CNN exhibit small bias in comparison to the true masses of the simulated clusters (-0.02 dex) and reproduce the cluster masses with low intrinsic scatter, 8% in our best fold and 12% averaging over all. In contrast, a more standard core-excised luminosity method achieves 15%-18% scatter. We interpret the results with an approach inspired by Google DeepDream and find that the CNN ignores the central regions of clusters, which are known to have high scatter with mass.

AB The next generation of intelligent traffic signal control systems needs multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms that can track vehicles hundreds of meters away from traffic intersections. To facilitate the integration of long-range MOT into existing traffic infrastructure, the tracker must achieve a good balance of cost-effectiveness, accuracy, and efficiency. Although much progress has been made on deep-learning-based MOT for video, these approaches have limited applicability for edge deployment since deep neural networks typically require power-hungry hardware accelerators to achieve real-time performance. Furthermore, traffic cameras have a field of view limited to near the intersection. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a practical MOT framework that fuses tracks from a novel video MOT neural architecture designed for low-power edge devices with tracks from a commercially available traffic radar. The proposed neural architecture achieves high efficiency by using depthwise separable convolutions to jointly predict object detections alongside a dense grid of features at a single scale for spatiotemporal object re-identification. A simple and effective late fusion strategy is also presented where tracks of distant vehicles from a traffic radar are handed over to the video tracker within a region where the sensor fields of view overlap. Our video tracker is empirically validated on the UA-DETRAC video MOT benchmark for traffic intersections and the multi-sensor tracker is evaluated on video and radar data collected and labeled by the authors at an instrumented traffic intersection.

AB Building energy use prediction plays an important role in building energy management and conservation as it can help us to evaluate building energy efficiency, conduct building commissioning, and detect and diagnose building system faults. Building energy prediction can be broadly classified into engineering, Artificial Intelligence (AI) based, and hybrid approaches. While engineering and hybrid approaches use thermodynamic equations to estimate energy use, the AI-based approach uses historical data to predict future energy use under constraints. Owing to the ease of use and adaptability to seek optimal solutions in a rapid manner, the AI-based approach has gained popularity in recent years. For this reason and to discuss recent developments in the AI based approaches for building energy use prediction, this paper conducts an in-depth review of single AI-based methods such as multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks, and support vector regression, and ensemble prediction method that, by combining multiple single AI-based prediction models improves the prediction accuracy manifold. This paper elaborates the principles, applications, advantages and limitations of these AI-based prediction methods and concludes with a discussion on the future directions of the research on AI-based methods for building energy use prediction.

AB Objectives: Prediction of post-transplant health outcomes and identification of key factors remain important issues for pediatric transplant teams and researchers. Outcomes research has generally relied on general linear modeling or similar techniques offering limited predictive validity. Thus far, data-driven modeling and machine learning (ML) approaches have had limited application and success in pediatric transplant outcomes research. The purpose of the current study was to examine ML models predicting post-transplant hospitalization in a sample of pediatric kidney, liver, and heart transplant recipients from a large solid organ transplant program.
   Materials and Methods: Various logistic regression, naive Bayes, support vector machine, and deep learning (DL) methods were used to predict 1-, 3-, and 5-year post-transplant hospitalization using patient and administrative data from a large pediatric organ transplant center.
   Results: DL models did not outperform traditional ML models across organ types and prediction windows with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values ranging from 0.50 to 0.593. Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) were used to increase the interpretability of DL model results. Various medical, patient, and social variables were identified as salient predictors across organ types.
   Discussion: Results showed that deep learning models did not yield superior performance in comparison to models using traditional machine learning methods. However, the potential utility of deep learning modeling for health outcome prediction with pediatric patients in the presence of large number of samples warrants further examination.
   Conclusion: Results point to DL models as potentially useful tools in decision-support systems assisting physicians and transplant teams in identifying patients at a greater risk for poor post-transplant outcomes.

AB Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers unprecedented insights into transcriptome-wide gene expression at the single-cell level. Cell clustering has been long established in the analysis of scRNA-seq data to identify the groups of cells with similar expression profiles. However, cell clustering is technically challenging, as raw scRNA-seq data have various analytical issues, including high dimensionality and dropout values. Existing research has developed deep learning models, such as graph machine learning models and contrastive learning-based models, for cell clustering using scRNA-seq data and has summarized the unsupervised learning of cell clustering into a human-interpretable format. While advances in cell clustering have been profound, we are no closer to finding a simple yet effective framework for learning high-quality representations necessary for robust clustering. In this study, we propose scSimGCL, a novel framework based on the graph contrastive learning paradigm for self-supervised pretraining of graph neural networks. This framework facilitates the generation of high-quality representations crucial for cell clustering. Our scSimGCL incorporates cell-cell graph structure and contrastive learning to enhance the performance of cell clustering. Extensive experimental results on simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets suggest the superiority of the proposed scSimGCL. Moreover, clustering assignment analysis confirms the general applicability of scSimGCL, including state-of-the-art clustering algorithms. Further, ablation study and hyperparameter analysis suggest the efficacy of our network architecture with the robustness of decisions in the self-supervised learning setting. The proposed scSimGCL can serve as a robust framework for practitioners developing tools for cell clustering. The source code of scSimGCL is publicly available at https://github.com/zhangzh1328/scSimGCL.

AB Fruit infected by pests or diseases and fruit harvests with different levels of ripeness cause a lack of marketability, decrease in economic value, and increase in crop waste. In this study, we propose a robust and generalized deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model via fine-tuning the pre-trained models for detecting black spot disease and ripeness levels in orange fruit. A dataset containing 1896 confirmed orange images in the farm in four classes (unripe, half-ripe, ripe, and infected with black spot disease) was used. In order to prevent overfitting and increase the robustness and generalizability of the model, instead of using fundamental data augmentation techniques, a novel learning-to-augment strategy that creates new data using noisy and restored images was employed. Controllers using the Bayesian optimization algorithm were utilized to select the optimal noise pa-rameters of Gaussian, speckle, Poisson, and salt-and-pepper noise to generate new noisy images. A convolutional autoencoder model was developed to produce newly restored images affected by optimized noise density. The dataset augmented by the best policies of the learning-to-augment strategy was used to fine-tune several pre -trained models (GoogleNet, ResNet18, ResNet50, ShuffleNet, MobileNetv2, and DenseNet201). The results showed that the learning-to-augment strategy for the fine-tuned ResNet50 achieved the best performance with 99.5% accuracy, and 100% F-measure by assigning images infected with black spot disease as the positive class.

AB The Banff Digital Pathology Working Group (DPWG) was established with the goal to establish a digital pathology repository; develop, validate, and share models for image analysis; and foster collaborations using regular videoconferencing. During the calls, a variety of artificial intelligence (AI)-based support systems for transplantation pathology were presented. Potential collaborations in a competition/trial on AI applied to kidney transplant specimens, including the DIAGGRAFT challenge (staining of biopsies at multiple institutions, pathologists' visual assessment, and development and validation of new and pre-existing Banff scoring algorithms), were also discussed. To determine the next steps, a survey was conducted, primarily focusing on the feasibility of establishing a digital pathology repository and identifying potential hosts. Sixteen of the 35 respondents (46%) had access to a server hosting a digital pathology repository, with 2 respondents that could serve as a potential host at no cost to the DPWG. The 16 digital pathology repositories collected specimens from various organs, with the largest constituent being kidney (n = 12,870 specimens). A DPWG pilot digital pathology repository was established, and there are plans for a competition/trial with the DIAGGRAFT project. Utilizing existing resources and previously established models, the Banff DPWG is establishing new resources for the Banff community.

AB Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) generated a global public health emergency since December 2019, causing huge economic losses. To help radiologists strengthen their recognition of COVID-19 cases, we developed a computer-aided diagnosis system based on deep learning to automatically classify chest computed tomography-based COVID-19, Tuberculosis, and healthy control subjects. Our novel classification model AdaD-FNN sequentially transfers the trained knowledge of an FNN estimator to the next FNN estimator while updating the weights of the samples in the training set with a decaying learning rate. This model inhibits the network from remembering the noisy information and improves the learning of complex patterns in the hard-to-identify samples. Moreover, we designed a novel image preprocessing model F-U2MNet-C by enhancing the image features using fuzzy stacking and eliminating the interference factors using U2MNet segmentation. Extensive experiments are conducted on four publicly available datasets namely, TLDCA, UCSD-Al4H, SARS-CoV-2, TCIA, and the obtained classification accuracies are 99.52%, 92.96%, 97.86%, 91.97%. Our novel system gives out compelling performance for assisting COVID-19 detection when compared with 22 state-of-the-art methods. We hope to help link together biomedical research and artificial intelligence and to assist the diagnosis of doctors, radiologists, and inspectors at each epidemic prevention site in the real world.

AB In the recent past, deep learning methods have demonstrated remarkable success for supervised learning tasks in multiple domains including computer vision, natural language processing, and speech processing. In this article, we investigate the impact of deep learning in the field of biometrics, given its success in other domains. Since biometrics deals with identifying people by using their characteristics, it primarily involves supervised learning and can leverage the success of deep learning in other related domains. In this article, we survey 100 different approaches that explore deep learning for recognizing individuals using various biometric modalities. We find that most deep learning research in biometrics has been focused on face and speaker recognition. Based on inferences from these approaches, we discuss how deep learning methods can benefit the field of biometrics and the potential gaps that deep learning approaches need to address for real-world biometric applications.

AB As instruction shifts away from traditional approaches, online learning has grown in popularity in K-12 and higher education. Artificial intelligence (AI) and learning analytics methods such as machine learning have been used by educational scholars to support online learners on a large scale. However, the fairness of AI prediction in educational contexts has received insufficient attention, which can increase educational inequality. This study aims to fill this gap by proposing a fair logistic regression (Fair-LR) algorithm. Specifically, we developed Fair-LR and compared it with fairness-unaware AI models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest). We evaluated fairness with equalized odds that caters to statistical type I and II errors in predictions across demographic subgroups. The results showed that the Fair-LR could generate desirable predictive accuracy while achieving better fairness. The findings implied that the educational community could adopt a methodological shift to achieve accurate and fair AI to support learning and reduce bias.

AB This work concerns the laser wire directed energy deposition (LW-DED) additive manufacturing process. The objectives were two-fold: (1) process mapping - demarcating the process states as a function of the processing parameters; and (2) process monitoring - detecting process anomalies (instabilities) using data acquired from an in-situ meltpool imaging sensor. The LW-DED process enables high-throughput, near-net shape manufacturing. Without rigorous parameter control, however, LW-DED often introduces defects due to stochastic process drifts. To enhance scalability and reliability, it is essential to understand how LW-DED parameters affect processing regimes, and detect deleterious process drifts. In this work, single-track experiments were conducted over 128 combinations of laser power, scanning velocity, and linear mass density. Four process states were observed via high-speed imaging and delineated as stable, dripping, stubbing, and incomplete melting regimes. Physically intuitive meltpool features were used to train simple machine learning models for classifying the process state into one of the four regimes. The approach was benchmarked against computationally intense, black-box deep machine learning models that directly use as-received meltpool images. Using only six intuitive meltpool morphology and intensity signatures, the approach classified the LW-DED process state with statistical fidelity approaching 90 % (F1-score) compared to F1-score 87 % for deep learning models.

AB Electric vertical-takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, known for their maneuverability and flexibility, offer a promising alternative to traditional transportation systems. However, these aircraft face significant challenges from various perspectives, including the need to increase energy efficiency, enhance passenger experience, and mitigate noise impact on urban environments. While mathematical modeling-based approaches have been employed for flight motion planning, they often struggle to adapt to dynamic and complex environments. In this work, we introduce a three-dimensional motion planning method based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), tailored for manned eVTOL flights through urban wind fields. Our approach considers three crucial aspects: aircraft energy consumption, passenger experience, and noise impact on urban environment. We modify the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm and design comprehensive reward function that considers these objectives. By incorporating energy efficiency, passenger experience, and noise impact into our reward function, our method demonstrates improved policy learning compared to existing approaches. Comparative experiments conducted under various wind conditions show that our method outperforms commonly used techniques, effectively optimizing multiple objectives in challenging urban environments. Code of our work are available at https://github.com/cgchrfchscyrh/eVTOL_RL/tree/main.

AB The relationship between quantizability and learning complexity in multilayer neural networks is examined. In a special neural network architecture that calculates node activations according to the certainty factor (CF) model of expert systems, the analysis based upon quantizability leads to lower and also better estimates for generalization dimensionality and sample complexity than those suggested by the multilayer perceptron model. This analysis is further supported by empirical simulation results.

ID INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY; FUTURE
AB Given that artificial intelligence and machine learning is now a reality of modern existence, rapidly being applied to medicine, and especially radiology, we submit a new educational perspective. By codifying technology education during the diagnostic radiology internship, we believe it is not only possible but necessary, to reframe the identity of diagnostic radiology. This paper describes the restructuring of the radiology clinical internship, limiting clinical rotations to high-yield essentials, thereby allowing for the introduction of data and technology science, and comprehensive medical physics training. By linking modality-immersion based training with the physics of each technology, we postulate a more thorough understanding and, ultimately, the mastery of current and future technological innovations. Concurrently we advocate for the study of artificial intelligence and machine learning in order to understand how radiologists can apply this technology to help patients on the precision and population health levels. This training would allow interns to spend the majority of their time under the umbrella of a radiology department, in lieu of multiple rotations on an assortment of clinical services. An in-depth technology and physics exam at the end of the internship would be a natural transition to the start of the R1 year, allowing for the application of this newly attained knowledge throughout their residency. Diagnostic radiologists have led medicine into the digital era, and now we should lead the medical community into this transformational era as the "Data-Driven Physician" of the 21st century.

AB Existing malware detectors on safety-critical devices have difficulties in runtime detection due to the performance overhead. In this article, we introduce Propedeutica, a framework for efficient and effective real-time malware detection, leveraging the best of conventional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. In Propedeutica, all software start executions are considered as benign and monitored by a conventional ML classifier for fast detection. If the software receives a borderline classification from the ML detector (e.g., the software is 50% likely to be benign and 50% likely to be malicious), the software will be transferred to a more accurate, yet performance demanding DL detector. To address spatial-temporal dynamics and software execution heterogeneity, we introduce a novel DL architecture (DeepMalware) for Propedeutica with multistream inputs. We evaluated Propedeutica with 9115 malware samples and 1338 benign software from various categories for the Windows OS. With a borderline interval of [30%, 70%], Propedeutica achieves an accuracy of 94.34% and a false-positive rate of 8.75%, with 41.45% of the samples moved for DeepMalware analysis. Even using only CPU, Propedeutica can detect malware within less than 0.1 s.

ID DISEASE DETECTION
AB Plant disease classification is quite complex and, in most cases, requires trained plant pathologists and sophisticated labs to accurately determine the cause. Our group for the first time used microscopic images (x30) of tomato plant diseases, for which representative plant samples were diagnostically validated to classify disease symptoms using non-coding deep learning platforms (NCDL). The mean F1 scores (SD) of the NCDL platforms were 98.5 (1.6) for Amazon Rekognition Custom Label, 93.9 (2.5) for Clarifai, 91.6 (3.9) for Teachable Machine, 95.0 (1.9) for Google AutoML Vision, and 97.5 (2.7) for Microsoft Azure Custom Vision. The accuracy of the NCDL platform for Amazon Rekognition Custom Label was 99.8% (0.2), for Clarifai 98.7% (0.5), for Teachable Machine 98.3% (0.4), for Google AutoML Vision 98.9% (0.6), and for Apple CreateML 87.3 (4.3). Upon external validation, the model's accuracy of the tested NCDL platforms dropped no more than 7%. The potential future use for these models includes the development of mobile- and web-based applications for the classification of plant diseases and integration with a disease management advisory system. The NCDL models also have the potential to improve the early triage of symptomatic plant samples into classes that may save time in diagnostic lab sample processing.

ID YIELD RELATIONSHIPS; WEIGHT
AB Apple (Malus domestica) fruit size plays an integral role in orchard management decision -making, particularly during chemical thinning, fruit quality assessment, and yield pre-diction. A machine vision system was developed using stereo cameras synchronised to a custom-built LED strobe to perform on-tree sizing of fruit in images with high measure-ment accuracy. Two deep neural network models (Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN) were trained to detect fruit candidates for sizing followed by extrapolation of occluded fruit regions to improve size estimation. The segmented fruit shapes were converted to metric surface areas and diameters using spatial resolutions and depth information from the stereo cameras. Monthly field trials from June to October using the camera system were conducted, measuring fruit diameters ranging from 22 to 82 mm, and compared against ground truth diameters. Diameter estimates had a mean absolute error ranging from 1.1 to 4.2 mm for the five-month trial period, an average error of 4.8% compared to ground truth diameter measurements. Standard deviation errors ranged from 0.7 to 1.9 mm. Using neural network models for intelligent sampling of fruit in images followed by extrapolation of missing regions can be an alternative method of handling fruit occlusion in agricultural imaging and improving sizing accuracy.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB Photo-identification of individual snow leopards (Panthera uncia) is the primary data source for density estimation via capture-recapture statistical methods. To identify individual snow leopards in camera trap imagery, it is necessary to match individuals from a large number of images from multiple cameras and historical catalogues, which is both time-consuming and costly. The camouflaged snow leopards also make it difficult for machine learning to classify photos, as they blend in so well with the surrounding mountain environment, rendering applicable software solutions unavailable for the species. To potentially make snow leopard individual identification available via an artificial intelligence (AI) software interface, we first trained and evaluated image classification techniques for a convolutional neural network, pose invariant embeddings (PIE) (a triplet loss network), and compared the accuracy of PIE to that of the HotSpotter algorithm (a SIFT-based algorithm). Data were acquired from a curated library of free-ranging snow leopards taken in Afghanistan between 2012 and 2019 and from captive animals in zoos in Finland, Sweden, Germany, and the United States. We discovered several flaws in the initial PIE model, such as a small amount of background matching, that was addressed, albeit likely not fixed, using background subtraction (BGS) and left-right mirroring (LR) techniques which demonstrated reasonable accuracy (Rank 1: 74% Rank-5: 92%) comparable to the Hotspotter results (Rank 1: 74% Rank 2: 84%)The PIE BGS LR model, in conjunction with Hotspotter, yielded the following results: Rank-1: 85%, Rank-5: 95%, Rank-20: 99%. In general, our findings indicate that PIE BGS LR, in conjunction with HotSpotter, can classify snow leopards more accurately than using either algorithm alone.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is a thriving research field with many successful applications in areas such as computer vision and speech recognition. Machine learning methods, such as artificial neural networks (ANN), play a central role in modern AI technology. While ANN also holds great promise for human genetic research, the high-dimensional genetic data and complex genetic structure bring tremendous challenges. The vast majority of genetic variants on the genome have small or no effects on diseases, and fitting ANN on a large number of variants without considering the underlying genetic structure (e.g., linkage disequilibrium) could bring a serious overfitting issue. Furthermore, while a single disease phenotype is often studied in a classic genetic study, in emerging research fields (e.g., imaging genetics), researchers need to deal with different types of disease phenotypes. To address these challenges, we propose a functional neural networks (FNN) method. FNN uses a series of basis functions to model high-dimensional genetic data and a variety of phenotype data and further builds a multi-layer functional neural network to capture the complex relationships between genetic variants and disease phenotypes. Through simulations, we demonstrate the advantages of FNN for high-dimensional genetic data analysis in terms of robustness and accuracy. The real data applications also showed that FNN attained higher accuracy than the existing methods.

AB Comprehensive hardware assurance approaches guaranteeing trust on Integrated Circuits (ICs) typically require the verification of the IC design layout and functionality through destructive Reverse Engineering (RE). It is a resource intensive process that will benefit greatly from the extensive integration of data-driven paradigms, especially in the imaging and image analysis phase. Although obvious, this uptake of data-driven approaches into RE-assisted hardware assurance is lagging due to the lack of massive amounts of high-quality labelled data. In this paper, a large-scale synthetic Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) dataset, REFICS, is introduced to address this issue. The dataset, the first open-source dataset in the RE community, consists of 800,000 SEM images over two node technologies, 32nm and 90nm, and four cardinal layers of the IC, namely, doping, polysilicon, contact and metal layers. Furthermore, a framework, based on uncertainty and risk, is introduced to compare the efficacy and benefits of existing RE workflows utilizing ad-hoc steps in its execution. These developments are critical in developing RE-assisted hardware assurance into a scalable, automated and fault-tolerant approach. Finally, the work is concluded with the performance analysis of existing machine learning and deep learning approaches for image analysis in RE and hardware assurance.

AB This paper presents a robust system for mitigating adversarial and natural GPS disruptions by presenting: (1) a software-based defense mechanism against spoofing attacks using generative adversarial networks (GANs), The system detects unauthorized or spoofed GPS signals from a hardware based spoofer, and (2) deep neural network models to infer positioning information in GPS-degraded /denied environments using the novel idea of GPS satellite constellation fingerprint. As the GAN and Satellite constellation fingerprinting are used together in a unified framework, we call it the "GANSAT positioning system." Intuitively, the GANSAT neural networks implicitly learn a representation of the aggregation of the hardware fingerprints of the satellite's in the GPS constellation at a given location and time. To demonstrate the approach, raw GPS signals were collected from the satellite transmitters using a software defined radio (SDR) at five different locations in the Florida panhandle area of the United States. Additionally, a GPS spoofer is implemented using a SDR and an open source software and used in an uncontrolled laboratory environment for spoofing the GPS signals at the aforementioned locations. In our experiments, the GANSAT framework yields similar to 99.5% accuracy for the task of identifying and filtering the spoofed GPS signals from real ones. It also achieves similar to 100% accuracy for the task of location estimation.

AB Accurately forecasting ridesourcing demand is important for effective transportation planning and policy making. With the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), researchers have started to utilize machine learning models to forecast travel demand, which, in many cases, can produce higher prediction accuracy than statistical models. However, most existing machine-learning studies used a global model to predict the demand and ignored the influence of spatial heterogeneity (i.e., the spatial variations in the impacts of explanatory variables). Spatial heterogeneity can drive the parameter estimations varying over space; failing to consider the spatial variations may limit the model's prediction performance. To account for spatial heterogeneity, this study proposes a Clustering-aided Ensemble Method (CEM) to forecast the zone-to-zone (census-tract-to-census-tract) travel demand for ridesourcing services. Specifically, we develop an interactive clustering approach (powered by human in-the-loop AI) to split the origin-destination pairs into different clusters and ensemble the cluster-specific machine learning models for prediction. We implement and test the proposed methodology by using the ridesourcing-trip data in Chicago. The results show that, with a more transparent and flexible model structure, the CEM significantly improves the prediction accuracy than the benchmark models (i.e., global machine learning and statistical models directly trained on all observations). This study offers transportation researchers and practitioners a new methodology of travel demand forecasting, especially for new travel modes like ridesourcing and micromobility.

AB Targeted spraying application technologies have the capacity to drastically reduce herbicide inputs, but to be successful, the performance of both machine vision-based weed detection and actuator efficiency needs to be optimized. This study assessed (1) the performance of spotted spurge recognition in 'Latitude 36' bermudagrass turf canopy using the You Only Look Once (YOLOv3) real-time multiobject detection algorithm and (2) the impact of various nozzle densities on model efficiency and projected herbicide reduction under simulated conditions. The YOLOv3 model was trained and validated with a data set of 1,191 images. The simulation design consisted of four grid matrix regimes (3 x 3, 6 x 6, 12 x 12, and 24 x 24), which would then correspond to 3, 6, 12, and 24 nonoverlapping nozzles, respectively, covering a 50-cm-wide band. Simulated efficiency testing was conducted using 50 images containing predictions (labels) generated with the trained YOLO model and by applying each of the grid matrixes to individual images. The model resulted in prediction accuracy of an F1 score of 0.62, precision of 0.65, and a recall value of 0.60. Increased nozzle density (from 3 to 12) improved actuator precision and predicted herbicide-use efficiency with a reduction in the false hits ratio from similar to 30% to 5%. The area required to ensure herbicide deposition to all spotted spurge detected within images was reduced to 18%, resulting in similar to 80% herbicide savings compared to broadcast application. Slightly greater precision was predicted with 24 nozzles but was not statistically different from the 12-nozzle scenario. Using this turf/weed model as a basis, optimal actuator efficacy and herbicide savings would occur by increasing nozzle density from 1 to 12 nozzles within the context of a single band.

AB Climate change and rapid urban development have intensified the impact of hurricanes, especially on the Southeastern Coasts of the United States. Localized and timely risk assessments can facilitate coastal communities' preparedness and response to imminent hurricanes. Existing assessment methods focused on hurricane risks at large spatial scales, which were not specific or could not provide actionable knowledge for residents or property owners. Fragility functions and other widely utilized assessment methods cannot model the complex relationships between building features and hurricane risk levels effectively. Therefore, we develop and test a building-level hurricane risk assessment with deep feedforward neural network (DFNN) models. The input features of DFNN models cover the meta building characteristics, fine-grained meteorological, and hydrological environmental parameters. The assessment outcomes, that is, risk levels, include the probability and intensity of building/property damages induced by wind and surge hazards. We interpret the DFNN models with local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME). We apply the DFNN models to a case building in Cameron County, Louisiana in response to a hypothetical imminent hurricane to illustrate how the building's risk levels can be timely assessed with the updating weather forecast. This research shows the potential of deep-learning models in integrating multi-sourced features and accurately predicting buildings' risks of weather extremes for property owners and households. The AI-powered risk assessment model can help coastal populations form appropriate and updating perceptions of imminent hurricanes and inform actionable knowledge for proactive risk mitigation and long-term climate adaptation.

ID LIMITATIONS
AB Premise High-resolution cameras are very helpful for plant phenotyping as their images enable tasks such as target vs. background discrimination and the measurement and analysis of fine above-ground plant attributes. However, the acquisition of high-resolution images of plant roots is more challenging than above-ground data collection. An effective super-resolution (SR) algorithm is therefore needed for overcoming the resolution limitations of sensors, reducing storage space requirements, and boosting the performance of subsequent analyses. Methods We propose an SR framework for enhancing images of plant roots using convolutional neural networks. We compare three alternatives for training the SR model: (i) training with non-plant-root images, (ii) training with plant-root images, and (iii) pretraining the model with non-plant-root images and fine-tuning with plant-root images. The architectures of the SR models were based on two state-of-the-art deep learning approaches: a fast SR convolutional neural network and an SR generative adversarial network. Results In our experiments, we observed that the SR models improved the quality of low-resolution images of plant roots in an unseen data set in terms of the signal-to-noise ratio. We used a collection of publicly available data sets to demonstrate that the SR models outperform the basic bicubic interpolation, even when trained with non-root data sets. Discussion The incorporation of a deep learning-based SR model in the imaging process enhances the quality of low-resolution images of plant roots. We demonstrate that SR preprocessing boosts the performance of a machine learning system trained to separate plant roots from their background. Our segmentation experiments also show that high performance on this task can be achieved independently of the signal-to-noise ratio. We therefore conclude that the quality of the image enhancement depends on the desired application.

AB Plant pathology has developed a wide range of concepts and tools for improving plant disease management, including models for understanding and responding to new risks from climate change. Most of these tools can be improved using new advances in artificial intelligence (AI), such as machine learning to integrate massive data sets in predictive models. There is the potential to develop automated analyses of risk that alert decision-makers, from farm managers to national plant protection organizations, to the likely need for action and provide decision support for targeting responses.We review machine-learning applications in plant pathology and synthesize ideas for the next steps to make the most of these tools in digital agriculture. Global projects, such as the proposed global surveillance system for plant disease, will be strengthened by the integration of the wide range of new data, including data from tools like remote sensors, that are used to evaluate the risk of plant disease. There is exciting potential for the use of AI to strengthen global capacity building as well, from image analysis for disease diagnostics and associated management recommendations on farmers' phones to future training methodologies for plant pathologists that are customized in real-time for management needs in response to the current risks. International cooperation in integrating data and models will help develop the most effective responses to new challenges from climate change.

AB We introduce a hybrid quantum-classical vision transformer architecture, notable for its integration of variational quantum circuits within both the attention mechanism and the multi-layer perceptrons. The research addresses the critical challenge of computational efficiency and resource constraints in analyzing data from the upcoming High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider, presenting the architecture as a potential solution. In particular, we evaluate our method by applying the model to multi-detector jet images from CMS Open Data. The goal is to distinguish quark-initiated from gluon-initiated jets. We successfully train the quantum model and evaluate it via numerical simulations. Using this approach, we achieve classification performance almost on par with the one obtained with the completely classical architecture, considering a similar number of parameters.

AB Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) represents a highly-prevalent complication of diabetes in which individuals suffer from damage to the blood vessels in the retina. The disease manifests itself through lesion presence, starting with microaneurysms, at the nonproliferative stage before being characterized by neovascularization in the proliferative stage. Retinal specialists strive to detect DR early so that the disease can be treated before substantial, irreversible vision loss occurs. The level of DR severity indicates the extent of treatment necessary - vision loss may be preventable by effective diabetes management in mild (early) stages, rather than subjecting the patient to invasive laser surgery. Using artificial intelligence (AI), highly accurate and efficient systems can be developed to help assist medical professionals in screening and diagnosing DR earlier and without the full resources that are available in specialty clinics. In particular, deep learning facilitates diagnosis earlier and with higher sensitivity and specificity. Such systems make decisions based on minimally handcrafted features and pave the way for personalized therapies. Thus, this survey provides a comprehensive description of the current technology used in each step of DR diagnosis. First, it begins with an introduction to the disease and the current technologies and resources available in this space. It proceeds to discuss the frameworks that different teams have used to detect and classify DR. Ultimately, we conclude that deep learning systems offer revolutionary potential to DR identification and prevention of vision loss. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID PREDICTION
AB Soil spectroscopy has emerged as a key technique for rapid, non-destructive soil property prediction, yet the centralized nature of the training of machine learning models raises concerns around data privacy, accessibility, and transferability. This study proposes the application of Federated Learning (FL) as a decentralized approach to soil spectroscopy, enabling collaboration between multiple data contributors (or clients) without requiring the exchange of raw data. Convolutional neural networks were used to estimate key soil attributes such as soil organic carbon, texture, pH, cation exchange, and total nitrogen using VNIR or MIR spectral data from the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory. Three data partitioning approaches were explored involving geopolitical, bioclimatic, independent, and identically distributed (IID) splitting methods to simulate various real-world scenarios of particular interest to the soil community. Each scenario was investigated under two different averaging aggregation strategies: Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and Weighted Averaging (WgtAvg), which are used to develop a consensus model by aggregating the weights of the different contributors. The results show that the FL framework can match, and in some cases exceed, the performance of centralized models, particularly when using IID data. The WgtAvg strategy was particularly effective in boosting prediction accuracy even by 50 % for soil properties where contributors had unequal data sizes. This study highlights the potential of FL as a privacy-preserving framework across networks of soil labs, facilitating enhanced soil health monitoring with decentralized global models.

AB BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) has become an increasingly prominent tool in the field of neurosurgery, revolutionizing various aspects of patient care and surgical practices. AI-powered systems can provide real-time feedback to surgeons, enhancing precision and reducing the risk of complications during surgical procedures. The objective of this study is to review the role of AI in training neurosurgical residents, improving accuracy during surgery, and reducing complications. METHODS: The literature search method involved searching PubMed using relevant keywords to identify English literature publications, including full texts, and concerning human subject matter from its inception until May 2024, initially generating 247,747 results. Articles were then screened for topic relevancy by abstract contents. Further articles were retrieved from the sources cited by the initially reviewed articles. A comprehensive review was then performed on various studies, including observational studies, case-control studies, cohort studies, clinical trials, meta-analyses, and reviews by 4 reviewers individually and then collectively. RESULTS: Studies on AI in neurosurgery reach more than 4000 produced over a decade alone. The majority of studies regarding clinical diagnosis, risk prediction, and intraoperative guidance remain retrospective in nature. In its current form, AI-based paradigm performed inferiorly to neurosurgery residents in test taking. CONCLUSIONS: AI has potential for broad applications in neurosurgery from use as a diagnostic, predictive, intraoperative, or educational tool. Further research is warranted for prospective use of AI-based technology for delivery of neurosurgical care.

ID ANOMALY DETECTION; FAILURE ANALYSIS
AB Reliability and stability have been treated as the major requirements for the Business Support System (BSS) in telecommunications networks. It is crucial and essential for service providers to maintain good operating state of the BSS. In this article, we aim at system error prediction for a BSS, i.e., we predict occurrences of the abnormal state or behavior of the BSS. Because the occurrences of system errors are rare events in the BSS (i.e., the dataset of system status is highly imbalanced), it is highly challenging to use machine learning or deep learning algorithms to predict system error for the BSS. To address this challenge, we propose a machine learning-based framework for the system error prediction and a Frequency-based Feature Creation (FFC) algorithm to create new features to improve prediction. By adding the time-series information created by the existing features, the proposed FFC can amplify the effects of important features. Our experimental results show that the FFC significantly improves the prediction performance for the Random Forest algorithm.

AB In the realm of biological image analysis, deep learning (DL) has become a core toolkit, for example for segmentation and classification. However, conventional DL methods are challenged by large biodiversity datasets characterized by unbalanced classes and hard-to-distinguish phenotypic differences between them. Here we present BioEncoder, a user-friendly toolkit for metric learning, which overcomes these challenges by focussing on learning relationships between individual data points rather than on the separability of classes. BioEncoder is released as a Python package, created for ease of use and flexibility across diverse datasets. It features taxon-agnostic data loaders, custom augmentation options, and simple hyperparameter adjustments through text-based configuration files. The toolkit's significance lies in its potential to unlock new research avenues in biological image analysis while democratizing access to advanced deep metric learning techniques. BioEncoder focuses on the urgent need for toolkits bridging the gap between complex DL pipelines and practical applications in biological research.

AB Background: The prediction of posttransplant health outcomes for pediatric heart transplantation is critical for risk stratification and high-quality posttransplant care. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the use of machine learning (ML) models to predict rejection and mortality for pediatric heart transplant recipients. Methods: Various ML models were used to predict rejection and mortality at 1, 3, and 5 years after transplantation in pediatric heart transplant recipients using United Network for Organ Sharing data from 1987 to 2019. The variables used for predicting posttransplant outcomes included donor and recipient as well as medical and social factors. We evaluated 7 ML models-extreme multilayer perceptron, and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost)-as well as a deep learning model with 2 hidden layers with 100 neurons and a rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function followed by batch normalization for each and a classification head with a softmax activation function. We used 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance. Shapley additive explanations Results: RF and AdaBoost models were the best-performing algorithms for different prediction windows across outcomes. RF outperformed other ML algorithms in predicting 5 of the 6 outcomes (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] 0.664 and 0.706 for 1-year and 3-year rejection, respectively, and AUROC 0.697, 0.758, and 0.763 for 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year mortality, respectively). AdaBoost achieved the best performance for prediction of 5-year rejection (AUROC 0.705). Conclusions: This study demonstrates the comparative utility of ML approaches for modeling posttransplant health outcomes using registry data. ML approaches can identify unique risk factors and their complex relationship with outcomes, thereby identifying patients considered to be at risk and informing the transplant community about the potential of these innovative approaches to improve pediatric care after heart transplantation. Future studies are required to translate the information derived from prediction models to optimize counseling, clinical care, and decision-making within pediatric organ transplant centers.

AB Personalization security is a concern with the rising ability to monitor and access public and personal data by organizations, mainly with gradual integration of human life with their devices. In this paper we have shown how simple browsing log data can jeopardize the identity and the personal integrity of a person along with analysis of preventive measures to protect them. As people get digitally enslaved, unknowingly browsing logs inherited certain unique behaviors of the people. It can be characterized and used for monitoring them and their aligned social, professional and organizational counterparts. It is quite a challenge for modern systems to keep attackers at bay and prevent them from gathering and analyzing activity data which can be used to identify specific, easy and valuable targets. Our analysis is based on modeling efficient systems for justification of the possible vulnerabilities and counter-measures through data driven approaches to learn and analyze such data and derive the extent these data can be exploited. Overall, we achieved an accuracy of 85% for identification of targeted characteristics using log data features using deep learning models, which achieved better than other learning models, thus effectively pointing out to the fact that there is severe non-linearity and combination possibilities in the data.

AB BackgroundThe principles of urgency, utility, and benefit are fundamental concepts guiding the ethical and practical decision-making process for organ allocation; however, LT allocation still follows an urgency model.AimTo identify and analyze data elements used in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods, data sources, and their focus on urgency, utility, or benefit in LT.MethodsA comprehensive search across Ovid Medline and Scopus was conducted for studies published from 2002 to June 2023. Inclusion criteria targeted quantitative studies using ML/AI for candidates, donors, or recipients. Two reviewers assessed eligibility and extracted data, following PRISMA guidelines.ResultsA total of 20 papers were included, synthesizing results into five major categories. Eight studies were led by a Spanish team, focusing on donor-recipient matching and proposing machine learning models to predict post- LT survival. Other international studies addressed organ supply-demand issues and developed predictive models to optimize LT outcomes. The studies highlight the potential of ML/AI to enhance LT allocation and outcomes. Despite advancements, limitations included the lack of robust transplant-related benefit models and improvements in urgency models compared to MELD.DiscussionThis review highlighted the potential of AI and ML to enhance liver transplant allocation and outcomes. Significant advancements were noted, but limitations such as the need for better urgency models and the absence of a transplant-related benefit model remain. Most studies emphasized utility, focusing on survival outcomes. Future research should address the interpretability and generalizability of these models to improve organ allocation and post-LT survival predictions.

AB While image captioning through machines requires structured learning and basis for interpretation, improvement requires multiple context understanding and processing in a meaningful way. This research provides a novel concept for context combination and impacts many applications to deal with visual features as an equivalence of descriptions of objects, activities, and events. There are three components of our architecture: Feature Distribution Composition (FDC) Layer Attention, Multiple Role Representation Crossover (MRRC) Attention Layer, and the Language Decoder. FDC Layer Attention helps in generating the weighted attention from RCNN features, MRRC Attention Layer acts as intermediate representation processing and helps in generating the next word attention. A Language Decoder helps in the estimation of the likelihood for the next probable word in the sentence. We demonstrated the effectiveness of FDC, MRRC, regional object feature attention, and reinforcement learning for effective learning to generate better captions from images. The performance of our model enhanced previous performances to 35.3% and created a new standard and theory for representation generation based on logic, better interpretability, and contexts.

AB The main idea of Less is more approach (LIMA) is using as fewer as possible ingredients to provide the best possible outcome. This approach has been used successfully almost in all the scientific and art disciplines. Recently, the idea has also been successfully explored in solving hard optimization problems. In this note we first define the dominance relation between two algorithms that includes their simplicity as well. Then we propose the general LIMA algorithm and discuss automatic ways to include common ingredients of all search algorithms, increasing the algorithms complexity in a systematic way. That kind of approach may represent a road from Optimization to Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning. Finally, we illustrate LIMA algorithm on two optimization problems and show its efficiency.

AB Accurate prediction and monitoring of patient health in the intensive care unit can inform shared decisions regarding appropriateness of care delivery, risk-reduction strategies, and intensive care resource use. Traditionally, algorithmic solutions for patient outcome prediction rely solely on data available from electronic health records (EHR). In this pilot study, we explore the benefits of augmenting existing EHR data with novel measurements from wrist-worn activity sensors as part of a clinical environment known as the Intelligent ICU. We implemented temporal deep learning models based on two distinct sources of patient data: (1) routinely measured vital signs from electronic health records, and (2) activity data collected from wearable sensors. As a proxy for illness severity, our models predicted whether patients leaving the intensive care unit would be successfully or unsuccessfully discharged from the hospital. We overcome the challenge of small sample size in our prospective cohort by applying deep transfer learning using EHR data from a much larger cohort of traditional ICU patients. Our experiments quantify added utility of non-traditional measurements for predicting patient health, especially when applying a transfer learning procedure to small novel Intelligent ICU cohorts of critically ill patients.

AB Importance Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine hesitancy or refusal is common among parents of adolescents. An understanding of public perceptions from the perspective of behavior change theories can facilitate effective and targeted vaccine promotion strategies. Objective To develop and validate deep learning models for understanding public perceptions of HPV vaccines from the perspective of behavior change theories using data from social media. Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective cohort study, conducted from April to August 2019, included longitudinal and geographic analyses of public perceptions regarding HPV vaccines, using sampled HPV vaccine-related Twitter discussions collected from January 2014 to October 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures The prevalence of social media discussions related to the construct of health belief model (HBM) and theory of planned behavior (TPB), categorized by deep learning algorithms. Locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) revealed trends of constructs. Social media users' US state-level home location information was extracted from their profiles, and geographic analyses were performed to identify the clustering of public perceptions of the HPV vaccine. Results A total of 1431463 English-language posts from 486116 unique usernames were collected. Deep learning algorithms achieved F-1 scores ranging from 0.6805 (95% CI, 0.6516-0.7094) to 0.9421 (95% CI, 0.9380-0.9462) in mapping discussions to the constructs of behavior change theories. LOESS revealed trends in constructs; for example, prevalence of perceived barriers, a construct of HBM, deceased from its apex in July 2015 (56.2%) to its lowest prevalence in October 2018 (28.4%; difference, 27.8%; P < .001); Positive attitudes toward the HPV vaccine, a construct of TPB, increased from early 2017 (30.7%) to 41.9% at the end of the study (difference, 11.2%; P < .001), while negative attitudes decreased from 42.3% to 31.3% (difference, 11.0%; P < .001) during the same period. Interstate variations in public perceptions of the HPV vaccine were also identified; for example, the states of Ohio and Maine showed a relatively high prevalence of perceived barriers (11531 of 17106 [67.4%] and 1157 of 1684 [68.7%]) and negative attitudes (9655 of 17197 [56.1%] and 1080 of 1793 [60.2%]). Conclusions and Relevance This cohort study provided a good understanding of public perceptions on social media and evolving trends in terms of multiple dimensions. The interstate variations of public perceptions could be associated with the rise of local antivaccine sentiment. The methods described in this study represent an early contribution to using existing empirically and theoretically based frameworks that describe human decision-making in conjunction with more intelligent deep learning algorithms. Furthermore, these data demonstrate the ability to collect large-scale HPV vaccine perception and intention data that can inform public health communication and education programs designed to improve immunization rates at the community, state, or even national level.
   Question Can public perceptions of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine be accessed from the perspective of behavior change theories by mining social media data with machine learning algorithms? Findings This cohort study included 1431463 English-language posts about the HPV vaccine from 486116 unique usernames from a social media platform. An increase in HPV vaccine-related discussions was found, and the results suggest temporal and geographic variations in public perceptions of the HPV vaccine. Meaning The findings of this study suggest that social media and machine learning algorithms can serve as a complementary approach to inform public health surveillance and understanding and help to design targeted educational and communication programs that increase HPV vaccine acceptance.
   This cohort study develops and validates deep learning models to understand public perceptions of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines from the perspective of behavior change theories using data from social media.

AB Public participation is vital to achieving successful plan outcomes, whereas meaningful participation requires at least informing and consulting the public. However, collecting frequent feedback from the public is a labour-intensive process. Information technologies like Google Maps Reviews offer to collect extensive public inputs by allowing users to share their feedback and ratings about services. Machine learning methods are ideal for analyzing these reviews to understand users' experiences. This study proposes a machine learning application using Google Maps Reviews to examine feedback on the selected parks in Istanbul, Turkiye. Reviews provide insights into not only park features but also its social structure. The introduced method supports surveys and interview methods preferred by planners.

AB The convolutional neural network-based deep generative model (DGM) is a powerful tool for handling image datasets that opens up strategies for fast synthesis of optimum designs at unseen boundary conditions. Existing DGMs for design synthesis are typically based on O (10000) training data, which limits the engineering applications. This paper explores the feasibility of improving DGM data efficiency with O (100) training data through prior constraints. A two-stage data-efficient deep generative model (DE-DGM) is proposed which leverages the first-stage design synthesis from probabilistic proper orthogonal decomposition and the second-stage enhancement from encoder-decoder convolutional neural network. Four topology optimization cases have been adopted, including compliance minimization, heat conduction, airplane bearing bracket design, and three-dimensional machine tool column structure design. The proposed DE-DGMs could be trained with 100-200 data and synthesize the main features of the design at unseen boundary conditions. The overall computation cost of warm-start topology optimization leveraging DE-DGM predictions reduces to 36 %-58 % of the standard cases.

AB This study investigates how online users from domestic and international audiences authenticate social media influencers (SMIs) that contribute to building a destination's organic image through creative content about the destination's culture, traditions, heritage, and the life of its ordinary people. The context of the study is a popular Chinese influencer, Li Ziqi, whose videography depicts domestic, day-to-day life in rural areas of the Sichuan province of China. We use an approach that combines the Large Language Model (LLM) prompt engineering with theoretically guided human interpretations of authentication aspects such as genuineness, otherizing, traditionalizing, nostalgia, and existential authenticity. We obtained evidence that authentication through otherizing and existential authenticity, specifically self-reflection and self-discovery, is more prevalent among international followers, while domestic viewers use traditionalizing and nostalgia more. Destination Marketing Organizations (DMOs) can potentially leverage those differences in perceptions in their marketing communications with respective audiences.

TI Deep anomaly detection in packet payload

DT Article
DE Packet payload; Anomaly detection; Block sequence; Deep learning
AB With the wide deployment of edge devices, a variety of emerging applications have been deployed at the edge of network. To guarantee the safe and efficient operations of the edge applications, especially the extensive web applications, it is important and challenging to detect packet payload anomalies, which can be expressed as a number of specific strings that may cause attacks. Although some approaches have achieved remarkable progress, they are with limited applications since these approaches are dependent on in-depth expert knowledge, e.g., signatures describing anomalies or communication protocol at the application level. Moreover, they might fail to detect the payload anomalies that may have long-term dependency relationships at the edge of network. To overcome these limitations and adaptively detect anomalies from packet payloads, we propose a deep learning based framework which does not rely on any in-depth expert knowledge and is capable of detecting anomalies that have long-term dependency relationships. The proposed framework consists of two parts. First, a novel block sequence construction method is proposed to obtain a valid expression of a payload. The block sequence could encapsulate both the high-dimension information and the underlying sequential information which facilitate the anomaly detection. Secondly, we design a detection model to learn two different dependency relationships within the block sequence, which is based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Multi-head Self Attention Mechanism. Furthermore, we cast the anomaly detection as a classification problem and employ a classifier with attention mechanism to integrate information and detect anomalies. Extensive experimental results on three public datasets indicate that our model could achieve a higher detection rate, while keeping a lower false positive rate compared with two traditional machine learning methods and three state-of-the-art methods.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB Accurate maps of regional surface water features are integral for advancing ecologic, atmospheric and land development studies. The only comprehensive surface water feature map of Alaska is the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). NHD features are often digitized representations of historic topographic map blue lines and may be outdated. Here we test deep learning methods to automatically extract surface water features from airborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (IfSAR) data to update and validate Alaska hydrographic databases. U-net artificial neural networks (ANN) and high-performance computing (HPC) are used for supervised hydrographic feature extraction within a study area comprised of 50 contiguous watersheds in Alaska. Surface water features derived from elevation through automated flow-routing and manual editing are used as training data. Model extensibility is tested with a series of 16 U-net models trained with increasing percentages of the study area, from about 3 to 35 percent. Hydrography is predicted by each of the models for all watersheds not used in training. Input raster layers are derived from digital terrain models, digital surface models, and intensity images from the IfSAR data. Results indicate about 15 percent of the study area is required to optimally train the ANN to extract hydrography when F1-scores for tested watersheds average between 66 and 68. Little benefit is gained by training beyond 15 percent of the study area. Fully connected hydrographic networks are generated for the U-net predictions using a novel approach that constrains a D-8 flow-routing approach to follow U-net predictions. This work demonstrates the ability of deep learning to derive surface water feature maps from complex terrain over a broad area.

   self-supervised learning
ID GENERATION; PREDICTION; KNOWLEDGE
AB Although substantial efforts have been made using graph neural networks (GNNs) for artificial intelligence (AI)-driven drug discovery, effective molecular representation learning remains an open challenge, especially in the case of insufficient labeled molecules. Recent studies suggest that big GNN models pre-trained by self-supervised learning on unlabeled datasets enable better transfer performance in downstream molecular property prediction tasks. However, the approaches in these studies require multiple complex self-supervised tasks and large-scale datasets , which are time-consuming, computationally expensive and difficult to pre-train end-to-end. Here, we design a simple yet effective self-supervised strategy to simultaneously learn local and global information about molecules, and further propose a novel bi-branch masked graph transformer autoencoder (BatmanNet) to learn molecular representations. BatmanNet features two tailored complementary and asymmetric graph autoencoders to reconstruct the missing nodes and edges, respectively, from a masked molecular graph. With this design, BatmanNet can effectively capture the underlying structure and semantic information of molecules, thus improving the performance of molecular representation. BatmanNet achieves state-of-the-art results for multiple drug discovery tasks, including molecular properties prediction, drug-drug interaction and drug-target interaction, on 13 benchmark datasets, demonstrating its great potential and superiority in molecular representation learning.

AB A challenging problem in machine learning is to discover the domain rules from a limited number of instances, In a large complex: domain, it is often the case that the rules learned by the computer are at most approximate. To address this problem, this paper describes the CFNet which bases its activation function on the certainty factor (CF) model of expert systems, a new analysis on the computational complexity of rule learning in general is provided. A further analysis shows how this complexity can be reduced to a point where the domain rules can be accurately learned by capitalizing on the activation function characteristics of the CFNet. The claimed capability is adequately supported by empirical evaluations and comparisons with related systems.

AB Brain-inspired computing hardware aims to emulate the structure and working principles of the brain and could be used to address current limitations in artificial intelligence technologies. However, brain-inspired silicon chips are still limited in their ability to fully mimic brain function as most examples are built on digital electronic principles. Here we report an artificial intelligence hardware approach that uses adaptive reservoir computation of biological neural networks in a brain organoid. In this approach-which is termed Brainoware-computation is performed by sending and receiving information from the brain organoid using a high-density multielectrode array. By applying spatiotemporal electrical stimulation, nonlinear dynamics and fading memory properties are achieved, as well as unsupervised learning from training data by reshaping the organoid functional connectivity. We illustrate the practical potential of this technique by using it for speech recognition and nonlinear equation prediction in a reservoir computing framework.
   A living artificial intelligence hardware approach that uses the adaptive reservoir computation of biological neural networks in a brain organoid can perform tasks such as speech recognition and nonlinear equation prediction.

AB In ensemble methods, multiple base classifiers with different performances are used to increase classification accuracy. This study proposes a novel weighted majority voting ensemble approach to classify red green blue images to identify the bacterial spot, late blight, leaf mold, sectorial leaf spot, target spot, early blight, and healthy tomato leaves. Color, textural, and shape features of the images were extracted to be used as inputs for base classifiers, followed by selecting the effective features using the relief method to increase the prediction performance. Six machine learning methods, that is, support vector machine, decision tree, random forest, k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, and discriminative analysis, were used as base classifiers, which resulted in 89.81%, 79.81%, 91.53%, 85.91%, 44.42%, and 82.84% accuracies, respectively. Then, simple majority and weighted majority voting ensemble methods were utilized to improve disease classification, the accuracies of which were 93.49% and 95.58%, respectively. The performance of the proposed method was compared with that of two well-known deep learning methods, namely GoogLeNet and AlexNet, which exerted poor results. The findings of this study showed that the proposed framework based on weighted majority voting outperformed the base machine learning models in classifying tomato diseases.

AB With the recent success of representation learning methods, which includes deep learning as a special case, there has been considerable interest in developing techniques that incorporate known physical constraints into the learned representation. As one example, in many applications that involve a signal propagating through physical media (e.g., optics, acoustics, fluid dynamics, etc.), it is known that the dynamics of the signal must satisfy constraints imposed by the wave equation. Here we propose a matrix factorization technique that decomposes such signals into a sum of components, where each component is regularized to ensure that it nearly satisfies wave equation constraints. Although our proposed formulation is non-convex, we prove that our model can be efficiently solved to global optimality. Through this line of work we establish theoretical connections between wave-informed learning and filtering theory in signal processing. We further demonstrate the application of this work on modal analysis problems commonly arising in structural diagnostics and prognostics.

AB Recent work has used deep learning to derive symmetry transformations, which preserve conserved quantities, and to obtain the corresponding algebras of generators. In this letter, we extend this technique to derive sparse representations of arbitrary Lie algebras. We show that our method reproduces the canonical (sparse) representations of the generators of the Lorentz group, as well as the U(n) and SU (n) families of Lie groups.

AB This paper presents a deep neural network (DNN) based approach for predicting mean and peak wind pressure coefficients on the surface of a scale model low-rise, gable roof building. Pressure data were collected on the model at multiple prescribed wind directions and terrain roughness. The resultant pressure coefficients quantified from a subset of these directions and terrains were used to train a DNN to predict coefficients for directions and terrains excluded from the training. The approach can leverage a variety of input conditions to predict pressure coefficients with high accuracy, while the prior work has limited flexibility with the number of input variables and yielded lower prediction accuracy. A two-step nested DNN procedure is introduced to improve the prediction of peak coefficients. The optimal correlation coefficients of return predictions were 0.9993 and 0.9964, for mean and peak coefficient prediction, respectively. The concept of super-resolution based on global prediction is also discussed. With a sufficiently large database, the proposed DNN-based approach can augment existing experimental methods to improve the yield of knowledge while reducing the number of tests required to gain that knowledge.

ID EMOTIONS
AB Online discussion forums are highly valued by instructors due to their affordance for understanding class activities and learning. However, a discussion forum with a great number of posts requires a large amount of time to view, and help requests are easily overlooked. Various machine-learning-based tools have been developed to help instructors monitor or identify posts that require immediate responses. However, the black-box nature of deep learning cannot explain why and how decisions are achieved, raising trust and reliability issues. To address the gap, this work developed an explainable text classifier framework based on a model originally designed for legal services. We used the Stanford MOOCPost dataset to identify posts of confusion. Our results showed that the framework can not only identify discussion forum posts with confusion of different levels, but also provide explanation in terms of words from the identified posts.

AB The computational framework of rule-based neural networks inherits from the neural network and the inference engine of an expert system. In one approach, the network activation function is based on the certainty factor (CF) model of MYCIN-like systems, In this paper, it is shown theoretically that the neural network using the CF-based activation function requires relatively small sample sizes for correct generalization. This result is also confirmed by empirical studies in,several independent domains.

AB Simple Summary Lung cancer screening has been shown to help reduce mortality in selected populations of smokers; however, performing screening programs at a larger scale with high accuracy is still a challenge. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) has been investigated to improve large scale screening. We have performed a meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of deep learning (DL) algorithms to diagnose lung cancer. Combining six eligible studies, the pooled sensitivity and specificity of DL algorithms were 0.93 (95% CI 0.85-0.98) and 0.68 (95% CI 0.49-0.84), respectively. Despite remaining challenges in the field, AI is likely to play an important role in disease screening in the future. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic performance of current deep learning algorithms for the diagnosis of lung cancer. We searched major databases up to June 2022 to include studies that used artificial intelligence to diagnose lung cancer, using the histopathological analysis of true positive cases as a reference. The quality of the included studies was assessed independently by two authors based on the revised Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies. Six studies were included in the analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.93 (95% CI 0.85-0.98) and 0.68 (95% CI 0.49-0.84), respectively. Despite the significantly high heterogeneity for sensitivity (I-2 = 94%, p < 0.01) and specificity (I-2 = 99%, p < 0.01), most of it was attributed to the threshold effect. The pooled SROC curve with a bivariate approach yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.90 (95% CI 0.86 to 0.92). The DOR for the studies was 26.7 (95% CI 19.7-36.2) and heterogeneity was 3% (p = 0.40). In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we found that when using the summary point from the SROC, the pooled sensitivity and specificity of DL algorithms for the diagnosis of lung cancer were 93% and 68%, respectively.

ID BLACK SPOT; REFLECTANCE
AB . Citrus black spot (CBS) is a fungal disease caused by Phyllosticta citricarpa that poses a quarantine threat and can restrict market access to fruits. It manifests as lesions on the fruit surface and can result in premature fruit drops, leading to reduced yield. Another significant disease affecting citrus is canker, which is caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (syn. X. axonopodis pv. citri); it causes economic losses for growers due to fruit drops and blemishes. Early detection and management of groves infected with CBS or canker through fruit and leaf inspection can greatly benefit the Florida citrus industry. However, manual inspection and classification of disease symptoms on fruits or leaves are labor-intensive and time-consuming processes. Therefore, there is a need to develop a computer vision system capable of autonomously classifying fruits and leaves, expediting disease management in the groves. This paper aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of convolutional neural network (CNN) generated features and machine learning (ML) classifiers for detecting CBS infected fruits and leaves with canker symptoms. A custom shallow CNN with radial basis function support vector machine (RBF SVM) achieved an overall accuracy of 92.1% for classifying fruits with CBS and four other conditions (greasy spot, melanose, wind scar, and marketable), and a custom Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG16) with the RBF SVM classified leaves with canker and four other conditions (control, greasy spot, melanoses, and scab) at an overall accuracy of 93%. These preliminary findings demonstrate the potential of utilizing hyperspectral imaging (HSI) systems for automated classification of citrus fruit and leaf diseases using shallow and deep CNN-generated features, along with ML classifiers.

AB Machine learning (ML) computational methods for predicting compounds with pharmacological activity, specific pharmacodynamic and ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity) properties are being increasingly applied in drug discovery and evaluation. Recently, machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks, support vector machines and genetic programming have been explored for predicting inhibitors, antagonists, blockers, agonists, activators and substrates of proteins related to specific therapeutic targets. These methods are particularly useful for screening compound libraries of diverse chemical structures, "noisy" and high-dimensional data to complement QSAR methods, and in cases of unavailable receptor 3D structure to complement structure-based methods. A variety of studies have demonstrated the potential of machine-learning methods for predicting compounds as potential drug candidates. The present review is intended to give an overview of the strategies and current progress in using machine learning methods for drug design and the potential of the respective model development tools. We also regard a number of applications of the machine learning algorithms based on common classes of diseases.

ID AUTOMATION
AB Human-robot collaboration is becoming increasingly important as robots become more involved in various aspects of human life in the era of Artificial Intelligence. However, the issue of human operators' trust in robots remains a significant concern, primarily due to the lack of adequate semantic understanding and communication between humans and robots. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, provides an opportunity to develop an interactive, communicative, and robust human-robot collaboration approach. This paper explores the impact of ChatGPT on trust in a human-robot collaboration assembly task. This study designs a robot control system called RoboGPT using ChatGPT to control a 7-degree-of-freedom robot arm to help human operators fetch, and place tools, while human operators can communicate with and control the robot arm using natural language. A human-subject experiment showed that incorporating ChatGPT in robots significantly increased trust in human-robot collaboration, which can be attributed to the robot's ability to communicate more effectively with humans. Furthermore, ChatGPT's ability to understand the nuances of human language and respond appropriately helps to build a more natural and intuitive human-robot interaction. The findings of this study have significant implications for the development of trustworthy human-robot collaboration systems.

This model capitalizes on the fact that the certainty-factor-based activation function can improve the network generalization performance from a limited amount of training data. The formal properties of the procedure far extracting symbolic knowledge from such a trained neural network are investigated. In the domain of molecular genetics, a case study demonstrated that the described learning system effectively discovered the prior domain knowledge with some degree of refinement. Also, in cross-validation experiments, the system outperformed C4.5, a commonly used rule learning system.

AB Wearable sensing technologies can be used for precision livestock production and to study foraging strategies to better understand the relationships between herbivores, vegetation, and landscape. In this context, monitoring grazing behavior (i.e. chew and bite events) can provide critical information for livestock management. This study presents a computational tool that utilizes wearable sensing and deep learning to distinguish chew and bite events in horses. A micro camera equipped with a microphone (0?18 kHz) was used to obtain video/audio data from horses during grazing. The collected audio data were treated in a pre-processing filtering step, then used to train a recurrent neural network (RNN) with a long short-term memory (LSTM) layer to detect and distinguish chews, bites, and noise events. A post-processing sliding window technique was used to filter events with low confidence levels and lengths. Initial evaluation of this system showed an accuracy of 88.64% for bite identification and an accuracy of 94.13% for chew identification. The distinction between events and evaluation of responses to different pasture species and structure can provide useful information on the plant-animal interface. That is aligned to information such as bite rate, bite mass, and grazing time, and can help determine management strategies that optimize intake and provide data for modeling foraging behavior to predict pasture use and animal performance.

AB The complexity of transplant medicine pushes the boundaries of innate, human reasoning. From networks of immune modulators to dynamic pharmacokinetics to variable postoperative graft survival to equitable allocation of scarce organs, machine learning promises to inform clinical decision making by deciphering prodigious amounts of available data. This paper reviews current research describing how algorithms have the potential to augment clinical practice in solid organ transplantation. We provide a general introduction to different machine learning techniques, describing their strengths, limitations, and barriers to clinical implementation. We summarize emerging evidence that recent advances that allow machine learning algorithms to predict acute post-surgical and long-term outcomes, classify biopsy and radiographic data, augment pharmacologic decision making, and accurately represent the complexity of host immune response. Yet, many of these applications exist in pre-clinical form only, supported primarily by evidence of single-center, retrospective studies. Prospective investigation of these technologies has the potential to unlock the potential of machine learning to augment solid organ transplantation clinical care and health care delivery systems.

AB Objectives: To determine the optimal quantity of learning data needed to develop artificial intelligence (AI) that can automatically identify cephalometric landmarks.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 2400 cephalograms were collected, and 80 landmarks were manually identified by a human examiner. Of these, 2200 images were chosen as the learning data to train AI. The remaining 200 images were used as the test data. A total of 24 combinations of the quantity of learning data (50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, and 2000) were selected by the random sampling method without replacement, and the number of detecting targets per image (19, 40, and 80) were used in the AI training procedures. The training procedures were repeated four times. A total of 96 different AIs were produced. The accuracy of each AI was evaluated in terms of radial error.
   Results: The accuracy of AI increased linearly with the increasing number of learning data sets on a logarithmic scale. It decreased with increasing numbers of detection targets. To estimate the optimal quantity of learning data, a prediction model was built. At least 2300 sets of learning data appeared to be necessary to develop AI as accurate as human examiners.
   Conclusions: A considerably large quantity of learning data was necessary to develop accurate AI. The present study might provide a basis to determine how much learning data would be necessary in developing AI.

AB Computational surgery (CS) is an interdisciplinary field that uses mathematical models and algorithms to focus specifically on operative planning, simulation, and outcomes analysis to improve surgical care provision. As the digital revolution transforms the surgical work environment through broader adoption of artificial intelligence and machine learning, close collaboration between surgeons and computational scientists is not only unavoidable, but will become essential. In this review, the authors summarize the main advances, as well as ongoing challenges and prospects, that surround the implementation of CS techniques in vascular surgery, with a particular focus on the care of patients affected by abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). Several key areas of AAA care delivery, including patient-specific modelling, virtual surgery simulation, intraoperative imaging-guided surgery, and predictive analytics, as well as biomechanical analysis and machine learning, will be discussed. The overarching goals of these CS applications is to improve the precision and accuracy of AAA repair procedures, while enhancing safety and long-term outcomes. Accordingly, CS has the potential to significantly enhance patient care across the entire surgical journey, from preoperative planning and intraoperative decision making to postoperative surveillance. Moreover, CS-based approaches offer promising opportunities to augment AAA repair quality by enabling precise preoperative simulations, real-time intraoperative navigation, and robust postoperative monitoring. However, integrating these advanced computer-based technologies into medical research and clinical practice presents new challenges. These include addressing technical limitations, ensuring accuracy and reliability, and managing unique ethical considerations associated with their use. Thorough evaluation of these aspects of advanced computation techniques in AAA management is crucial before widespread integration into health care systems can be achieved. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

ID POISONING ATTACKS
AB With rapid progress and significant successes in a wide spectrum of applications, deep learning is being applied in many safety-critical environments. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been recently found vulnerable to well-designed input samples called adversarial examples. Adversarial perturbations are imperceptible to human but can easily fool DNNs in the testing/deploying stage. The vulnerability to adversarial examples becomes one of the major risks for applying DNNs in safety-critical environments. Therefore, attacks and defenses on adversarial examples draw great attention. In this paper, we review recent findings on adversarial examples for DNNs, summarize the methods for generating adversarial examples, and propose a taxonomy of these methods. Under the taxonomy, applications for adversarial examples are investigated. We further elaborate on countermeasures for adversarial examples. In addition, three major challenges in adversarial examples and the potential solutions are discussed.

AB Even though extensive efforts worked on traffic anomaly detection, this study noticed that little attention is given to predict public events before they start, like celebrations, sports games, and so on. Given a public event produces complicated spatiotemporal traffic impacts, existing data driven approaches without involving traffic flow analysis show limited effectiveness to predict a public event. Motivated by this view, this study seeks to develop a domain-knowledge-based learning approach, which integrates shock wave analysis into deep learning models to predict the occurring of an upcoming public event (i.e., the SW-DLM approach). This integration raises new research challenging and calls for new approaches. Specifically, we develop an efficient algorithm to generate the shock wave diagrams to present the evolvement of the traffic anomaly, which expands whenever new traffic data is collected. Next, the shock wave diagram itself is not a well-coded input for feature extraction and learning. This study thus developed an innovative encoding approach, which transforms a shock wave diagram into an optimal pixel grid. Considering the features extracted from the encoded shock wave diagrams are fed into the long short term memory (LSTM) model for the event prediction. The numerical experiments based on the field data indicate that the SW-DLM is able to predict a public event with 87% accuracy around 84 min before it starts in a day. It outperforms all data-driven machine learning models using point traffic data as inputs. Thus, we claim that using the shock wave diagrams can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of the learning approaches for predicting a public event. The SW-DLM will help develop preventive traffic control or route plans to avoid traffic congestion induced by public events.

AB Financial credit-risk evaluation is among a class of problems known to be semi-structured, where not all variables that are used for decision-making are either known or captured without error. Machine learning has been successfully used for credit-evaluation decisions. However, blindly applying machine learning methods to financial credit risk evaluation data with minimal knowledge of data may not always lead to expected results. We present and evaluate some data and methodological considerations that are taken into account when using machine learning methods for these decisions. Specifically, we consider the effects of preprocessing of credit-risk evaluation data used as input for machine learning methods. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This review provides an overview of apple detection and localization using image analysis and artificial intelligence techniques for enabling robotic fruit harvesting in orchard environments. Classic methods for detecting and localizing infield apples are discussed along with more advanced approaches using deep learning algorithms that have emerged in the past few years. Challenges faced in apple detection and localization such as occlusions, varying illumination conditions, and clustered apples are highlighted, as well as the impact of environmental factors such as light changes on the performance of these algorithms. Potential future research perspectives are identified through a comprehensive literature analysis. These include combining cutting-edge deep learning and multi-vision and multi-modal sensors to potentially apply them in real-time for apple harvesting robots. Additionally, utilizing 3D vision for a thorough analysis of complex and dynamic orchard environments, and precise determination of fruit locations using point cloud data and depth information are presented. The outcome of this review paper will assist researchers and engineers in the development of advanced detection and localization mechanisms for infield apples. The anticipated result is the facilitation of progress toward commercial apple harvest robots.

AB In the current research, gene expression programming (GEP) was applied to model reference evapotranspiration (ETo) in 18 regions of Iran with limited meteorological data. Initially, a genetic algorithm (GA) was employed to detect the most important variables for estimating ETo among mean temperature (Tmean), maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum temperature (Tmin), relative humidity (RH), sunshine (n), and wind speed (WS). The results indicated that a coupled model containing the Tmean and WS can predict ETo accurately (RMSE = 0.3263 mm day(-1)) for arid, semiarid, and Mediterranean climates. Therefore, this model was adjusted using the GEP for all 18 synoptic stations. Under very humid climates, it is recommended to use a temperature-based GEP model versus wind speed-based GEP model. The optimal and lowest performance of the GEP belonged to Shahrekord (SK), RMSE = 0.0650 mm day(-1), and Kerman (KE), RMSE = 0.4177 mm day(-1), respectively. This research shows that the GEP is a robust tool to model ETo in semiarid and Mediterranean climates (R-2 > 0.80). However, GEP is recommended to be used cautiously under very humid climates and some of arid regions (R-2 < 0.50) due to its poor performance under such extreme conditions.

AB Measurement of plant characteristics is still the primary bottleneck in both plant breeding and crop management. Rapid and accurate acquisition of information about large plant populations is critical for monitoring plant health and dissecting the underlying genetic traits. In recent years, high-throughput phenotyping technology has benefitted immensely from both remote sensing and machine learning. Simultaneous use of multiple sensors (e.g., high-resolution RGB, multispectral, hyperspectral, chlorophyll fluorescence, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR)) allows a range of spatial and spectral resolutions depending on the trait in question. Meanwhile, computer vision and machine learning methodology have emerged as powerful tools for extracting useful biological information from image data. Together, these tools allow the evaluation of various morphological, structural, biophysical, and biochemical traits. In this review, we focus on the recent development of phenomics approaches in strawberry farming, particularly those utilizing remote sensing and machine learning, with an eye toward future prospects for strawberries in precision agriculture. The research discussed is broadly categorized according to strawberry traits related to (1) fruit/flower detection, fruit maturity, fruit quality, internal fruit attributes, fruit shape, and yield prediction; (2) leaf and canopy attributes; (3) water stress; and (4) pest and disease detection. Finally, we present a synthesis of the potential research opportunities and directions that could further promote the use of remote sensing and machine learning in strawberry farming.

AB Numerous studies have compared machine learning (ML) and discrete choice models (DCMs) in predicting travel demand. However, these studies often lack generalizability as they compare models deterministically without considering contextual variations. To address this limitation, our study develops an empirical benchmark by designing a tournament model to learn the intrinsic predictive values of ML and DCMs. This novel approach enables us to efficiently summarize a large number of experiments, quantify the randomness in model comparisons, and use formal statistical tests to differentiate between the model and contextual effects. This benchmark study compares two large-scale data sources: a database compiled from literature review summarizing 136 experiments from 35 studies, and our own experiment data, encompassing a total of 6970 experiments from 105 models and 12 model families, tested repeatedly on three datasets, sample sizes, and choice categories. This benchmark study yields two key findings. Firstly, many ML models, particularly the ensemble methods and deep learning, statistically outperform the DCM family and its individual variants (i.e., multinomial, nested, and mixed logit), thus corroborating with the previous research. However, this study also highlights the crucial role of the contextual factors (i.e., data sources, inputs and choice categories), which can explain models' predictive performance more effectively than the differences in model types alone. Model performance varies significantly with data sources, improving with larger sample sizes and lower dimensional alternative sets. After controlling all the model and contextual factors, significant randomness still remains, implying inherent uncertainty in such model comparisons. Overall, we suggest that future researchers shift more focus from context-specific and deterministic model comparisons towards examining model transferability across contexts and characterizing the inherent uncertainty in ML, thus creating more robust and generalizable next-generation travel demand models.

AB Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been increasingly applied in travel demand modeling because of their automatic feature learning, high predictive performance, and economic interpretability. Nevertheless, DNNs frequently present behaviorally irregular patterns, significantly limiting their practical potentials and theoretical validity in travel behavior modeling. This study proposes strong and weak behavioral regularities as novel metrics to evaluate the monotonicity of individual demand functions (known as the "law of demand"), and further designs a constrained optimization framework with six gradient regularizers to enhance DNNs' behavioral regularity. The empirical benefits of this framework are illustrated by applying these regularizers to travel survey data from Chicago and London, which enables us to examine the trade-off between predictive power and behavioral regularity for large versus small sample scenarios and in-domain versus out-of-domain generalizations. The results demonstrate that, unlike models with strong behavioral foundations such as the multinomial logit, the benchmark DNNs cannot guarantee behavioral regularity. However, after applying gradient regularization, we increase DNNs' behavioral regularity by around 6 percentage points while retaining their relatively high predictive power. In the small sample scenario, gradient regularization is more effective than in the large sample scenario, simultaneously improving behavioral regularity by about 20 percentage points and log-likelihood by around 1.7%. Compared with the in- domain generalization of DNNs, gradient regularization works more effectively in out-of-domain generalization: it drastically improves the behavioral regularity of poorly performing benchmark DNNs by around 65 percentage points, highlighting the criticality of behavioral regularization for improving model transferability and applications in forecasting. Moreover, the proposed optimization framework is applicable to other neural network-based choice models such as TasteNets. Future studies could use behavioral regularity as a metric along with log-likelihood, prediction accuracy, and F1 1 score when evaluating travel demand models, and investigate other methods to further enhance behavioral regularity when adopting complex machine learning models.

AB Travel-time estimation of traffic flow is an important problem with critical implications for traffic congestion analysis. We developed techniques for using intersection videos to identify vehicle trajectories across multiple cameras and analyze corridor travel time. Our approach consists of (1) multiobject single-camera tracking, (2) vehicle re-identification among different cameras, (3) multi-object multi-camera tracking, and (4) travel-time estimation. We evaluated the proposed framework on real intersections in Florida with pan and fisheye cameras. The experimental results demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of our method.

AB Deep learning (DL) models are increasingly built on federated edge participants holding local data. To enable insight extractions without the risk of information leakage, DL training is usually combined with differential privacy (DP). The core theme is to tradeoff learning accuracy by adding statistically calibrated noises, particularly to local gradients of edge learners, during model training. However, this privacy guarantee unfortunately degrades model accuracy due to edge learners' local noises, and the global noise aggregated at the central server. Existing DP frameworks for edge focus on local noise calibration via gradient clipping techniques, overlooking the heterogeneity and dynamic changes of local gradients, and their aggregated impact on accuracy. In this article, we present a systematical analysis that unveils the influential factors capable of mitigating local and aggregated noises, and design PrivateDL to leverage these factors in noise calibration so as to improve model accuracy while fulfilling privacy guarantee. PrivateDL features on: (i) sampling-based sensitivity estimation for local noise calibration and (ii) combining large batch sizes and critical data identification in global training. We implement PrivateDL on the popular Laplace/Gaussian DP mechanisms and demonstrate its effectiveness using Intel BigDL workloads, i.e., considerably improving model accuracy by up to 5X when comparing against existing DP frameworks.

DE artificial intelligence; behavioral research; large language models
AB Large Language Models have been incorporated into an astounding breadth of professional domains. Given their capabilities, many intellectual laborers naturally question to what extent these AI models will be able to usurp their own jobs. As behavioral scientists, we performed an effort to examine the extent to which an AI can perform our roles. To achieve this, we utilized commercially available AIs (e.g., ChatGPT 4) to perform each step of the research process, culminating in an AI-written manuscript. We attempted to intervene as little as possible in the AI-led idea generation, empirical testing, analysis, and reporting. This allowed us to assess the limits of AIs in a behavioral research context and propose guidelines for behavioral researchers wanting to utilize AI. We found that the AIs were adept at some parts of the process and wholly inadequate at others. Our overall recommendation is that behavioral researchers use AIs judiciously and carefully monitor the outputs for quality and coherence. We additionally draw implications for editorial teams, doctoral student training, and the broader research ecosystem.

AB Genotype imputation is a foundational tool for population genetics. Standard statistical imputation approaches rely on the co-location of large whole-genome sequencing-based reference panels, powerful computing environments, and potentially sensitive genetic study data. This results in computational resource and privacy-risk barriers to access to cutting-edge imputation techniques. Moreover, the accuracy of current statistical approaches is known to degrade in regions of low and complex linkage disequilibrium. Artificial neural network-based imputation approaches may overcome these limitations by encoding complex genotype relationships in easily portable inference models. Here, we demonstrate an autoencoder-based approach for genotype imputation, using a large, commonly used reference panel, and spanning the entirety of human chromosome 22. Our autoencoder-based genotype imputation strategy achieved superior imputation accuracy across the allele-frequency spectrum and across genomes of diverse ancestry, while delivering at least fourfold faster inference run time relative to standard imputation tools.

AB Background: Patients' family history (FH) is a critical risk factor associated with numerous diseases. However, FH information is not well captured in the structured database but often documented in clinical narratives. Natural language processing (NLP) is the key technology to extract patients' FH from clinical narratives. In 2019, the National NLP Clinical Challenge (n2c2) organized shared tasks to solicit NLP methods for FH information extraction.
   Objective: This study presents our end-to-end FH extraction system developed during the 2019 n2c2 open shared task as well as the new transformer-based models that we developed after the challenge. We seek to develop a machine learning-based solution for FH information extraction without task-specific rules created by hand.
   Methods: We developed deep learning-based systems for FH concept extraction and relation identification. We explored deep learning models including long short-term memory-conditional random fields and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) as well as developed ensemble models using a majority voting strategy. To further optimize performance, we systematically compared 3 different strategies to use BERT output representations for relation identification.
   Results: Our system was among the top-ranked systems (3 out of 21) in the challenge. Our best system achieved micro-averaged F1 scores of 0.7944 and 0.6544 for concept extraction and relation identification, respectively. After challenge, we further explored new transformer-based models and improved the performances of both subtasks to 0.8249 and 0.6775, respectively. For relation identification, our system achieved a performance comparable to the best system (0.6810) reported in the challenge.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing deep learning methods to extract FH information from clinical narratives.

AB Early and accurate detection of cervical lymph nodes is essential for the optimal management and staging of patients with head and neck malignancies. Pilot studies have demonstrated the potential for radiomic and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in increasing diagnostic accuracy for the detection and classification of lymph nodes, but implementation of many of these approaches in real-world clinical settings would necessitate an automated lymph node segmentation pipeline as a first step. In this study, we aim to develop a non-invasive deep learning (DL) algorithm for detecting and automatically segmenting cervical lymph nodes in 25,119 CT slices from 221 normal neck contrast-enhanced CT scans from patients without head and neck cancer. We focused on the most challenging task of segmentation of small lymph nodes, evaluated multiple architectures, and employed U-Net and our adapted spatial context network to detect and segment small lymph nodes measuring 5-10 mm. The developed algorithm achieved a Dice score of 0.8084, indicating its effectiveness in detecting and segmenting cervical lymph nodes despite their small size. A segmentation framework successful in this task could represent an essential initial block for future algorithms aiming to evaluate small objects such as lymph nodes in different body parts, including small lymph nodes looking normal to the naked human eye but harboring early nodal metastases.

AB In this paper, we propose a novel approach to commodity classification from surveillance videos by utilizing logo data on trucks. Broadly, most logos can be classified as predominantly text or predominantly images. For the former, we leverage state-of-the-art deep-learning-based text recognition algorithms on images. For the latter, we develop a two-stage image retrieval algorithm consisting of a universal logo detection stage that outputs all potential logo positions, followed by a logo recognition stage designed to incorporate advanced image representations. We develop an integrated approach to combine predictions from both the text-based and image-based solutions, which can help determine the commodity type that is potentially being hauled by trucks. We evaluated these models on videos collected in collaboration with the state transportation entity and achieved promising performance. This, along with prior work on trailer classification, can be effectively used for automatically deriving commodity types for trucks moving on highways.

ID ENTITY RECOGNITION; CLASSIFICATION
AB Pulmonary nodules and nodule characteristics are important indicators of lung nodule malignancy. However, nodule information is often documented as free text in clinical narratives such as radiology reports in electronic health record systems. Natural language processing (NLP) is the key technology to extract and standardize patient information from radiology reports into structured data elements. This study aimed to develop an NLP system using state-of-the-art transformer models to extract pulmonary nodules and associated nodule characteristics from radiology reports. We identified a cohort of 3080 patients who underwent LDCT at the University of Florida health system and collected their radiology reports. We manually annotated 394 reports as the gold standard. We explored eight pretrained transformer models from three transformer architectures including bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), robustly optimized BERT approach (RoBERTa), and A Lite BERT (ALBERT), for clinical concept extraction, relation identification, and negation detection. We examined general transformer models pretrained using general English corpora, transformer models fine-tuned using a clinical corpus, and a large clinical transformer model, GatorTron, which was trained from scratch using 90 billion words of clinical text. We compared transformer models with two baseline models including a recurrent neural network implemented using bidirectional long short-term memory with a conditional random fields layer and support vector machines. RoBERTa-mimic achieved the best F1-score of 0.9279 for nodule concept and nodule characteristics extraction. ALBERT-base and GatorTron achieved the best F1-score of 0.9737 in linking nodule characteristics to pulmonary nodules. Seven out of eight transformers achieved the best F1-score of 1.0000 for negation detection. Our end-to-end system achieved an overall F1-score of 0.8869. This study demonstrated the advantage of state-of-the-art transformer models for pulmonary nodule information extraction from radiology reports.

AB In recent years, continuous growing interests have been seen in bringing artificial intelligence capabilities to mobile devices. However, the related work still faces several issues, such as constrained computation and memory resources, power drain, and thermal limitation. To develop deep learning (DL) algorithms on mobile devices, we need to understand their behaviors. In this article, we explore the architectural behaviors of some mainstream DL frameworks on mobile devices by performing a comprehensive characterization of performance, accuracy, energy efficiency, and thermal behaviors. We experimentally choose four model compression methods to perform on networks and in addition, analyze the related impact on the nodes amount, memory, execution time, model size, inference time, energy consumption, and thermal distribution. With insights into DL-based mobile application characteristics, we hope to guide the design of future smartphone platforms for lower energy consumption.

AB Objectives: To provide an introduction to the uses of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and foundation models, including large language models, in the field of health technology assessment (HTA). Methods: We reviewed applications of generative AI in 3 areas: systematic literature reviews, real- world evidence, and health economic modeling. Results: (1) Literature reviews: generative AI has the potential to assist in automating aspects of systematic literature reviews by proposing search terms, screening abstracts, extracting data, and generating code for meta-analyses; (2) real-world evidence: generative AI can facilitate automating processes and analyze large collections of real-world data, including unstructured clinical notes and imaging; (3) health economic modeling: generative AI can aid in the development of health economic models, from conceptualization to validation. Limitations in the use of foundation models and large language models include challenges surrounding their scientific rigor and reliability, the potential for bias, implications for equity, as well as nontrivial concerns regarding adherence to regulatory and ethical standards, particularly in terms of data privacy and security. Additionally, we survey the current policy landscape and provide suggestions for HTA agencies on responsibly integrating generative AI into their workflows, emphasizing the importance of human oversight and the fast-evolving nature of these tools. Conclusions: Although generative AI technology holds promise with respect to HTA applications, it is still undergoing rapid developments and improvements. Continued careful evaluation of their applications to HTA is required. Both developers and users of research incorporating these tools, should familiarize themselves with their current capabilities and limitations.

AB Using artificial intelligence (AI) models, cost effective electricity meter, and easily accessible weather data, this paper discusses a methodology for improved prediction of hourly residential space heating electricity use. Four AI models [back propagation neural network (BPNN), radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), general regression neural network (GRNN), and support vector regression (SVR)] were used for predicting hourly residential heating electricity use. For this study, a typical single-family house was used to obtain the data used for AI prediction models. Results showed SVR's ability to predict hourly residential heating electricity use was better when compared with other AI models. Furthermore, through comparison of prediction performance in different time periods, additional investigation was conducted to evaluate the effect of dynamic human behaviors on the prediction accuracy of the AI models. Results revealed that dynamic human behaviors have a negative effect on the prediction performance.

AB The need for interpretable and accountable intelligent systems grows along with the prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI) applications used in everyday life. Explainable AI (XAI) systems are intended to selfexplain the reasoning behind system decisions and predictions. Researchers from different disciplines work together to define, design, and evaluate explainable systems. However, scholars from different disciplines focus on different objectives and fairly independent topics of XAI research, which poses challenges for identifying appropriate design and evaluation methodology and consolidating knowledge across efforts. To this end, this article presents a survey and framework intended to share knowledge and experiences of XAI design and evaluation methods across multiple disciplines. Aiming to support diverse design goals and evaluation methods in XAI research, after a thorough review of XAI related papers in the fields of machine learning, visualization, and human-computer interaction, we present a categorization of XAI design goals and evaluation methods. Our categorization presents the mapping between design goals for different XAI user groups and their evaluation methods. From our findings, we develop a framework with step-by-step design guidelines paired with evaluation methods to close the iterative design and evaluation cycles in multidisciplinary XAI teams. Further, we provide summarized ready-to-use tables of evaluation methods and recommendations for different goals in XAI research.

AB With the advances in machine learning for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), most studies have focused on either identifying the subject's status through classification algorithms or on predicting their cognitive scores through regression methods, neglecting the potential association between these two tasks. Motivated by the need to enhance the prospects for early diagnosis along with the ability to predict future disease states, this study proposes a deep neural network based on modality fusion, kernelization, and tensorization that perform multiclass classification and longitudinal regression simultaneously within a unified multitask framework. This relationship between multiclass classification and longitudinal regression is found to boost the efficacy of the final model in dealing with both tasks. Different multimodality scenarios are investigated, and complementary aspects of the multimodal features are exploited to simultaneously delineate the subject's label and predict related cognitive scores at future timepoints using baseline data. The main intent in this multitask framework is to consolidate the highest accuracy possible in terms of precision, sensitivity, F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC) in the multiclass classification task while maintaining the highest similarity in the MMSE score as measured through the correlation coefficient and the RMSE for all time points under the prediction task, with both tasks, run simultaneously under the same set of hyperparameters. The overall accuracy for multiclass classification of the proposed KTMnet method is 66.85 +/- 3.77. The prediction results show an average RMSE of 2.32 +/- 0.52 and a correlation of 0.71 +/- 5.98 for predicting MMSE throughout the time points. These results are compared to state-of-the-art techniques reported in the literature. A discovery from the multitasking of this consolidated machine learning framework is that a set of hyperparameters that optimize the prediction results may not necessarily be the same as those that would optimize the multiclass classification. In other words, there is a breakpoint beyond which enhancing further the results of one process could lead to the downgrading in accuracy for the other.

AB Objective: To develop a natural language processing (NLP) system to extract medications and contextual infor-mation that help understand drug changes. This project is part of the 2022 n2c2 challenge. Materials and methods: We developed NLP systems for medication mention extraction, event classification (indicating medication changes discussed or not), and context classification to classify medication changes context into 5 orthogonal dimensions related to drug changes. We explored 6 state-of-the-art pretrained trans-former models for the three subtasks, including GatorTron, a large language model pretrained using > 90 billion words of text (including > 80 billion words from > 290 million clinical notes identified at the University of Florida Health). We evaluated our NLP systems using annotated data and evaluation scripts provided by the 2022 n2c2 organizers. Results: Our GatorTron models achieved the best F1-scores of 0.9828 for medication extraction (ranked 3rd), 0.9379 for event classification (ranked 2nd), and the best micro-average accuracy of 0.9126 for context classi-fication. GatorTron outperformed existing transformer models pretrained using smaller general English text and clinical text corpora, indicating the advantage of large language models. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the advantage of using large transformer models for contextual medication information extraction from clinical narratives.

AB Objective:To summarize state-of-the-art artificial intelligence-enabled decision support in surgery and to quantify deficiencies in scientific rigor and reporting. Background:To positively affect surgical care, decision-support models must exceed current reporting guideline requirements by performing external and real-time validation, enrolling adequate sample sizes, reporting model precision, assessing performance across vulnerable populations, and achieving clinical implementation; the degree to which published models meet these criteria is unknown. Methods:Embase, PubMed, and MEDLINE databases were searched from their inception to September 21, 2022 for articles describing artificial intelligence-enabled decision support in surgery that uses preoperative or intraoperative data elements to predict complications within 90 days of surgery. Scientific rigor and reporting criteria were assessed and reported according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. Results:Sample size ranged from 163-2,882,526, with 8/36 articles (22.2%) featuring sample sizes of less than 2000; 7 of these 8 articles (87.5%) had below-average (<0.83) area under the receiver operating characteristic or accuracy. Overall, 29 articles (80.6%) performed internal validation only, 5 (13.8%) performed external validation, and 2 (5.6%) performed real-time validation. Twenty-three articles (63.9%) reported precision. No articles reported performance across sociodemographic categories. Thirteen articles (36.1%) presented a framework that could be used for clinical implementation; none assessed clinical implementation efficacy. Conclusions:Artificial intelligence-enabled decision support in surgery is limited by reliance on internal validation, small sample sizes that risk overfitting and sacrifice predictive performance, and failure to report confidence intervals, precision, equity analyses, and clinical implementation. Researchers should strive to improve scientific quality.

ID SYSTEM
AB Medical diagnosis plays a critical role in the early detection and treatment of diseases by examining symptoms and supporting findings through advanced laboratory testing. Early and accurate diagnosis is essential for detecting medical problems and then prescribing the most effective treatment strategies, especially in life-threatening diseases such as leukemia. Leukemia, a blood malignancy, is one of the most prevalent cancer types affecting both adults and children. It is caused by the rapid and uncontrolled growth of abnormal white blood cells in the bone marrow. This accumulation interferes with the production of normal blood cells, leading to a weakened immune deficiency, anemia, and bleeding disorders. Conventional leukemia diagnostic methods are time-consuming, manually intensive, and inefficient. This research study proposes an automatic diagnostics prediction of leukemia by analyzing blood images according to the shape of the blast cells using digital image processing and machine learning. The purpose of blood cell detection is to precisely identify and classify diverse blood cells, detecting anomalies associated with blood cancers like leukemia. This supports early diagnosis and monitoring, which leads to more effective treatments and improved results for cancer patients. To accomplish this task, we use digital image processing techniques and then apply the convolutional neural network (CNN) deep learning algorithm to blood sample images. This research employs a multi-stage methodology, including data preparation, data preprocessing, feature extraction, and then classification. While our model is built on a typical CNN architecture, we make significant advances by using preprocessing techniques and hyperparameter tuning. We have modified its layers combination to include convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers that are optimized for image characteristics. These layers are fine-tuned for better feature extraction and classification accuracy. This study showed that blood cell detection for diagnosing acute leukemia based on images had 99% accuracy and outperformed other advanced models, including DenseNet121, ResNet-50, Incep-tionv3, MobileNet, and EfficientNet. The comprehensive analysis of the results reveals the highest accuracy of leukemia detection as compared to existing studies in the relevant literature.

AB Artificial intelligence has underdelivered in improving health care. In 1970, a New England Journal of Medicine special article projected that computer science would augment or replace many intellectual functions of physicians.1 Over the past 50 years, surgical literature has been similarly optimistic despite a paucity of highlevel supporting evidence. The corresponding author may be guilty of perpetuating this disproportionate optimism. This article seeks to balance the discussion surrounding artificial intelligence in surgical decision-making by describing major barriers and potential solutions toward safe, effective clinical adoption of artificial intelligence-enabled decision-support platforms in surgery.

AB Background: Machine learning techniques have shown excellent performance in three-dimensional medical image analysis, but have not been applied to acute uncomplicated type B aortic dissection (auTBAD) using Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) and Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS)-defined aortic zones. The purpose of this study was to establish a trained, automatic machine learning aortic zone segmentation model to facilitate performance of an aortic zone volumetric comparison between patients with auTBAD based on the rate of aortic growth. Methods: Patients with auTBAD and serial imaging were identified. For each patient, imaging characteristics from two computed tomography (CT) scans were analyzed: (1) the baseline CT angiography (CTA) at the index admission and (2) either the most recent surveillance CTA or the most recent CTA before an aortic intervention. Patients were stratified into two comparative groups based on aortic growth: rapid growth (diameter increase of >= 5 mm/year) and no or slow growth (diameter increase of <5 mm/year). Deidentified images were imported into an open source software package for medical image analysis and images were annotated based on SVS/STS criteria for aortic zones. Our model was trained using four-fold cross-validation. The segmentation output was used to calculate aortic zone volumes from each imaging study. Results: Of 59 patients identified for inclusion, rapid growth was observed in 33 patients (56%) and no or slow growth was observed in 26 patients (44%). There were no differences in baseline demographics, comorbidities, admission mean arterial pressure, number of discharge antihypertensives, or high-risk imaging characteristics between groups (P > .05 for all). Median duration between baseline and interval CT was 1.07 years (interquartile range [IQR], 0.38-2.57). Postdischarge aortic intervention was performed in 13 patients (22%) at a mean of 1.5 +/- 1.2 years, with no difference between the groups (P > .05). Among all patients, the largest relative percent increases in zone volumes over time were found in zone 4 (13.9%; IQR, -6.82 to 35.1) and zone 5 (13.4%; IQR, -7.78 to 37.9). There were no differences in baseline zone volumes between groups (P > .05 for all). The average Dice coefficient, a performance measure of the model output, was 0.73. Performance was best in zone 5 (0.84) and zone 9 (0.91). Conclusions: We describe an automatic deep learning segmentation model incorporating SVS-defined aortic zones. The open source, trained model demonstrates concordance to the manually segmented aortas with the strongest performance in zones 5 and 9, providing a framework for further clinical applications. In our limited sample, there were no differences in baseline aortic zone volumes between patients with rapid growth and patients with no or slow growth.

AB Facing the escalating effects of climate change, it is critical to improve the prediction and understanding of the hurricane evacuation decisions made by households in order to enhance emergency management. Current studies in this area often have relied on psychology-driven linear models, which frequently exhibited limitations in practice. The present study proposed a novel interpretable machine learning approach to predict household-level evacuation decisions by leveraging easily accessible demographic and resource-related predictors, compared to existing models that mainly rely on psychological factors. An enhanced logistic regression model (that is, an interpretable machine learning approach) was developed for accurate predictions by automatically accounting for nonlinearities and interactions (that is, univariate and bivariate threshold effects). Specifically, nonlinearity and interaction detection were enabled by low-depth decision trees, which offer transparent model structure and robustness. A survey dataset collected in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, two of the most intense tropical storms of the last two decades, was employed to test the new methodology. The findings show that, when predicting the households' evacuation decisions, the enhanced logistic regression model outperformed previous linear models in terms of both model fit and predictive capability. This outcome suggests that our proposed methodology could provide a new tool and framework for emergency management authorities to improve the prediction of evacuation traffic demands in a timely and accurate manner.

AB Traditional probability estimation often demands a large amount of data for a problem of industrial scale. Neural networks have been used as an effective alternative for estimating input-output probabilities. In this paper, the certainty-factor-based neural network (CFNet) is explored for probability estimation in discrete domains. A new analysis presented here shows that the basis functions learned by the CFNet can bear precise semantics for dependencies. In the simulation study, the CFNet outperforms both the backpropagation network and the system based on the Rademacher-Walsh expansion. In the real-data experiments on splice junction and breast cancer data sets, the CFNet outperforms other neural networks and symbolic systems.

ID FINANCIAL RATIOS; DISTRESS; CLASSIFIERS; SELECTION; ENSEMBLE
AB Predicting corporate bankruptcy is one of the fundamental tasks in credit risk assessment. In particular, since the 2007/2008 financial crisis, it has become a priority for most financial institutions, practitioners, and academics. The recent advancements in machine learning (ML) enabled the development of several models for bankruptcy prediction. The most challenging aspect of this task is dealing with the class imbalance due to the rarity of bankruptcy events in the real economy. Furthermore, a fair comparison in the literature is difficult to make because bankruptcy datasets are not publicly available and because studies often restrict their datasets to specific economic sectors and markets and/or time periods. In this work, we investigated the design and the application of different ML models to two different tasks related to default events: (a) estimating survival probabilities over time; (b) default prediction using time-series accounting data with different lengths. The entire dataset used for the experiments has been made available to the scientific community for further research and benchmarking purposes. The dataset pertains to 8262 different public companies listed on the American stock market between 1999 and 2018. Finally, in light of the results obtained, we critically discuss the most interesting metrics as proposed benchmarks for future studies.

AB Background Machine learning techniques can identify complex relationships in large healthcare datasets and build prediction models that better inform physicians in ways that can assist in patient treatment decision-making. In the domain of shoulder arthroplasty, machine learning appears to have the potential to anticipate patients' results after surgery, but this has not been well explored. Questions/purposes (1) What is the accuracy of machine learning to predict the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (ASES), University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), Constant, global shoulder function, and VAS pain scores, as well as active abduction, forward flexion, and external rotation at 1 year, 2 to 3 years, 3 to 5 years, and more than 5 years after anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (aTSA) or reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA)? (2) What is the accuracy of machine learning to identify whether a patient will achieve clinical improvement that exceeds the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) threshold for each outcome measure? (3) What is the accuracy of machine learning to identify whether a patient will achieve clinical improvement that exceeds the substantial clinical benefit threshold for each outcome measure? Methods A machine learning analysis was conducted on a database of 7811 patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty of one prosthesis design to create predictive models for multiple clinical outcome measures. Excluding patients with revisions, fracture indications, and hemiarthroplasty resulted in 6210 eligible primary aTSA and rTSA patients, of whom 4782 patients with 11,198 postoperative follow-up visits had sufficient preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data to train and test the predictive models. Preoperative clinical data from 1895 primary aTSA patients and 2887 primary rTSA patients were analyzed using three commercially available supervised machine learning techniques: linear regression, XGBoost, and Wide and Deep, to train and test predictive models for the ASES, UCLA, Constant, global shoulder function, and VAS pain scores, as well as active abduction, forward flexion, and external rotation. Our primary study goal was to quantify the accuracy of three machine learning techniques to predict each outcome measure at multiple postoperative timepoints after aTSA and rTSA using the mean absolute error between the actual and predicted values. Our secondary study goals were to identify whether a patient would experience clinical improvement greater than the MCID and substantial clinical benefit anchor-based thresholds of patient satisfaction for each outcome measure as quantified by the model classification parameters of precision, recall, accuracy, and area under the receiver operating curve. Results Each machine learning technique demonstrated similar accuracy to predict each outcome measure at each postoperative point for both aTSA and rTSA, though small differences in prediction accuracy were observed between techniques. Across all postsurgical timepoints, the Wide and Deep technique was associated with the smallest mean absolute error and predicted the postoperative ASES score to +/- 10.1 to 11.3 points, the UCLA score to +/- 2.5 to 3.4, the Constant score to +/- 7.3 to 7.9, the global shoulder function score to +/- 1.0 to 1.4, the VAS pain score to +/- 1.2 to 1.4, active abduction to +/- 18 to 21 degrees, forward elevation to +/- 15 to 17 degrees, and external rotation to +/- 10 to 12 degrees.
   These models also accurately identified the patients who did and did not achieve clinical improvement that exceeded the MCID (93% to 99% accuracy for patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and 85% to 94% for pain, function, and ROM measures) and substantial clinical benefit (82% to 93% accuracy for PROMs and 78% to 90% for pain, function, and ROM measures) thresholds. Conclusions Machine learning techniques can use preoperative data to accurately predict clinical outcomes at multiple postoperative points after shoulder arthroplasty and accurately risk-stratify patients by preoperatively identifying who may and who may not achieve MCID and substantial clinical benefit improvement thresholds for each outcome measure.

AB We have recently developed a charge inversion ion/ion reaction to selectively derivatize phosphatidylserine lipids via gas-phase Schiff base formation. This tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) workflow enables the separation and detection of isobaric lipids in imaging mass spectrometry, but the images acquired using this workflow are limited to relatively poor spatial resolutions due to the current time and limit of detection requirements for these ion/ion reaction imaging mass spectrometry experiments. This trade-off between chemical specificity and spatial resolution can be overcome by using computational image fusion, which combines complementary information from multiple images. Herein, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept workflow that fuses a low spatial resolution (i.e., 125 mu m) ion/ion reaction product ion image with higher spatial resolution (i.e., 25 mu m) ion images from a full scan experiment performed using the same tissue section, which results in a predicted ion/ion reaction product ion image with a 5-fold improvement in spatial resolution. Linear regression, random forest regression, and two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2-D CNN) predictive models were tested for this workflow. Linear regression and 2D CNN models proved optimal for predicted ion/ion images of PS 40:6 and SHexCer d38:1, respectively.

DE Integrity attack; neural networks; multi-tenant device; evaluation tool
AB Multi-tenant applications have been proliferating in recent years, supported by the emergence of computingas-service paradigms. Unfortunately, multi-tenancy induces new security vulnerabilities due to spatial or temporal co-location of applications with possibly malicious intent. In this article, we consider a special class of stealthy integrity attacks on multi-tenant deep learning accelerators. One interesting conclusion is that it is possible to perform targeted integrity attacks on kernel weights of deep learning systems such that it remains functional but mis-labels specific categories of input data through standard RowHammer attacks by only changing 0.0009% of the total weights. We develop an automated framework, AROMA, to evaluate the impact of multi-tenancy on security of deep learning accelerators against integrity attacks on memory systems. We present extensive evaluations on AroMa to demonstrate its effectiveness.

AB Developing deterministic neighborhood-informed point-particle closure models using machine learning has garnered interest recently from the dispersed multiphase flow community. The robustness of neural models for this complex multibody problem is hindered by the availability of particle-resolved data. The present work addresses this unavoidable limitation of data paucity by implementing two strategies: (1) by using a rotation and reflection equivariant neural network and (2) by pursuing a physics-based hierarchical machine learning approach. The resulting machine-learned models are observed to achieve a maximum accuracy of 85% and 96% in the prediction of neighbor-induced force and torque fluctuations, respectively, for a wide range of Reynolds number and volume fraction conditions considered. Furthermore, we pursue force and torque network architectures that provide universal prediction spanning a wide range of Reynolds number (0.25 Re 250) and particle volume fraction (0 phi 0.4). The hierarchical nature of the approach enables improved prediction of quantities such as streamwise torque, by going beyond binary interactions to include trinary interactions.

TI A large language model for electronic health records
SO NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB There is an increasing interest in developing artificial intelligence (AI) systems to process and interpret electronic health records (EHRs). Natural language processing (NLP) powered by pretrained language models is the key technology for medical AI systems utilizing clinical narratives. However, there are few clinical language models, the largest of which trained in the clinical domain is comparatively small at 110 million parameters (compared with billions of parameters in the general domain). It is not clear how large clinical language models with billions of parameters can help medical AI systems utilize unstructured EHRs. In this study, we develop from scratch a large clinical language model-GatorTron-using > 90 billion words of text (including > 82 billion words of de-identified clinical text) and systematically evaluate it on five clinical NLP tasks including clinical concept extraction, medical relation extraction, semantic textual similarity, natural language inference (NLI), and medical question answering (MQA). We examine how (1) scaling up the number of parameters and (2) scaling up the size of the training data could benefit these NLP tasks. GatorTron models scale up the clinical language model from 110 million to 8.9 billion parameters and improve five clinical NLP tasks (e.g., 9.6% and 9.5% improvement in accuracy for NLI and MQA), which can be applied to medical AI systems to improve healthcare delivery.

AB Maximal correlation measures the statistical dependence between two random variables and has been broadly used by statisticians. In this paper, we present a novel regression framework based on a special case of the maximal correlation using the correlation ratio to train a Multiple-input Multiple-output (MIMO) model called the Bank of Wiener Models (BWM). Nonlinear time series modeling under maximal correlation unifies the cost and the mapping function under the same mathematical optimization framework. This provides direct optimality (maximal statistical dependence) between BWM model outputs and the desired response, without the restriction of constructing an error signal as conventionally done in regression. Based on the idea of correlation ratio, we propose the Maximal Correlation Algorithm (MCA), which approximates directly the correlation ratio between BWM outputs and the desired response. As an important consequence, MCA modularizes the training of models with hidden layers and avoids the end-to-end training of backpropagation (BP), while improving the equivalent mapping capability. We further propose several possible multi layer arrangements to create deep networks trained with MCA. We demonstrate experimentally that MCA performs at the same level of output error or better when compared to a single and multiple-hidden-layer MLP trained with BP and the Mean Squared Error (MSE). We also show that the system identification capabilities of MCA are superior to MLPs trained with BP. Hence, MCA has great promise in both nonlinear system identification and machine learning.

AB Background: Although zebrafish are increasingly utilized in biomedicine for CNS disease modelling and drug discovery, this generates big data necessitating objective, precise and reproducible analyses. The artificial intelligence (AI) applications have empowered automated image recognition and video-tracking to ensure more efficient behavioral testing. New method: Capitalizing on several AI tools that most recently became available, here we present a novel openaccess AI-driven platform to analyze tracks of adult zebrafish collected from in vivo neuropharmacological experiments. For this, we trained the AI system to distinguish zebrafish behavioral patterns following systemic treatment with several well-studied psychoactive drugs - nicotine, caffeine and ethanol. Results: Experiment 1 showed the ability of the AI system to distinguish nicotine and caffeine with 75 % and ethanol with 88 % probability and high (81 %) accuracy following a post-training exposure to these drugs. Experiment 2 further validated our system with additional, previously unexposed compounds (cholinergic arecoline and varenicline, and serotonergic fluoxetine), used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Comparison with existing methods: The present study introduces a novel open-access AI-driven approach to analyze locomotor activity of adult zebrafish. Conclusions: Taken together, these findings support the value of custom-made AI tools for unlocking full potential of zebrafish CNS drug research by monitoring, processing and interpreting the results of in vivo experiments.

AB Breast cancer ranks top incidence rate among all malignant tumors for women, globally. Early detection through regular preliminary screening is critical to decreasing the breast cancer's fatality rate. However, the promotion of preliminary screening faces major limitations of human diagnosis capacity, cost, and technical reliability in China and most of the world. To meet these challenges, we developed a solution featuring an innovative division of labor model by incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) with ultrasonography and cloud computing. The objective of this research was to develop a solution named "Dr.J", which applies AI to process real-time video live feed from ultrasonography, which is physically safe and more suitable for Asian women. It can automatically detect and highlight the suspected breast cancer lesions and provide BI-RADS (Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System) ratings to assist human diagnosis. "Dr.J" does not require its frontline operators to have prior medical or IT background and thus significantly lowers manpower threshold for preliminary screening promotion. Furthermore, its cloud computing platform can store detailed breast cancer data such as images and BI-RADS ratings for further essential needs in medical treatment, research and health management, etc. as well as establishing a hierarchy medical service network for this disease. Therefore, "Dr.J" significantly enhances the availability and accessibility of preliminary screening service for breast cancer at grassroots.

AB Objectives: To highlight the often overlooked role of user interface (UI) design in mitigating bias in artificial intelligence (AI)-based clinical decision support (CDS). Materials and Methods: This perspective paper discusses the interdependency between AI-based algorithm development and UI design and proposes strategies for increasing the safety and efficacy of CDS. Results: The role of design in biasing user behavior is well documented in behavioral economics and other disciplines. We offer an example of how UI designs play a role in how bias manifests in our machine learning-based CDS development. Discussion: Much discussion on bias in AI revolves around data quality and algorithm design; less attention is given to how UI design can exacerbate or mitigate limitations of AI-based applications. Conclusion: This work highlights important considerations including the role of UI design in reinforcing/mitigating bias, human factors methods for identifying issues before an application is released, and risk communication strategies.

Approach. This project was developed in parallel with our Intelligent Critical Care Center and represents a culmination of efforts to build an efficient and accurate model for data processing and predictive analytics. Main Results and Significance. This paper discusses how our model was constructed and improved upon. We highlight the consolidation of the database, processing of fixed and time-series physiologic measurements, development and training of predictive models, and expansion of those models into different aspects of patient assessment and treatment. We end by discussing future directions of the model.

AB The adoption of sensors and other technologies in modern agricultural systems has led to an increase in data availability for the optimization of crop management. Soil moisture (SM) forecasts, which heavily depend on the availability of SM sensor data, have the potential to reveal underlying processes that are not easily identified through day-to-day field management. The SM data's complexity and the temporal and spatial dynamic interrelation with other environmental factors present challenges that make it necessary to implement preprocessing techniques and models capable of adapting to the changing characteristics of the data. Recent studies have suggested that combining data preprocessing techniques, such as input time series (TS) decomposition, with ensemble forecasting models can reduce data complexity, improve forecast accuracy, and provide the model with the necessary robustness against extreme input values. In this study, we assess the efficiency of Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) and Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) as input TS decomposition techniques to improve the preprocessing and forecasting performance of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms. The results of this study suggest that the use of EEMD could have an average reduction of 44% in absolute errors while improving the interpretability of the data. In a case study on citrus production in Southeast Florida, we demonstrated that using EEMD as a preprocessing method significantly reduces prediction errors. This reduction could allow a substantial increase in water savings when users implement SM forecasts for irrigation scheduling.

AB Bipolar disorder, also known as manic depression, is a brain disorder that affects the brain structure of a patient. It results in extreme mood swings, severe states of depression, and overexcitement simultaneously. It is estimated that roughly 3% of the population of the United States (about 5.3 million adults) suffers from bipolar disorder. Recent research efforts like the Twin studies have demonstrated a high heritability factor for the disorder, making genomics a viable alternative for detecting and treating bipolar disorder, in addition to the conventional lengthy and costly postsymptom clinical diagnosis. Motivated by this study, leveraging several emerging deep learning algorithms, we design an end-to-end deep learning architecture (called DeepBipolar) to predict bipolar disorder based on limited genomic data. DeepBipolar adopts the Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) architecture that automatically extracts features from genotype information to predict the bipolar phenotype. We participated in the Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation (CAGI) bipolar disorder challenge and DeepBipolar was considered the most successful by the independent assessor. In this work, we thoroughly evaluate the performance of DeepBipolar and analyze the type of signals we believe could have affected the classifier in distinguishing the case samples from the control set.

AB Background: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and a medical emergency. The ADAMTS13 (AS13) activity assay is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Within the context of limited laboratory resources, a machine learning (ML) was developed to potentially reduce overutilization of AS13 testing and aid clinical colleagues in the future. Methods: A hybrid approach, consisting of both inhouse and literature data, was taken to acquire the data to train and test the decision tree (DT) ML model. The dataset consisted of 104 patients (30 inhouse, 74 literature-derived) with an equal mix of TTP to non-TTP patients (52 each). The features used to develop the supervised DT model were directly acquired from the PLASMIC score. Results: The optimized DT model overall accuracy on the testing dataset was 81%. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive were 100%, 69%, 67%, and 100%, respectively. Conclusions: We were able to improve the overall performance of the DT model while maintaining a high NPV. However, this invariably translated to potentially increased false positive results (outcomes classified as TTP are actually non-TTP), our overall goal was not to restrict testing on any potentially true TTP cases. This study was done with limited clinical laboratory resources and continues to be a project in progress. However, as laboratory specialists become more involved in artificial intelligence (AI)/ML initiatives, institutions will need to provide them with a modern information technology (IT) infrastructure with adequate resources to enable these efforts to meet the needs of the future health care system.

TI Community-engaged artificial intelligence research: A scoping review
SO PLOS DIGITAL HEALTH
LA English
DT Review
ID HEALTH; RISK
AB The degree to which artificial intelligence healthcare research is informed by data and stakeholders from community settings has not been previously described. As communities are the principal location of healthcare delivery, engaging them could represent an important opportunity to improve scientific quality. This scoping review systematically maps what is known and unknown about community-engaged artificial intelligence research and identifies opportunities to optimize the generalizability of these applications through involvement of community stakeholders and data throughout model development, validation, and implementation. Embase, PubMed, and MEDLINE databases were searched for articles describing artificial intelligence or machine learning healthcare applications with community involvement in model development, validation, or implementation. Model architecture and performance, the nature of community engagement, and barriers or facilitators to community engagement were reported according to PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. Of approximately 10,880 articles describing artificial intelligence healthcare applications, 21 (0.2%) described community involvement. All articles derived data from community settings, most commonly by leveraging existing datasets and sources that included community subjects, and often bolstered by internet-based data acquisition and subject recruitment. Only one article described inclusion of community stakeholders in designing an application-a natural language processing model that detected cases of likely child abuse with 90% accuracy using harmonized electronic health record notes from both hospital and community practice settings. The primary barrier to including community- derived data was small sample sizes, which may have affected 11 of the 21 studies (53%), introducing substantial risk for overfitting that threatens generalizability. Community engagement in artificial intelligence healthcare application development, validation, or implementation is rare. As healthcare delivery occurs primarily in community settings, investigators should consider engaging community stakeholders in user-centered design, usability, and clinical implementation studies to optimize generalizability.

AB Genomic prediction (GP) is the procedure whereby the genetic merits of untested candidates are predicted using genome wide marker information. Although numerous examples of GP exist in plants and animals, applications to polyploid organisms are still scarce, partly due to limited genome resources and the complexity of this system. Deep learning (DL) techniques comprise a heterogeneous collection of machine learning algorithms that have excelled at many prediction tasks. A potential advantage of DL for GP over standard linear model methods is that DL can potentially take into account all genetic interactions, including dominance and epistasis, which are expected to be of special relevance in most polyploids. In this study, we evaluated the predictive accuracy of linear and DL techniques in two important small fruits or berries: strawberry and blueberry. The two datasets contained a total of 1,358 allopolyploid strawberry (2n=8x=112) and 1,802 autopolyploid blueberry (2n=4x=48) individuals, genotyped for 9,908 and 73,045 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, respectively, and phenotyped for five agronomic traits each. DL depends on numerous parameters that influence performance and optimizing hyperparameter values can be a critical step. Here we show that interactions between hyperparameter combinations should be expected and that the number of convolutional filters and regularization in the first layers can have an important effect on model performance. In terms of genomic prediction, we did not find an advantage of DL over linear model methods, except when the epistasis component was important. Linear Bayesian models were better than convolutional neural networks for the full additive architecture, whereas the opposite was observed under strong epistasis. However, by using a parameterization capable of taking into account these non-linear effects, Bayesian linear models can match or exceed the predictive accuracy of DL. A semiautomatic implementation of the DL pipeline is available at https://github.com/lauzingaretti/deepGP/..

AB Background and Objectives: Thyroid nodules are lumps of solid or liquid-filled tumors that form inside the thyroid gland, which can be malignant or benign. Our aim was to test whether the described features of the Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) could improve radiologists' decision making when integrated into a computer system. In this study, we developed a computer-aided diagnosis system integrated into multiple-instance learning (MIL) that would focus on benign-malignant classification. Data were available from the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. Materials and Methods: There were 99 cases (33 Benign and 66 malignant). In this study, the median filter and image binarization were used for image pre-processing and segmentation. The grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) was used to extract seven ultrasound image features. These data were divided into 87% training and 13% validation sets. We compared the support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) classification algorithms based on their accuracy score, sensitivity, and specificity. The outcome measure was whether the thyroid nodule was benign or malignant. We also developed a graphic user interface (GUI) to display the image features that would help radiologists with decision making. Results: ANN and SVM achieved an accuracy of 75% and 96% respectively. SVM outperformed all the other models on all performance metrics, achieving higher accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity score. Conclusions: Our study suggests promising results from MIL in thyroid cancer detection. Further testing with external data is required before our classification model can be employed in practice.

AB We propose a convolutional recurrent neural network (ConvRNNs), with winner-take-all (WTA) dropout for high-dimensional unsupervised feature learning in multidimensional time series. We apply the proposed method for object recognition using temporal context in videos and obtain better results than comparable methods in the literature, including the deep predictive coding networks (DPCNs) previously proposed by Chalasani and Principe. Our contributions can be summarized as a scalable reinterpretation of the DPCNs trained end-to-end with backpropagation through time, an extension of the previously proposed WTA autoencoders to sequences in time, and a new technique for initializing and regularizing ConvRNNs.

AB Transformer model architectures have revolutionized the natural language processing (NLP) domain and continue to produce state-of-the-art results in text-based applications. Prior to the emergence of transformers, traditional NLP models such as recurrent and convolutional neural networks demonstrated promising utility for patient-level predictions and health forecasting from longitudinal datasets. However, to our knowledge only few studies have explored transformers for predicting clinical outcomes from electronic health record (EHR) data, and in our estimation, none have adequately derived a health-specific tokenization scheme to fully capture the heterogeneity of EHR systems. In this study, we propose a dynamic method for tokenizing both discrete and continuous patient data, and present a transformer-based classifier utilizing a joint embedding space for integrating disparate temporal patient measurements. We demonstrate the feasibility of our clinical AI framework through multi-task ICU patient acuity estimation, where we simultaneously predict six mortality and readmission outcomes. Our longitudinal EHR tokenization and transformer modeling approaches resulted in more accurate predictions compared with baseline machine learning models, which suggest opportunities for future multimodal data integrations and algorithmic support tools using clinical transformer networks.

AB OBJECTIVE: Laparoscopic surgical skill assessment and machine learning are often inaccessible to low -and -middle -income countries (LMIC). Our team developed a low-cost laparoscopic training system to teach and assess psychomotor skills required in laparoscopic salpingostomy in LMICs. We performed video review using AI to assess global surgical techniques. The objective of this study was to assess the validity of artificial intelligence (AI) generated scoring measures of laparoscopic simulation videos by comparing the accuracy of AI results to human -generated scores. DESIGN: Seventy-four surgical simulation videos were collected and graded by human participants using a modified OSATS (Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills). The videos were then analyzed via AI using 3 different time and distance -based calculations of the laparoscopic instruments including path length, dimensionless jerk, and standard deviation of tool position. Predicted scores were generated using 5 -fold cross validation and K -Nearest -Neighbors to train classifiers. SETTING: Surgical novices and experts from a variety of hospitals in Ethiopia, Cameroon, Kenya, and the United States contributed 74 laparoscopic salpingostomy simulation videos. RESULTS: Complete accuracy of AI compared to human assessment ranged from 65-77%. There were no statistical differences in rank mean scores for 3 domains, Flow of Operation, Respect for Tissue, and Economy of Motion, while there were significant differences in ratings for Instrument Handling, Overall Performance, and the total summed score of all 5 domains (Summed). Estimated effect sizes were all less than 0.11, indicating very small practical effect. Estimated intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of Summed was 0.72 indicating moderate correlation between AI and Human scores. CONCLUSIONS: Video review using AI technology of global characteristics was similar to that of human review in our laparoscopic training system. Machine learning may help fill an educational gap in LMICs where direct apprenticeship may not be feasible. ( J Surg Ed 81:267-274. (c) 2023 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

TI ERROR COMPENSATION IN MACHINE-TOOLS - A NEURAL-NETWORK APPROACH
SO JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING

DE MACHINE TOOLS; ERROR COMPENSATION; NEURAL NETWORK
AB For a non-idealized machine tool, each point in the workspace is associated with a tool point positioning error vector. If this error map can be determined, then it is possible to substantially improve the positioning performance of the machine by introducing suitable compensation into the control loop. This paper explores the possibility of using an artifical neural network (ANN) to compute this mapping. The training set for the ANN is obtained by mounting a physical artifact whose dimensions are precisely known in the machine's workspace. The machine, equipped with a touch trigger probe, 'measures' the positions of features on the artifact. The difference between the machine reading and the known dimension is the machine error at that point in the workspace. Using standard modeling techniques, the kinematic error model for a CNC turning center was developed. This model was parameterized by measurement of the parametric error functions using a laser interferometer, electronic levels and a precision square. The kinematic model was then used to simulate the artifact-measuring process and develop the ANN training set. The effect of changing artifact geometry was explored and a machining operation was simulated using the ANN output to provide compensation. The results show that the ANN is capable of learning the error map of a real machine, and that ANN-based compensation can significantly reduce part-dimensional errors.

AB The ability to accurately and efficiently compute quantum-mechanical partial atomistic charges has many practical applications, such as calculations of IR spectra, analysis of chemical bonding, and classical force field parametrization. Machine learning (ML) techniques provide a possible avenue for the efficient prediction of atomic partial charges. Modern ML advances in the prediction of molecular energies [i.e., the hierarchical interacting particle neural network (HIP-NN)] has provided the necessary model framework and architecture to predict transferable, extensible, and conformationally dynamic atomic partial charges based on reference density functional theory (DFT) simulations. Utilizing HIP-NN, we show that ML charge prediction can be highly accurate over a wide range of molecules (both small and large) across a variety of charge partitioning schemes such as the Hirshfeld, CMS, MSK, and NBO methods. To demonstrate transferability and size extensibility, we compare ML results with reference DFT calculations on the COMP6 benchmark, achieving errors of 0.004e(-) (elementary charge). This is remarkable since this benchmark contains two proteins that are multiple times larger than the largest molecules in the training set. An application of our atomic charge predictions on nonequilibrium geometries is the generation of IR spectra for organic molecules from dynamical trajectories on a variety of organic molecules, which show good agreement with calculated IR spectra with reference method. Critically, HIP-NN charge predictions are many orders of magnitude faster than direct DFT calculations. These combined results provide further evidence that ML (specifically HIP-NN) provides a pathway to greatly increase the range of feasible simulations while retaining quantum-level accuracy.

AB The ongoing explosion of interest in artificial intelligence is fueled in part by recently developed techniques in machine learning. Those techniques allow automated systems to process huge amounts of data, utilizing mathematical methods that depart from traditional statistical approaches, and resulting in impressive advancements in our ability to make predictions and uncover correlations across a host of interesting domains. But as is now widely discussed, the way that those systems arrive at their outputs is often opaque, even to the experts who design and deploy them. Is it morally problematic to make use of opaque automated methods when making high-stakes decisions, like whether to issue a loan to an applicant, or whether to approve a parole request? Many scholars answer in the affirmative. However, there is no widely accepted explanation for why transparent systems are morally preferable to opaque systems. We argue that the use of automated decision-making systems sometimes violates duties of consideration that are owed by decision-makers to decision-subjects, duties that are both epistemic and practical in character. Violations of that kind generate a weighty consideration against the use of opaque decision systems. In the course of defending our approach, we show that it is able to address three major challenges sometimes leveled against attempts to defend the moral import of transparency in automated decision-making.

TI Prediction of thermally induced time-variant machine tool error maps
   using a Fuzzy ARTMAP neural network
SO JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME
LA English
DT Article
AB A novel approach to on-line learning and prediction of time-variant machine tool error maps is proposed. These error maps are measured using a fast calibration device called the laser ball-bar (LBB) that directly measures the total positioning errors at the cutting tool using trilateration. The learning and prediction of these error maps is achieved using a Fuzzy ARTMAP neural network by treating the problem as an incremental approximation of a functional mapping between thermal sensor readings and the associated positional errors at each location of the cutting tool. Experimental measurements of the positional errors for a two axis turning center were performed using the LBB over two separate thermal duty cycles. The Fuzzy ARTMAP was trained on-line using the data collected over the first thermal duty cycle, which simulated machining of large workpieces with several hours of machining, inspection and set-up time. The network was made to predict the error map of the machine for a new thermal duty cycle that simulated machining of a range of short and long workpieces with shorter machining and set-up times. Results of these predictions show that the LBB and Fuzzy ARTMAP combination is a fast and accurate method for real-time error compensation in machine tools. This method overcomes drawbacks in currently methodologies including high cost and excessive downtime to calibrate machine tools. Application of the Fuzzy ARTMAP to continuous process improvement is discussed.

AB Despite their great success in practical applications, there is still a lack of theoretical and systematic methods to analyze deep neural networks. In this paper, we illustrate an advanced information theoretic methodology to understand the dynamics of learning and the design of autoencoders, a special type of deep learning architectures that resembles a communication channel. By generalizing the information plane to any cost function, and inspecting the roles and dynamics of different layers using layer-wise information quantities, we emphasize the role that mutual information plays in quantifying learning from data. We further suggest and also experimentally validate, for mean square error training, three fundamental properties regarding the layer-wise flow of information and intrinsic dimensionality of the bottleneck layer, using respectively the data processing inequality and the identification of a bifurcation point in the information plane that is controlled by the given data. Our observations have direct impact on the optimal design of autoencoders, the design of alternative feedforward training methods, and even in the problem of generalization. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The Cosmology and Astrophysics with Machine Learning Simulations (CAMELS) project was developed to combine cosmology with astrophysics through thousands of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and machine learning. CAMELS contains 4233 cosmological simulations, 2049 N-body simulations, and 2184 state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations that sample a vast volume in parameter space. In this paper, we present the CAMELS public data release, describing the characteristics of the CAMELS simulations and a variety of data products generated from them, including halo, subhalo, galaxy, and void catalogs, power spectra, bispectra, Lya spectra, probability distribution functions, halo radial profiles, and X-rays photon lists. We also release over 1000 catalogs that contain billions of galaxies from CAMELS-SAM: a large collection of N-body simulations that have been combined with the Santa Cruz semianalytic model. We release all the data, comprising more than 350 terabytes and containing 143,922 snapshots, millions of halos, galaxies, and summary statistics. We provide further technical details on how to access, download, read, and process the data at .

AB While a number of practical methods for training quantized DL models have been presented in the literature, there exists a critical gap in the theoretical generalizability results for such approaches. Although empirical evidence often suggests a high tolerance of DL architectures to variations of training procedures, existing theoretical generalization analyses are often contingent on the specific designs of training algorithms, e.g., in stochastic gradient descent (SGD). This specialization makes such generalizability results inapplicable to the case of quantized DL models. In view of this critical vacuum, this paper provides several almost -algorithm-independent results to ensure the generalizability of a quantized neural network at different levels of optimality. These results include the characterizations of a computable, quantized local solution that ensures the generalization performance and an algorithm that is provably convergent to such a local solution.

AB Knowledge about the internal physical structure of stars is crucial to understanding their evolution. The novel binary population synthesis code POSYDON includes a module for interpolating the stellar and binary properties of any system at the end of binary MESA evolution based on a pre-computed set of models. In this work, we present anew emulation method for predicting stellar profiles, i.e., the internal stellar structure along the radial axis, using machine learning techniques. We use principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction and fully-connected feed-forward neural networks for making predictions. We find accuracy to be comparable to that of nearest neighbor approximation, with a strong advantage in terms of memory and storage efficiency. By providing a versatile framework for modeling stellar internal structure, the emulation method presented here will enable faster simulations of higher physical fidelity, offering a foundation fora wide range of large-scale population studies of stellar and binary evolution.

AB Over the last decades, significant strides were made in understanding the biochemical factors influencing the nutritional content and flavor profile of fruits and vegetables. Product differentiation in the produce aisle is the natural consequence of increasing consumer power in the food industry. Cotton-candy grapes, specialty tomatoes, and pineapple-flavored white strawberries provide a few examples. Given the increased demand for flavorful varieties, and pressing need to reduce micronutrient malnutrition, we expect breeding to increase its prioritization toward these traits. Reaching this goal will, in part, necessitate knowledge of the genetic architecture controlling these traits, as well as the development of breeding methods that maximize their genetic gain. Can artificial intelligence (AI) help predict flavor preferences, and can such insights be leveraged by breeding programs? In this Perspective, we outline both the opportunities and challenges for the development of more flavorful and nutritious crops, and how AI can support these breeding initiatives.

AB Estimating the data density is one of the challenging problem topics in the deep learning society. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective methodology for estimating the data density using the Donsker-Varadhan variational lower bound on the KL divergence and the modeling based on the deep neural network. We demonstrate that the optimal critic function associated with the Donsker-Varadhan representation on the KL divergence between the data and the uniform distribution can estimate the data density. Also, we present the deep neural network-based modeling and its stochastic learning procedure. The experimental results and possible applications of the proposed method demonstrate that it is competitive with the previous methods for data density estimation and has a lot of possibilities for various applications.

AB The objective of this study is to use a deep-learning model based on CNN architecture to detect the second mesiobuccal (MB2) canals, which are seen as a variation in maxillary molars root canals. In the current study, 922 axial sections from 153 patients' cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images were used. The segmentation method was employed to identify the MB2 canals in maxillary molars that had not previously had endodontic treatment. Labeled images were divided into training (80%), validation (10%) and testing (10%) groups. The artificial intelligence (AI) model was trained using the You Only Look Once v5 (YOLOv5x) architecture with 500 epochs and a learning rate of 0.01. Confusion matrix and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were used in the statistical evaluation of the results. The sensitivity of the MB2 canal segmentation model was 0.92, the precision was 0.83, and the F1 score value was 0.87. The area under the curve (AUC) in the ROC graph of the model was 0.84. The mAP value at 0.5 inter-over union (IoU) was found as 0.88. The deep-learning algorithm used showed a high success in the detection of the MB2 canal. The success of the endodontic treatment can be increased and clinicians' time can be preserved using the newly created artificial intelligence-based models to identify variations in root canal anatomy before the treatment.

AB This article provides an in-depth look at how K-12 students should be introduced to Machine Learning and the knowledge and skills they will develop as a result. We begin with an overview of the AI4K12 Initiative, which is developing national guidelines for teaching AI in K-12, and briefly discuss each of the "Five Big Ideas in AI" that serve as the organizing framework for the guidelines. We then discuss the general format and structure of the guidelines and grade band progression charts and provide a theoretical framework that highlights the developmental appropriateness of the knowledge and skills we want to impart to students and the learning experiences we expect them to engage in. Development of the guidelines is informed by best practices from Learning Sciences and CS Education research, and by the need for alignment with CSTA's K-12 Computer Science Standards, Common Core standards, and Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). The remainder of the article provides an in-depth exploration of the AI4K12 Big Idea 3 (Learning) grade band progression chart to unpack the concepts we expect students to master at each grade band. We present examples to illustrate the progressions from two perspectives: horizontal (across grade bands) and vertical (across concepts for a given grade band). Finally, we discuss how these guidelines can be used to create learning experiences that make connections across the Five Big Ideas, and free online tools that facilitate these experiences.

AB An ENsemble Deep Learning Optimal Treatment (EndLot) approach is proposed for personalized medicine problems. The statistical framework of the proposed method is based on the outcome weighted learning (OWL) framework which transforms the optimal decision rule problem into a weighted classification problem. We further employ an ensemble of deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn the optimal decision rule. Utilizing the flexibility of DNNs and the stability of bootstrap aggregation, the proposed method achieves a considerable improvement over existing methods. An R package "ITRlearn" is developed to implement the proposed method. Numerical performance is demonstrated via simulation studies and a real data analysis of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia data.

AB Fish adaption behaviors in complex environments are of great importance in improving the performance of underwater vehicles. This work presents a numerical study of the adaption behaviors of self-propelled fish in complex environments by developing a numerical framework of deep learning and immersed boundary-lattice Boltzmann method (IB-LBM). In this framework, the fish swimming in a viscous incompressible flow is simulated with an IB-LBM which is validated by conducting two benchmark problems including a uniform flow over a stationary cylinder and a self-propelled anguilliform swimming in a quiescent flow. Furthermore, a deep recurrent Q-network (DRQN) is incorporated with the IB-LBM to train the fish model to adapt its motion to optimally achieve a specific task, such as prey capture, rheotaxis and Karman gaiting. Compared to existing learning models for fish, this work incorporates the fish position, velocity and acceleration into the state space in the DRQN; and it considers the amplitude and frequency action spaces as well as the historical effects. This framework makes use of the high computational efficiency of the IB-LBM which is of crucial importance for the effective coupling with learning algorithms. Applications of the proposed numerical framework in point-to-point swimming in quiescent flow and position holding both in a uniform stream and a Karman vortex street demonstrate the strategies used to adapt to different situations.

AB The precise pathophysiology, prevention and treatment of what is commonly diagnosed as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) disease has been elusive. This bears at least partial responsibility for lack of progress in preventative strategies. A clear unambiguous definition that represents a discrete disease is not currently available and likely is a major component of difficulties with understanding a discrete pathophysiology. It is thus becoming increasingly clear that our current paradigm of NEC as a distinct disease is incorrect and the ambiguity in what is being referred to as NEC may be a reason for our lack of progress in prevention. Because of this, we need to critically review our current concepts, how they have evolved in the past several decades and determine how we can best re-evaluate intestinal injuries and dysfunctions that are currently being called NEC. In this review, we discuss historical aspects of NEC as well as our current concepts and a potential pathway using newly developed artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) and multiomic integrations for a paradigm shift that will alter our strategies for early prediction, diagnostics, prevention, and treatment of the various forms of intestinal injury and dysfunction currently referred to as NEC. This will represent a major challenge but is critical if we are to make progress.

AB This tutorial paper surveys provably optimal alternatives to end-to-end backpropagation (E2EBP) - the de facto standard for training deep architectures. Modular training refers to strictly local training without both the forward and the backward pass, i.e., dividing a deep architecture into several nonoverlapping modules and training them separately without any end-to-end operation. Between the fully global E2EBP and the strictly local modular training, there are weakly modular hybrids performing training without the backward pass only. These alternatives can match or surpass the performance of E2EBP on challenging datasets such as ImageNet, and are gaining increasing attention primarily because they offer practical advantages over E2EBP, which will be enumerated herein. In particular, they allow for greater modularity and transparency in deep learning workflows, aligning deep learning with the mainstream computer science engineering that heavily exploits modularization for scalability. Modular training has also revealed novel insights about learning and has further implications on other important research domains. Specifically, it induces natural and effective solutions to some important practical problems such as data efficiency and transferability estimation.

DT Article
ID OF-THE-ART; INFORMATION EXTRACTION; RECOGNITION
AB IntroductionEarly detection of adverse drug events (ADEs) from electronic health records is an important, challenging task to support pharmacovigilance and drug safety surveillance. A well-known challenge to use clinical text for detection of ADEs is that much of the detailed information is documented in a narrative manner. Clinical natural language processing (NLP) is the key technology to extract information from unstructured clinical text.ObjectiveWe present a machine learning-based clinical NLP systemMADExfor detecting medications, ADEs, and their relations from clinical notes.MethodsWe developed a recurrent neural network (RNN) model using a long short-term memory (LSTM) strategy for clinical name entity recognition (NER) and compared it with baseline conditional random fields (CRFs). We also developed a modified training strategy for the RNN, which outperformed the widely used early stop strategy. For relation extraction, we compared support vector machines (SVMs) and random forests on single-sentence relations and cross-sentence relations. In addition, we developed an integrated pipeline to extract entities and relations together by combining RNNs and SVMs.ResultsMADEx achieved the top-three best performances (F1 score of 0.8233) for clinical NER in the 2018 Medication and Adverse Drug Events (MADE1.0) challenge. The post-challenge evaluation showed that the relation extraction module and integrated pipeline (identify entity and relation together) of MADEx are comparable with the best systems developed in this challenge.ConclusionThis study demonstrated the efficiency of deep learning methods for automatic extraction of medications, ADEs, and their relations from clinical text to support pharmacovigilance and drug safety surveillance.

AB A core goal of the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) is to measure changes in biodiversity across the 30-yr horizon of the network. In contrast to NEON's extensive use of automated instruments to collect environmental data, NEON's biodiversity surveys are almost entirely conducted using traditional human-centric field methods. We believe that the combination of instrumentation for remote data collection and machine learning models to process such data represents an important opportunity for NEON to expand the scope, scale, and usability of its biodiversity data collection while potentially reducing long-term costs. In this manuscript, we first review the current status of instrument-based biodiversity surveys within the NEON project and previous research at the intersection of biodiversity, instrumentation, and machine learning at NEON sites. We then survey methods that have been developed at other locations but could potentially be employed at NEON sites in future. Finally, we expand on these ideas in five case studies that we believe suggest particularly fruitful future paths for automated biodiversity measurement at NEON sites: acoustic recorders for sound-producing taxa, camera traps for medium and large mammals, hydroacoustic and remote imagery for aquatic diversity, expanded remote and ground-based measurements for plant biodiversity, and laboratory-based imaging for physical specimens and samples in the NEON biorepository. Through its data science-literate staff and user community, NEON has a unique role to play in supporting the growth of such automated biodiversity survey methods, as well as demonstrating their ability to help answer key ecological questions that cannot be answered at the more limited spatiotemporal scales of human-driven surveys.

The main objective of this review is to illustrate the state-of-art of big data in healthcare, its features and architecture. We also would like to demonstrate the different application and principal mechanisms of big data in the latest technologies known as blockchain and artificial intelligence, recognizing their benefits and limitations. Perhaps, medical education and digital anatomy are unexplored fields that might be profitable to investigate as we are proposing. The healthcare system can be revolutionized using these different technologies. Thus, we are explaining the basis of these systems focused to the medical arena in order to encourage medical doctors, nurses, biotechnologies and other healthcare professions to be involved and create a more efficient and efficacy system.

AB In this study, we combine a fluorescence imaging technique and two machine-learning methods to discriminate Huanglongbing (HLB) disease from zinc-deficiency stress on samples from Florida, USA. Two classification methods, support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN), are used. Our classification results present high accuracy for both classification methods: 92.8% for SVM and 92.2% for ANN. The results from Florida are also compared to results from Sao Paulo State, Brazil. This comparison indicates that the present technique can be applied to discriminate HLB from zinc deficiency in both states. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America

AB Gold standard genomic datasets severely under-represent non-European populations, leading to inequities and a limited understanding of human disease. Therapeutics and outcomes remain hidden because we lack insights that could be gained from analyzing ancestrally diverse genomic data. To address this significant gap, we present PhyloFrame, a machine learning method for equitable genomic precision medicine. PhyloFrame corrects for ancestral bias by integrating functional interaction networks and population genomics data with transcriptomic training data. Application of PhyloFrame to breast, thyroid, and uterine cancers shows marked improvements in predictive power across all ancestries, less model overfitting, and a higher likelihood of identifying known cancer-related genes. Validation in fourteen ancestrally diverse datasets demonstrates that PhyloFrame is better able to adjust for ancestry bias across all populations. The ability to provide accurate predictions for underrepresented groups, in particular, is substantially increased. Analysis of performance in the most diverse continental ancestry group, African, illustrates how phylogenetic distance from training data negatively impacts model performance, as well as PhyloFrame's capacity to mitigate these effects. These results demonstrate how equitable artificial intelligence (AI) approaches can mitigate ancestral bias in training data and contribute to equitable representation in medical research.

TI DeepPerVar: a multi-modal deep learning framework for functional
   interpretation of genetic variants in personal genome

DT Article

   DISCOVERY
AB Motivation: Understanding the functional consequence of genetic variants, especially the non-coding ones, is important but particularly challenging. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or quantitative trait locus analyses may be subject to limited statistical power and linkage disequilibrium, and thus are less optimal to pinpoint the causal variants. Moreover, most existing machine-learning approaches, which exploit the functional annotations to interpret and prioritize putative causal variants, cannot accommodate the heterogeneity of personal genetic variations and traits in a population study, targeting a specific disease.
   Results: By leveraging paired whole-genome sequencing data and epigenetic functional assays in a population study, we propose a multi-modal deep learning framework to predict genome-wide quantitative epigenetic signals by considering both personal genetic variations and traits. The proposed approach can further evaluate the functional consequence of non-coding variants on an individual level by quantifying the allelic difference of predicted epigenetic signals. By applying the approach to the ROSMAP cohort studying Alzheimer's disease (AD), we demonstrate that the proposed approach can accurately predict quantitative genome-wide epigenetic signals and in key genomic regions of AD causal genes, learn canonical motifs reported to regulate gene expression of AD causal genes, improve the partitioning heritability analysis and prioritize putative causal variants in a GWAS risk locus. Finally, we release the proposed deep learning model as a stand-alone Python toolkit and a web server.

AB The fast and accurate diagnosis of power quality disturbances (PQD) aids in avoiding shutdowns and unnecessary procedures, concerning electric energy distribution systems. As such, a number of techniques have been tested and applied in order to reach this objective. Majority of the techniques applied are two-step based. On the first step, power quality disturbances features are extracted. Second step, considering features extracted, disturbance classification is implemented. Recently, relevant literature has presented data-driven signal processing-based approaches, as deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN), which can implement both processing steps while providing automated recognition of patterns and outliers in data. However, not considered by state-of-art, power quality disturbances are evolving in nature, while all possible regularities might not be represented in the dataset. In this work a 2 Dimension Densely Connected Convolutional Network (2D-DenseNet) framework is presented. Case study with synthetic disturbance events are analyzed. Easy-to-implement formulation, built on the 2D-DenseNet, without hard-to-design parameters, highlight potential aspects for real-life implementation.

AB Seed coat sculptures, including anticlinal and periclinal walls, are of great taxonomic importance. In this study, we identified seed coat patterns of Allium seeds using five deep learning methods namely, CNN, AlexNet, GoogleNet, ResNet50, and VGG16 for the first time. Selected images of seed coat patterns from over 100 Allium species reported in previously published literature and data from our samples were classified into seven types of anticlinal (irregular curved, irregular curved to nearly straight, straight, S, U, UO, and omega) and five types of periclinal walls (granule, small verruca, large verruca, marginal verruca, and verrucate verruca). The results revealed that GoogleNet and VGG16 achieved the highest classification accuracy of 90.4% for the anticlinal wall, and VGG16 achieved the highest classification accuracy of 98.1% for the periclinal wall. Moreover, more than three, four, and five methods were combined, and their performance was investigated. Combining more than three methods was the most advantageous. The models achieved a suitable anticlinal wall classification using GoogleNet and periclinal wall classification using VGG16. In conclusion, using the machine-based method, we studied the seed coat of species of Allium on our own samples to see if the results of the machine-based method match with the human based classification.(c) 2022 National Science Museum of Korea (NSMK) and Korea National Arboretum (KNA), Publishing Services by Elsevier.

AB Advances in artificial intelligence for computer vision hold great promise for increasing the scales at which ecological systems can be studied. The distribution and behavior of individuals is central to ecology, and computer vision using deep neural networks can learn to detect individual objects in imagery. However, developing supervised models for ecological monitoring is challenging because it requires large amounts of human-labeled training data, requires advanced technical expertise and computational infrastructure, and is prone to overfitting. This limits application across space and time. One solution is developing generalized models that can be applied across species and ecosystems. Using over 250,000 annotations from 13 projects from around the world, we develop a general bird detection model that achieves over 65% recall and 50% precision on novel aerial data without any local training despite differences in species, habitat, and imaging methodology. Fine-tuning this model with only 1000 local annotations increases these values to an average of 84% recall and 69% precision by building on the general features learned from other data sources. Retraining from the general model improves local predictions even when moderately large annotation sets are available and makes model training faster and more stable. Our results demonstrate that general models for detecting broad classes of organisms using airborne imagery are achievable. These models can reduce the effort, expertise, and computational resources necessary for automating the detection of individual organisms across large scales, helping to transform the scale of data collection in ecology and the questions that can be addressed.

AB Background: Patients with skin lesions suspicious for skin cancer or atypical melanocytic nevi of uncertain malignant potential often present to dermatologists, who may have variable dermoscopy triage clinical experience. Objective: To evaluate the clinical utility of a digital dermoscopy image-based artificial intelligence algorithm (DDI-AI device) on the diagnosis and management of skin cancers by dermatologists. Methods: Thirty-six United States board-certified dermatologists evaluated 50 clinical images and 50 digital dermoscopy images of the same skin lesions (25 malignant and 25 benign), first without and then with knowledge of the DDI-AI device output. Participants indicated whether they thought the lesion was likely benign (unremarkable) or malignant (suspicious). Results: The management sensitivity of dermatologists using the DDI-AI device was 91.1%, compared to 84.3% with DDI, and 70.0% with clinical images. The management specificity was 71.0%, compared to 68.4% and 64.9%, respectively. The diagnostic sensitivity of dermatologists using the DDI-AI device was 86.1%, compared to 78.8% with DDI, and 63.4% with clinical images. Diagnostic specificity using the DDI-AI device increased to 80.7%, compared to 75.9% and 73.6%, respectively. Conclusion: The use of the DDI-AI device may quickly, safely, and effectively improve dermoscopy performance, skin cancer diagnosis, and management when used by dermatologists, independent of training and experience.

AB Pseudoexfoliation (PEX) is a known cause of secondary open angle glaucoma. PEX glaucoma is associated with structural and metabolic changes in the eye. Despite similarities, PEX and primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) may have differences in the composition of metabolites. We analyzed the metabolites of the aqueous humor (AH) of PEX subjects sequentially first using nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR: HSQC and TOCSY), and subsequently with liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) implementing isotopic ratio outlier analysis (IROA) quantification. The findings were compared with previous results for POAG and control subjects analyzed using identical sequential steps. We found significant differences in metabolites between the three conditions. Principle component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) indicated clear grouping based on the metabolomes of the three conditions. We used machine learning algorithms and a percentage set of the data to train, and utilized a different or larger dataset to test whether a trained model can correctly classify the test dataset as PEX, POAG or control. Three different algorithms: linear support vector machines (SVM), deep learning, and a neural network were used for prediction. They all accurately classified the test datasets based on the AH metabolome of the sample. We next compared the AH metabolome with known AH and TM proteomes and genomes in order to understand metabolic pathways that may contribute to alterations in the AH metabolome in PEX. We found potential protein/gene pathways associated with observed significant metabolite changes in PEX.

AB Deep Treatment Learning (deepTL), a robust yet efficient deep learning-based semiparametric regression approach, is proposed to adjust the complex confounding structures in comparative effectiveness analysis of observational data, for example, electronic health record (EHR) data in which complex confounding structures are often embedded. Specifically, we develop a deep learning neural network with a score-based ensembling scheme for flexible function approximation. An improved semiparametric procedure is further developed to enhance the performance of the proposed method under finite sample settings. Comprehensive numerical studies have demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed methods, as compared with existing methods, with a remarkably reduced bias and mean squared error in parameter estimates. The proposed research is motivated by a postsurgery pain study, which is also used to illustrate the practical application of deepTL. Finally, an R package, "deepTL," is developed to implement the proposed method.

AB Machine learning (ML) has great potential to drive scientific discovery by harvesting data from images of herbarium specimens preserved plant material curated in natural history collections-but ML techniques have only recently been applied to this rich resource. ML has particularly strong prospects for the study of plant phenological events such as growth and reproduction. As a major indicator of climate change, driver of ecological processes, and critical determinant of plant fitness, plant phenology is an important frontier for the application of ML techniques for science and society. In the present article, we describe a generalized, modular ML workflow for extracting phenological data from images of herbarium specimens, and we discuss the advantages, limitations, and potential future improvements of this workflow. Strategic research and investment in specimen-based ML methods, along with the aggregation of herbarium specimen data, may give rise to a better understanding of life on Earth.

AB Information on ecological systems often comes from diverse sources with varied levels of complexity, bias, and uncertainty. Accordingly, analytical techniques continue to evolve that address these challenges to reveal the characteristics of ecological systems and inform conservation actions. We applied multiple statistical learning algorithms (i.e., machine learning) with a range of information sources including fish tracking data, environmental data, and visual surveys to identify potential spawning aggregation sites for a marine fish species, permit (Trachinotus falcatus), in the Florida Keys. Recognizing the potential complementarity and some level of uncertainty in each information source, we applied supervised (classic and conditional random forests; RF) and unsupervised (fuzzyk-means; FKM) algorithms. The two RF models had similar predictive performance, but generated different predictor variable importance structures and spawning site predictions. Unsupervised clustering using FKM identified unique site groupings that were similar to the likely spawning sites identified with RF. The conservation of aggregate spawning fish species depends heavily on the protection of key spawning sites; many of these potential sites were identified here for permit in the Florida Keys, which consisted of relatively deep-water natural and artificial reefs with high mean permit residency periods. The application of multiple machine learning algorithms enabled the integration of diverse information sources to develop models of an ecological system. Faced with increasingly complex and diverse data sources, ecologists, and conservation practitioners should find increasing value in machine learning algorithms, which we discuss here and provide resources to increase accessibility.

AB Transfer learning can replace the long and costly data collection, labeling and training session by effective and the most efficient representations. BERT, trained by Google, is a language representation generator and is far more global to be effectively determine the representations of natural languages and create the numerical version of grammatical structures and inter-dependencies of language attributes. In this work, we introduced recurrent BERT network and singular BERT network and have demonstrated the effective way of utilization of BERT for applications like parts-of-speech tagging and phrase tagging, which are integral part of understanding languages structure and interpretation of message. We have achieved extraordinarily high accuracy for prediction with these models and have done a comparative study using different datasets and is aimed at applications related to sentence generation. We created an accuracy of 96.65% for parts-of-speech detection and 95.24% for phrase prediction for Penn Tree Bank sentences and 99.64% and 97.94% for MSCOCO dataset sentences. Different origin sentences will ensure that while human generated sentences are complex for high accuracy and prone to errors, effective machine generated sentence attribute detection provision must be kept open for progress in language understanding.

AB Parkinson's disease is the world's fastest-growing neurological disorder. Research to elucidate the mechanisms of Parkinson's disease and automate diagnostics would greatly improve the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease. Current diagnostic methods are expensive and have limited availability. Considering the insidious and preclinical onset and progression of the disease, a desirable screening should be diagnostically accurate even before the onset of symptoms to allow medical interventions. We highlight retinal fundus imaging, often termed a window to the brain, as a diagnostic screening modality for Parkinson's disease. We conducted a systematic evaluation of conventional machine learning and deep learning techniques to classify Parkinson's disease from UK Biobank fundus imaging. Our results suggest Parkinson's disease individuals can be differentiated from age and gender-matched healthy subjects with 68% accuracy. This accuracy is maintained when predicting either prevalent or incident Parkinson's disease. Explainability and trustworthiness are enhanced by visual attribution maps of localized biomarkers and quantified metrics of model robustness to data perturbations.

AB INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in women, and the incidence rate is increasing year by year. Women in every country in the world may develop breast cancer at any age after puberty. The cause of breast cancer is not fully understood. At present, the main methods of breast cancer detection are inefficient. Researchers are trying to use computer technology to detect breast cancer. But there are some still limitations.METHODS: We propose a network (ODET) to detect breast cancer based on ultrasound images. In this paper, we use ResNet50 as the backbone model. We make some modifications to the backbone model by deep ELM-based transfer learning. After these modifications, the network is named DET. However, DET still has some shortcomings because the parameters in DET are randomly assigned and will not change in the experiment. In this case, we select BA to optimize DET. The optimized DET is named ODET.RESULTS: The proposed ODET gets the F1-score (F1), precision (PRE), specificity (SPE), sensitivity (SEN), and accuracy (ACC) are 93.16%+/- 1.12%, 93.28%+/- 1.36%, 98.63%+/- 0.31%, 93.96%+/- 1.85%, and 97.84%+/- 0.37%, respectively. CONCLUSION: It proves that the proposed ODET is an effective method for breast cancer detection.

AB Priority-dispatching rules have been studied for many decades, and they form the backbone of much industrial scheduling practice. Developing new dispatching rules for a given environment, however, is usually a tedious process involving implementing different rules in a simulation model of the facility under study and evaluating the rule through extensive simulation experiments. In this research, an innovative approach is presented, which is capable of automatically discovering effective dispatching rules. This is a significant step beyond current applications of artificial intelligence to production scheduling, which are mainly based on learning to select a given rule from among a number of candidates rather than identifying new and potentially more effective rules. The proposed approach is evaluated in a variety of single machine environments, and discovers rules that are competitive with those in the literature, which are the results of decades of research.

AB Accurate blueberry fruit phenotyping, including yield, fruit maturity, and cluster compactness, is crucial for optimizing crop breeding and management practices. Recent advances in machine vision and deep learning have shown promising potential to automate phenotyping and replace manual sampling. This paper presented a robotic blueberry phenotyping system, called MARS-Phenobot, that collects data in the field and measures fruit- related phenotypic traits such as fruit number, maturity, and compactness. Our workflow comprised four components: a robotic multi-view imaging system for high-throughput data collection, a vision foundation model (Segment Anything Model, SAM) for mask-free data labeling, a customized BerryNet deep learning model for detecting blueberry clusters and segmenting fruit, as well as a post-processing module for estimating yield, maturity, and cluster compactness. A customized deep learning model, BerryNet, was designed for detecting fruit clusters and segmenting individual berries by integrating low-level pyramid features, rapid partial convolutional blocks, and BiFPN feature fusion. It outperformed other networks and achieved mean average precision (mAP50) of 54.9 % in cluster detection and 85.8 % in fruit segmentation with fewer parameters and fewer computation requirements. We evaluated the phenotypic traits derived from our methods and the ground truth on 26 individual blueberry plants across 17 genotypes. The results demonstrated that both the fruit count and cluster count extracted from images were strongly correlated with the yield. Integrating multi-view fruit counts enhanced yield estimation accuracy, achieving a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 23.1 % and the highest R2 value of 0.73, while maturity level estimations closely aligned with manual calculations, exhibiting a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately 5 %. Furthermore, two metrics related to fruit compactness were introduced, including cluster compactness and fruit distance, which could be useful for breeders to assess the machine and hand harvestability across genotypes. Finally, we evaluated the proposed robotic blueberry fruit phenotyping pipeline on eleven blueberry genotypes, proving the potential to distinguish the high-yield, early-maturity, and loose-clustering cultivars. Our methodology provides a promising solution for automated in-field blueberry fruit phenotyping, potentially replacing labor-intensive manual sampling. Furthermore, this approach could advance blueberry breeding programs, precision management, and mechanical/robotic harvesting.

AB Understanding the diversity of soil organisms is complicated by both scale and substrate. Every footprint we leave in the soil covers hundreds to millions of organisms yet we cannot see them without extremely laborious extraction and microsopy endeavors. Studying them is also challenging. Keeping them alive so that we can understand their lifecycles and ecological roles ranges from difficult to impossible. Functional and taxonomic identification of soil organisms, while possible, is also challenging. Here we present the Smart Soil Organism Detector, an instrument and machine learning pipeline that combines high-resolution imaging, multi-spectral sensing, large-bore flow cytometry, and machine learning to extract, isolate, count, identify, and separate soil organisms in a high-throughput, high-resolution, non-destructive, and reproducible manner. This system is not only capable of separating alive nematodes, dead nematodes, and nematode cuticles from soil with 100% out-of -sample accuracy, but also capable of identifying nematode strains (sub-species) with 95.5% out-of-sample ac-curacy and 99.4% specificity. Soil micro-arthropods were identified to class with 96.1% out-of-sample accuracy. Broadly applicable across soil taxa, the Smart SOD system is a tool for understanding global soil biodiversity.

AB This paper proposes Friedrichs learning as a novel deep learning methodology that can learn the weak solutions of PDEs via a minimax formulation, which transforms the PDE problem into a minimax optimization problem to identify weak solutions. The name "Friedrichs learning" is to highlight the close relation between our learning strategy and Friedrichs theory on symmetric systems of PDEs. The weak solution and the test function in the weak formulation are parameterized as deep neural networks in a mesh-free manner, which are alternately updated to approach the optimal solution networks approximating the weak solution and the optimal test function, respectively. Extensive numerical results indicate that our mesh-free Friedrichs learning method can provide reasonably good solutions for a wide range of PDEs defined on regular and irregular domains, where conventional numerical methods such as finite difference methods and finite element methods may be tedious or difficult to be applied, especially for those with discontinuous solutions in high-dimensional problems.

AB The widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tools across various domains has showcased their remarkable capabilities and performance. Black-box AI models raise concerns about decision transparency and user confidence. Therefore, explainable AI (XAI) and explainability techniques have rapidly emerged in recent years. This paper aims to review existing works on explainability techniques in bioinformatics, with a particular focus on omics and imaging. We seek to analyze the growing demand for XAI in bioinformatics, identify current XAI approaches, and highlight their limitations. Our survey emphasizes the specific needs of both bioinformatics applications and users when developing XAI methods and we particularly focus on omics and imaging data. Our analysis reveals a significant demand for XAI in bioinformatics, driven by the need for transparency and user confidence in decision-making processes. At the end of the survey, we provided practical guidelines for system developers.

AB Recent advances in computing technology in terms of speed, cost, as well as access to tremendous amounts of computing power and the ability to process huge amounts of data in reasonable time has spurred increased interest in data mining applications to extract useful knowledge from data. Machine learning has been one of the methods used in most of these data mining applications. It is widely acknowledged that about 80% of the resources in a majority of data mining applications are spent on cleaning and preprocessing the data. However, there have been relatively few studies on preprocessing data used as input in these data mining systems. In this study, we evaluate several inter-class as well as probabilistic distance-based feature selection methods as to their effectiveness in preprocessing input data for inducing decision trees. We use real-world data to evaluate these feature selection methods. Results from this study show that inter-class distance measures result in better performance compared to probabilistic measures, in general. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) combined with machine learning have a great potential for crop yield estimation. In this study, a UAV equipped with an RGB (Red, Green, Blue) camera and computer vision algorithms were used to estimate coffee tree height and crown diameter, and for the prediction of coffee yield. Data were collected for 144 trees between June 2017 and May 2018, in the Minas Gerais, Brazil. Six parameters (leaf area index -LAI, tree height, crown diameter, and the individual RGB band values) were used to develop UAV-based yield prediction models. First, a feature ranking was performed to identify the most significant parameter(s) and month(s) for data collection and yield prediction. Based on the feature rankings, the LAI and the crown diameter were determined as the most important parameters. Five algorithms were used to develop yield prediction models: (i) linear support vector machines (SVM), (ii) gradient boosting regression (GBR), (iii) random forest regression (RFR), (iv) partial least square regression (PLSR), and (v) neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT). The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was used to evaluate the yield prediction models. The best result was obtained by the NEAT algorithm (MAPE of 31.75%) for a reduced dataset containing only the most important features (LAI and the crown diameter) and the most important months (December 2017 and April 2018). The results suggest that a dataset of the most important month (December) could be used for the yield prediction model, reducing the need for extensive data collection (e.g., monthly data collection).

AB In this study, we developed a machine learning interatomic potential based on artificial neural networks (ANN) to model carbon-hydrogen (C-H) systems. The ANN potential was trained on a dataset of C-H clusters obtained through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Through comprehensive evaluations against DFT results, including predictions of geometries and formation energies across 0D-3D systems comprising C and C-H, as well as modeling various chemical processes, the ANN potential demonstrated exceptional accuracy and transferability. Its capability to accurately predict lattice dynamics, crucial for stability assessment in crystal structure prediction, was also verified through phonon dispersion analysis. Notably, its accuracy and computational efficiency in calculating force constants facilitated the exploration of complex energy landscapes, leading to the discovery of a novel C polymorph. These results underscore the robustness and versatility of the ANN potential, highlighting its efficacy in advancing computational materials science by conducting precise atomistic simulations on a wide range of C-H materials.

AB Implementing machine-learning models in real applications is crucial to achieving intelligent building control and high energy efficiency. Over the past few decades, numerous studies have attempted to explore the application of machine-learning models to building energy efficiency. However, these studies have focused on analyzing the technical feasibility and superiority of machine learning algorithms for fitting building energyrelated data and have not considered methods of implementing machine learning technology in building energy efficiency applications. Therefore, this review aims to summarize the current practical issues involved in applying machine-learning models to building energy efficiency by systematically analyzing existing research findings and limitations. The paper first reviews the application status of machine learning-based building energy efficiency research by analyzing the model implementation process and summarizing the main uses of the technology in the overall building energy management life cycle. The paper then elaborates on the causes of, influences on, and potential solutions for practical issues found in the implementation and promotion of machine learning-based building energy efficiency measures. Finally, this paper discusses valuable future machine learning-based building energy efficiency research directions with regard to technology opportunity discovery, data governance, feature engineering, generalizability test, technology diffusion, and knowledge sharing. This paper will provide building researchers and practitioners with a better understanding of the current application statuses of and potential research directions for machine learning models in building energy efficiency.

AB Lyapunov-based real-time update laws are well-known for neural network (NN)-based adaptive controllers that control nonlinear dynamical systems using single-hidden-layer NNs. However, developing real-time weight update laws for deep NNs (DNNs) remains an open question. This letter presents the first result with Lyapunov-based real-time weight adaptation laws for each layer of a feedforward DNN-based control architecture, with stability guarantees. Additionally, the developed method allows nonsmooth activation functions to be used in the DNN to facilitate improved transient performance. A nonsmooth Lyapunov-based stability analysis proves global asymptotic tracking error convergence. Simulation results are provided for a nonlinear system using DNNs with leaky rectified linear unit (LReLU) and hyperbolic tangent activation functions to demonstrate the efficacy of the developed method.

AB We propose reproducing activation functions (RAFs) motivated by applied and computational harmonic analysis to improve deep learning accuracy for various applications ranging from computer vision to scientific computing. The idea is to employ several basic functions and their learnable linear combination to construct neuron -wise data -driven activation functions for each neuron. Armed with RAFs, neural networks (NNs) can reproduce traditional approximation tools and, therefore, approximate target functions with a smaller number of parameters than traditional NNs. As demonstrated by extensive numerical tests, the proposed RAFs can facilitate the convergence of deep learning optimization for a solution with higher accuracy than existing deep learning solvers for audio/image/video reconstruction, PDEs, and eigenvalue problems. With RAFs, the errors of audio/video reconstruction, PDEs, and eigenvalue problems are decreased by over 14%, 73%, 99%, respectively, compared with baseline, while the performance of image reconstruction increases by 58%. Numerically, in the NN training, RAFs can generate neural tangent kernels with better condition numbers than traditional activation functions, which provides a prospective for understanding the improved optimization convergence using the theory of neural tangent kernel. The code is available at https://github.com/LeungSamWai/Reproducing-Activation-Function.

AB IntroductionArtificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform oncologic care. There have been significant developments in AI applications in medical imaging and increasing interest in multimodal models. These are likely to enable improved oncologic care through more precise diagnosis, increasingly in a more personalized and less invasive manner. In this review, we provide an overview of the current state and challenges that clinicians, administrative personnel and policy makers need to be aware of and mitigate for the technology to reach its full potential.Areas coveredThe article provides a brief targeted overview of AI, a high-level review of the current state and future potential AI applications in diagnostic radiology and to a lesser extent digital pathology, focusing on oncologic applications. This is followed by a discussion of emerging approaches, including multimodal models. The article concludes with a discussion of technical, regulatory challenges and infrastructure needs for AI to realize its full potential.Expert opinionThere is a large volume of promising research, and steadily increasing commercially available tools using AI. For the most advanced and promising precision diagnostic applications of AI to be used clinically, robust and comprehensive quality monitoring systems and informatics platforms will likely be required.

AB In recent years, as the main carrier of deep learning, Deep Neural Network has attracted the attention of experts in computer field. The application of deep neural network can effectively solve complex problems in life. However, in the process of training, the complex relationship caused by noisy data leads to an overfitting, which can impact the robustness of network model. Dropout, as one kind of random regularization techniques, carries a significant effect on restraining the overfitting of deep neural network. The traditional standard dropout can restrain the overfitting in a simple and quick way, but the accuracy is impacted because it cannot accurately locate the appropriate scale. This paper proposes a multi-scale fusion (MSF) dropout method on the basis of standard dropout. At first, several groups of network model with different combinations of dropout rates were trained; then the improved genetic algorithm was used to calculate the optimal scale of each network model; by reducing the corresponding network parameters through the optimal scale, the prediction sub-models were obtained; finally, these sub-models are fused into a final prediction model with certain weight. The present study applies MSF dropout to carry out the experiments in MNIST and CIFAR-10 standard datasets. The result of the study shows that the prediction accuracy is significantly improved compared with the other two kinds of dropout, which verifies the effectiveness of the multi-scale fusion method.

AB Over the last decade, the number of cyber attacks targeting power systems and causing physical and economic damages has increased rapidly. Among them, false data injection attacks (FDIAs) are a class of cyber-attacks against power grid monitoring systems. Adversaries can successfully perform FDIAs to manipulate the power system state estimation (SE) by compromising sensors or modifying system data. SE is an essential process performed by the energy management system towards estimating unknown state variables based on system redundant measurements and network topology. SE routines include bad data detection algorithms to eliminate errors from the acquired measurements, e.g. in case of sensor failures. FDIAs can bypass BDD modules to inject malicious data vectors into a subset of measurements without being detected, and thus manipulate the results of the SE process. To overcome the limitations of traditional residual-based BDD approaches, data-driven solutions based on machine learning algorithms have been widely adopted for detecting malicious manipulation of sensor data due to their fast execution times and accurate results. This study provides a comprehensive review of the most up-to-date machine learning methods for detecting FDIAs against power system SE algorithms.

AB Context information is rarely used in the object-based landcover classification. Previous models that attempted to utilize this information usually required the user to input empirical values for critical model parameters, leading to less optimal performance. Multi-view image information is useful for improving classification accuracy, but the methods to assimilate multi-view information to make it usable for context driven models have not been explored in the literature. Here we propose a novel method to exploit the multi-view information for generating class membership probability. Moreover, we develop a new conditional random field model to integrate multi-view information and context information to further improve landcover classification accuracy. This model does not require the user to manually input parameters because all parameters in the Conditional Random Field (CRF) model are fully learned from the training dataset using the gradient descent approach. Using multi-view data extracted from small Unmanned Aerial Systems (UASs), we experimented with Gaussian Mixed Model (GMM), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) classifiers to test model performance. The results showed that our model improved average overall accuracies from 58.3% to 74.7% for the GMM classifier, 75.8% to 87.3% for the RF classifier, 75.0% to 84.4% for the SVM classifier and 80.3% to 86.3% for the DCNN classifier. Although the degree of improvement may depend on the specific classifier respectively, the proposed model can significantly improve classification accuracy irrespective of classifier type.

AB Adaptive immune receptor repertoires (AIRR) are key targets for biomedical research as they record past and ongoing adaptive immune responses. The capacity of machine learning (ML) to identify complex discriminative sequence patterns renders it an ideal approach for AIRR-based diagnostic and therapeutic discovery. So far, widespread adoption of AIRR ML has been inhibited by a lack of reproducibility, transparency and interoperability. immuneML (immuneml.uio.no) addresses these concerns by implementing each step of the AIRR ML process in an extensible, open-source software ecosystem that is based on fully specified and shareable workflows. To facilitate widespread user adoption, immuneML is available as a command-line tool and through an intuitive Galaxy web interface, and extensive documentation of workflows is provided. We demonstrate the broad applicability of immuneML by (1) reproducing a large-scale study on immune state prediction, (2) developing, integrating and applying a novel deep learning method for antigen specificity prediction and (3) showcasing streamlined interpretability-focused benchmarking of AIRR ML.

AB Trucks are the key transporters of freight. The types of commodities and goods mainly determine the right trailer for carrying them. Furthermore, finding the commodities' flow is an important task for transportation agencies in better planning freight infrastructure investments and initiating near-term traffic throughput improvements. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained deep learning based truck classification system that can detect and classify the trucks, tractors, and trailers following the Federal Highway Administration's (FHWA) vehicle schema. We created a large, fine-grained labeled dataset of vehicle images collected from state highways. Experimental results show the high accuracy of our system and visualize the salient features of the trucks that influence classification.

AB Established guidelines describe minimum requirements for reporting algorithms in healthcare; it is equally important to objectify the characteristics of ideal algorithms that confer maximum potential benefits to patients, clinicians, and investigators. We propose a framework for ideal algorithms, including 6 desiderata: explainable (convey the relative importance of features in determining outputs), dynamic (capture temporal changes in physiologic signals and clinical events), precise (use high-resolution, multimodal data and aptly complex architecture), autonomous (learn with minimal supervision and execute without human input), fair (evaluate and mitigate implicit bias and social inequity), and reproducible (validated externally and prospectively and shared with academic communities). We present an ideal algorithms checklist and apply it to highly cited algorithms. Strategies and tools such as the predictive, descriptive, relevant (PDR) framework, the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials-Artificial Intelligence (SPIRIT-AI) extension, sparse regression methods, and minimizing concept drift can help healthcare algorithms achieve these objectives, toward ideal algorithms in healthcare.

AB Printed circuit board (PCB) assurance in the optical domain is a crucial field of study. Though there are many existing PCB assurance methods using image processing, computer vision (CV), and machine learning (ML), the PCB field is complex and increasingly evolving, so new techniques are required to overcome the emerging problems. Existing ML-based methods outperform traditional CV methods; however, they often require more data, have low explainability, and can be difficult to adapt when a new technology arises. To overcome these challenges, CV methods can be used in tandem with ML methods. In particular, human-interpretable CV algorithms such as those that extract color, shape, and texture features increase PCB assurance explainability. This allows for incorporation of prior knowledge, which effectively reduces the number of trainable ML parameters and, thus, the amount of data needed to achieve high accuracy when training or retraining an ML model. Hence, this study explores the benefits and limitations of a variety of common computer vision-based features for the task of PCB component detection. The study results indicate that color features demonstrate promising performance for PCB component detection. The purpose of this paper is to facilitate collaboration between the hardware assurance, computer vision, and machine learning communities.

AB Fluid flow around a random distribution of stationary spherical particles is a problem of substantial importance in the study of dispersed multiphase flows. In this paper, we present a machine learning methodology using generative adversarial network framework and convolutional neural network architecture to recreate particle-resolved fluid flow around a random distribution of monodispersed particles. The model was applied to various Reynolds number and particle volume fraction combinations spanning over a range of [2.69, 172.96] and [0.11, 0.45], respectively. Test performance of the model for the studied cases is very promising.

AB The development of a sustainable water quality monitoring system at national scale remains a big challenge until today, acting as a hindrance for the efficient implementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). This work provides valuable insights into the current state-of-the-art Earth Observation (EO) tools and services, proposing a synergistic use of innovative remote sensing technologies, in situ sensors, and databases, with the ultimate goal to support the European Member States in effective WFD implementation. The proposed approach is based on a recent research and scientific analysis for a six-year period (2017-2022) after reviewing 71 peer-reviewed articles in international journals coupled with the scientific results of 11 European-founded research projects related to EO and WFD. Special focus is placed on the EO data sources (spaceborne, in situ, etc.), the sensors in use, the observed water Quality Elements as well as on the computer science techniques (machine/deep learning, artificial intelligence, etc.). The combination of the different technologies can offer, among other things, low-cost monitoring, an increase in the monitored Quality Elements per water body, and a minimization of the percentage of water bodies with unknown ecological status.

SO PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY

ID NEURAL-NETWORKS
AB A deep learning architecture for predicting the normalized pin powers within 2D pressurized water reactors, called LatticeNet, has been developed and shown to be performant for a variety of relevant conditions within a single 2D reflective assembly. However, many neutronics scenarios of interest involve regions composed of multiple assemblies, up to and including full-core scenarios. It is not immediately obvious that scaling LatticeNet up to these full-core scenarios will achieve the same performance as seen in single-assembly scenarios, due to the problem-tailored nature of neural networks. It is also simple to show that the original implementation of LatticeNet does not easily scale up to multi-assembly regions due to the enormous compute demands of the original proposed architecture. In this work, we address these issues by first proposing several variants of LatticeNet which address the issue of scaling compute needs, and show the theoretical performance benefits gained from these architectures. We then evaluate the actual benefit of the proposed variants on multi-assembly regions containing roughly the same variation outlined in the original paper proposing LatticeNet. We show that the proposed architecture changes do not result in significantly increased error, and that these changes result in much more manageable training times relative to the original LatticeNet architecture.

AB Strawberries, as an indeterminate crop, produce fruit multiple times per season, making fruit monitoring and wave-specific yield prediction essential for optimizing harvest planning. This study developed an AI-driven approach to predict next week's yield using real-time plant image data collected by a machine vision system and environmental data. YOLOv8n was employed to count flowers, immature fruit, and mature fruit per plant, with manual counts used to evaluate the system's accuracy. The YOLOv8n-based data, combined with weather features, were used to train several AI models for yield prediction. These models included traditional time series machine learning approaches, such as Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) with time lag features, Vector Autoregression (VAR), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), Random Forest, and deep learning time-series models, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN). Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) was employed to identify the most relevant features. The performance of these models was evaluated across three strawberry varieties: Sensation, Brilliance, and Medallion. Results showed that MLR outperformed other models for Sensation and Brilliance, with R2 values of 0.633 and 0.908, respectively. For Medallion, GBM achieved the best performance with an R2 score of 0.848. LSTM, which outperformed TCN, achieved R2 scores of 0.522 (Sensation), 0.839 (Brilliance), and 0.740 (Medallion). This AI-driven system automates yield forecasting, reducing labor costs and enabling more efficient harvest planning. The study highlights the potential of combining machine vision and predictive analytics for precise, scalable yield prediction, offering valuable insights for proactive farm management and supply chain optimization.

TI Pathologist-level interpretable whole-slide cancer diagnosis with deep

ID CLASSIFICATION; PROSTATE
AB Diagnostic pathology is the foundation and gold standard for identifying carcinomas. However, high inter-observer variability substantially affects productivity in routine pathology and is especially ubiquitous in diagnostician-deficient medical centres. Despite rapid growth in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), the application of whole-slide pathology diagnosis remains impractical. Here, we present a novel pathology whole-slide diagnosis method, powered by artificial intelligence, to address the lack of interpretable diagnosis. The proposed method masters the ability to automate the human-like diagnostic reasoning process and translate gigapixels directly to a series of interpretable predictions, providing second opinions and thereby encouraging consensus in clinics. Moreover, using 913 collected examples of whole-slide data representing patients with bladder cancer, we show that our method matches the performance of 17 pathologists in the diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma. We believe that our method provides an innovative and reliable means for making diagnostic suggestions and can be deployed at low cost as next-generation, artificial intelligence-enhanced CAD technology for use in diagnostic pathology.
   Diagnostic pathology currently requires substantial human expertise, often with high inter-observer variability. A whole-slide pathology method automates the prediction process and provides computer-aided diagnosis using artificial intelligence.

ID ADVANCE DIRECTIVES; MEDICAL-CARE; LIFE; ADULTS
AB Background:Surrogates, proxies, and clinicians making shared treatment decisions for patients who have lost decision-making capacity often fail to honor patients' wishes, due to stress, time pressures, misunderstanding patient values, and projecting personal biases. Advance directives intend to align care with patient values but are limited by low completion rates and application to only a subset of medical decisions. Here, we investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to incorporate patient values in supporting critical care clinical decision-making for incapacitated patients in a proof-of-concept study.Methods:We simulated text-based scenarios for 50 decisionally incapacitated patients for whom a medical condition required imminent clinical decisions regarding specific interventions. For each patient, we also simulated five unique value profiles captured using alternative formats: numeric ranking questionnaires, text-based questionnaires, and free-text narratives. We used pre-trained generative LLMs for two tasks: 1) text extraction of the treatments under consideration and 2) prompt-based question-answering to generate a recommendation in response to the scenario information, extracted treatment, and patient value profiles. Model outputs were compared with adjudications by three domain experts who independently evaluated each scenario and decision.Results and Conclusions:Automated extractions of the treatment in question were accurate for 88% (n = 44/50) of scenarios. LLM treatment recommendations received an average Likert score by the adjudicators of 3.92 of 5.00 (five being best) across all patients for being medically plausible and reasonable treatment recommendations, and 3.58 of 5.00 for reflecting the documented values of the patient. Scores were highest when patient values were captured as short, unstructured, and free-text narratives based on simulated patient profiles. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the potential for LLMs to function as support tools for surrogates, proxies, and clinicians aiming to honor the wishes and values of decisionally incapacitated patients.

AB Hydrological drought forecasting is essential for effective water resource management planning. Innovations in computer science and artificial intelligence (AI) have been incorporated into Earth science research domains to improve predictive performance for water resource planning and disaster management. Forecasting of future hydrological drought can assist with mitigation strategies for various stakeholders. This study uses the transformer deep learning model to forecast hydrological drought, with a benchmark comparison with the long short-term memory (LSTM) model. These models were applied to the Apalachicola River, Florida, with two gauging stations located at Chattahoochee and Blountstown. Daily stage-height data from the period 1928-2022 were collected from these two stations. The two deep learning models were used to predict stage data for five different time steps: 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 days. A drought series was created from the forecasted values using a monthly fixed threshold of the 75th percentile (75Q). The transformer model outperformed the LSTM model for all of the timescales at both locations when considering the following averages: MSE = 0.11, MAE = 0.21, RSME = 0.31, and R-2 = 0.92 for the Chattahoochee station, and MSE = 0.06, MAE = 0.19, RSME = 0.23, and R-2 = 0.93 for the Blountstown station. The transformer model exhibited greater accuracy in generating the same drought series as the observed data after applying the 75Q threshold, with few exceptions. Considering the evaluation criteria, the transformer deep learning model accurately forecasts hydrological drought in the Apalachicola River, which could be helpful for drought planning and mitigation in this area of contested water resources, and likely has broad applicability elsewhere.

AB With advances in areas such as sensors and machine learning, wearable technologies will have increased potential to support our daily lives. Even though today's landscape of smart wearable devices is highly varied, the real-world adoption of wearables has remained lukewarm. We propose that a key reason is that we currently only have a surface-level understanding of people's interaction behaviors with wearable devices. A deeper understanding of user behaviors toward different wearable devices will help to inform wearable design for more seamless user experiences. We present an empirical study with 50 participants that explore people's micro-behaviors toward five types of smart wearable devices (wristband, ring, clip, necklace, glasses) in a lab-based information-gathering context. A micro-analysis of participants' session videos and interviews showed that people have different behaviors and attitudes in terms of affordances and functionality for different forms of wearables giving rise to a variety of design implications.

AB In this paper we used two sets of calculated molecular descriptors to predict blood-brain barrier (BBB) entry of a collection of 415 chemicals. The set of 579 descriptors were calculated by Schrodinger and TopoCluj software. Polly and Triplet software were used to calculate the second set of 198 descriptors. Following this, modelling and a two-deep, repeated external validation method was used for QSAR formulation. Results show that both sets of descriptors individually and their combination give models of reasonable prediction accuracy. We also uncover the effectiveness of a variable selection approach, by showing that for one of our descriptor sets, the top 5 % predictors in terms of random forest variable importance are able to provide a better performing model than the model with all predictors. The top influential descriptors indicate important aspects of molecular structural features that govern BBB entry of chemicals.

AB A distinctive feature of game-based learning environments is their capacity for enabling stealth assessment. Stealth assessment analyzes a stream of fine-grained student interaction data from a game-based learning environment to dynamically draw inferences about students' competencies through evidence-centered design. In evidence-centered design, evidence models have been traditionally designed using statistical rules authored by domain experts that are encoded using Bayesian networks. This article presents DeepStealth, a deep learning-based stealth assessment framework, that yields significant reductions in the feature engineering labor that has previously been required to create stealth assessments. DeepStealth utilizes end-to-end trainable deep neural network-based evidence models. Using this framework, evidence models are devised using a set of predictive features captured from raw, low-level interaction data to infer evidence for competencies. We investigate two deep learning-based evidence models, long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and n-gram encoded feedforward neural networks (FFNNs). We compare these models' predictive performance for inferring students' knowledge to linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs) and naive Bayes models. We perform feature set-level analyses of game trace logs and external pre-learning measures, and we examine the models' early prediction capacity. The framework is evaluated using data collected from 182 middle school students interacting with a game-based learning environment for middle grade computational thinking. Results indicate that LSTM-based stealth assessors outperform competitive baseline approaches with respect to predictive accuracy and early prediction capacity. We find that LSTMs, FFNNs, and CRFs all benefit from combined feature sets derived from both game trace logs and external pre-learning measures.

AB Understanding the COVID-19 vaccine hesitation, such as who and why, is significant as the adoption of widespread vaccination remains the most effective approach to controlling pandemic outbreaks. Such an understanding can further aid in developing effective immunization programs for future pandemics. Unfortunately, there are numerous aspects to consider while determining whether to accept the vaccination, particularly from a cultural perspective. To achieve these objectives, we develop a novel culture-aware machine learning (ML) model for predicting vaccination willingness based on our new dataset. We next use advanced AI explainers such as the Probabilistic Graphical Model and Shapley Additive Explanations to analyze the most important and composite features contributing to the ML model's predictions. These investigations identify the key characteristics that are most likely to influence vaccination acceptance decisions. Our findings show that Hispanics and African Americans are most likely impacted by cultural characteristics such as religion and ethnic affiliation, whereas the vaccine trust and approval influence the Asian communities the most. Our results also show that cultural characteristics, rumors, and political affiliation are associated with increased vaccine rejection. Our findings show that Asians are most likely impacted by vaccine trust and approval, whereas the Hispanic and African American communities are most likely influenced by cultural characteristics such as religion and ethnic affiliation. The experiment's code can be found here: https://github.com/raed19/Deep-learning-Framework-with-Multi-perspective-Social-Behaviors-for-Vaccine-Hesitation

ID CONTROL CHARTS; MULTIVARIATE
AB Machine learning methods have been widely used in different applications, including process control and monitoring. For handling statistical process control (SPC) problems, conventional supervised machine learning methods (e.g., artificial neural networks and support vector machines) would have some difficulties. For instance, a training dataset containing both in-control and out-of-control (OC) process observations is required by a supervised machine learning method, but it is rarely available in SPC applications. Furthermore, many machine learning methods work like black boxes. It is often difficult to interpret their learning mechanisms and the resulting decision rules in the context of an application. In the SPC literature, there have been some existing discussions on how to handle the lack of OC observations in the training data, using the one-class classification, artificial contrast, real-time contrast, and some other novel ideas. However, these approaches have their own limitations to handle SPC problems. In this article, we extend the self-starting process monitoring idea that has been employed widely in modern SPC research to a general learning framework for monitoring processes with serially correlated data. Under the new framework, process characteristics to learn are well specified in advance, and process learning is sequential in the sense that the learned process characteristics keep being updated during process monitoring. The learned process characteristics are then incorporated into a control chart for detecting process distributional shift based on all available data by the current observation time. Numerical studies show that process monitoring based on the new learning framework is more reliable and effective than some representative existing machine learning SPC approaches.

DT Editorial Material

ID HEALTH; OVERDOSE; MODEL; RISK
AB Medication treatment for opioid use disorder (MOUD) is an effective evidence-based therapy for decreasing opioid-related adverse outcomes. Effective strategies for retaining persons on MOUD, an essential step to improving outcomes, are needed as roughly half of all persons initiating MOUD discontinue within a year. Data science may be valuable and promising for improving MOUD retention by using "big data" (e.g., electronic health record data, claims data mobile/sensor data, social media data) and specific machine learning techniques (e.g., predictive modeling, natural language processing, reinforcement learning) to individualize patient care. Maximizing the utility of data science to improve MOUD retention requires a three-pronged approach: (1) increasing funding for data science research for OUD, (2) integrating data from multiple sources including treatment for OUD and general medical care as well as data not specific to medical care (e.g., mobile, sensor, and social media data), and (3) applying multiple data science approaches with integrated big data to provide insights and optimize advances in the OUD and overall addiction fields.

AB We compare different neural network architectures for machine learning algorithms designed to identify the neutrino interaction vertex position in the MINERvA detector. The architectures developed and optimized by hand are compared with the architectures developed in an automated way using the package "Multi-node Evolutionary Neural Networks for Deep Lear ning" (MENNDL), developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. While the domain-expert hand-tuned network was the best performer, the differences were negligible and the auto-generated networks performed as well. There is always a trade-off between human, and computer resources for network optimization and this work suggests that automated optimization, assuming resources are available, provides a compelling way to save significant expert time.

AB In the past two decades, machine learning potentials (MLPs) have driven significant developments in chemical, biological, and material sciences. The construction and training of MLPs enable fast and accurate simulations and analysis of thermodynamic and kinetic properties. This review focuses on the application of MLPs to reaction systems with consideration of bond breaking and formation. We review the development of MLP models, primarily with neural network and kernel-based algorithms, and recent applications of reactive MLPs (RMLPs) to systems at different scales. We show how RMLPs are constructed, how they speed up the calculation of reactive dynamics, and how they facilitate the study of reaction trajectories, reaction rates, free energy calculations, and many other calculations. Different data sampling strategies applied in building RMLPs are also discussed with a focus on how to collect structures for rare events and how to further improve their performance with active learning.

AB Selective area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns can provide valuable insight into the structure of a material. However, the manual identification of collected patterns can be a significant bottleneck in the overall phase classification workflow. In this work, we utilize the recent advances in computer vision and machine learning (ML) to automate the indexing of SAED patterns. The performance of six different ML algorithms is demonstrated using metallic plutonium -zirconium alloys. The most successful approach trained a neural network (NN) to make a classification of the phase and zone axis, and then utilized a second NN to synthesize multiple independent predictions of different tilts in a single sample to make an overall phase identification. The results demonstrate that automated SAED phase identification using ML is a viable route to accelerate materials characterization. (c) 2024 The Authors.

   language processing; transformer model
AB Objective To solve major clinical natural language processing (NLP) tasks using a unified text-to-text learning architecture based on a generative large language model (LLM) via prompt tuning.Methods We formulated 7 key clinical NLP tasks as text-to-text learning and solved them using one unified generative clinical LLM, GatorTronGPT, developed using GPT-3 architecture and trained with up to 20 billion parameters. We adopted soft prompts (ie, trainable vectors) with frozen LLM, where the LLM parameters were not updated (ie, frozen) and only the vectors of soft prompts were updated, known as prompt tuning. We added additional soft prompts as a prefix to the input layer, which were optimized during the prompt tuning. We evaluated the proposed method using 7 clinical NLP tasks and compared them with previous task-specific solutions based on Transformer models.Results and Conclusion The proposed approach achieved state-of-the-art performance for 5 out of 7 major clinical NLP tasks using one unified generative LLM. Our approach outperformed previous task-specific transformer models by similar to 3% for concept extraction and 7% for relation extraction applied to social determinants of health, 3.4% for clinical concept normalization, 3.4%-10% for clinical abbreviation disambiguation, and 5.5%-9% for natural language inference. Our approach also outperformed a previously developed prompt-based machine reading comprehension (MRC) model, GatorTron-MRC, for clinical concept and relation extraction. The proposed approach can deliver the "one model for all" promise from training to deployment using a unified generative LLM.

AB ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of machine learning regression models in predicting the final color of leucite-reinforced glass CAD/CAM ceramic veneer restorations based on substrate shade, ceramic shade, thickness and translucency. MethodsLeucite-reinforced glass ceramics in four different shades were sectioned in thicknesses of 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 1.2 mm. The CIELab coordinates of each specimen were obtained over four different backgrounds (black, white, A1, and A3) interposed with an experimental translucent resin cement using a calibrated spectrophotometer. The color change (CIEDE2000) values, as well as all the CIELab values for each one of the experimental groups, were submitted to 28 different regression models. Each regression model was adjusted according to the weights of each dependent variable to achieve the best-fitting model. ResultsDifferent substrates, ceramic shades, and thicknesses influenced the L, a, and b of the final restoration. Of all variables, the substrate influenced the final ceramic shade most, followed by the ceramic thickness and the L, a, and b of the ceramic. The decision tree regression model had the lowest mean absolute error and highest accuracy to predict the shade of the ceramic restoration according to the substrate shade, ceramic shade and thickness. Clinical SignificanceThe machine learning regression model developed in the study can help clinicians predict the final color of the ceramic veneers made with leucite-reinforced glass CAD/CAM ceramic HT and LT when cemented with translucent cements, based on the color of the substrate and ceramic thicknesses.

AB While machine learning (ML) has shown great promise in medical diagnostics, a major challenge is that ML models do not always perform equally well among ethnic groups. This is alarming for women's health, as there are already existing health disparities that vary by ethnicity. Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal syndrome among women of reproductive age and has clear diagnostic differences among ethnic groups. Here, we investigate the ability of four ML algorithms to diagnose BV. We determine the fairness in the prediction of asymptomatic BV using 16S rRNA sequencing data from Asian, Black, Hispanic, and white women. General purpose ML model performances vary based on ethnicity. When evaluating the metric of false positive or false negative rate, we find that models perform least effectively for Hispanic and Asian women. Models generally have the highest performance for white women and the lowest for Asian women. These findings demonstrate a need for improved methodologies to increase model fairness for predicting BV.

AB This paper introduces a spatially explicit random forests-based hedonic price modeling approach to account for spatial autocorrelation in the data. Spatial autocorrelation is a common data structure in georeferenced data, and controlling associations among spatial objects is crucial for accurate statistical analysis. Validations of machine learning and artificial intelligence applications require using out-of-sample data sets to assess models' fit on the training dataset. Previous research has shown that nonspatial cross-validation methods, commonly used in machine learning applications for spatial data, often provide over-optimistic results. Some recommended the use of spatial cross-validation methods to obtain more reliable estimates. However, the machine learning models used in these previous studies did not include spatially explicit parameters to account for spatial autocorrelation in the data. Unlike machine learning-based models, statistical-based models such as the spatial lag model can effectively account for spatial autocorrelation in the data. This research applied a two-stage least squares random forests framework to construct a hedonic pricing model incorporating a spatial lag for the Miami-Dade single-family residential parcel sales data. Random forests models are evaluated using K-fold, spatial blocking K-fold, and spatial leave-one-out cross-validation methods. The goodness-of-fit of the tested random forests-based models is evaluated using the coefficient of determination and mean square error scores. Additionally, spatial autocorrelations in residuals from random forests models are investigated by conducting Moran's I test. Our research indicates that failing to account for spatial autocorrelation in data can lead to unreliable and overly optimistic estimates. However, including a spatially lagged variable substantially reduces fluctuations in goodness-of-fit measures across different validation sets.

AB Electromyography (EMG) is an integral part of many biomedical and healthcare applications. It has been used as a metric for tracking rehabilitation progress and identifying diseases that affect muscle activation patterns. Although it is widely used in many disciplines, conventional EMG recording and interpretation techniques lack in providing precise signal detection and robust classification accuracy. In recent years, thanks to advances in both material science and artificial intelligence, EMG detection techniques are improving at a rapid pace. Materials that allow for enhanced biocompatibility have improved the quality of data recorded by electrodes. The use of machine learning algorithms has paved new ways to understand complex EMG signals, triggering diverse, novel, and improved application scenarios within the healthcare framework. To help readers establish a clear picture of the two most important components in EMG technology, i.e., electrodes and algorithms, while catching up with the latest research outcomes, this review article is composed. The article starts by introducing conventional EMG electrode materials and architectures, then explains how state-of-the-art works have improved electrode utilization. Subsequently, EMG signal conditioning and interpretation algorithms are investigated. Finally, current challenges in the research domain and authors' perspectives are discussed.

AB Dynamic virtual machine (VM) consolidation is a constructive technique to enhance resource usage and is extensively employed to minimize data centers' energy consumption. However, in the current approaches, consolidation techniques are heavily relied on reducing the actively used physical servers (PMs) based on their current resource utilization without considering future resource demands. Also, many of the reported works for cloud workload prediction applied univariate time series-based forecasting models and neglected the dependency of other resource utilization metrics. Thus, resulting in inaccurate predictions, unnecessary migrations, high migration costs, and increased service level agreement violations (SLAVs) may nullify the consolidation benefits. To efficiently address this issue, we propose a multivariate resource usage prediction-based hotspots and coldspots mitigation approach that considers both the current and future usage of resources with O(sk) time complexity, where s and k denote the number of PMs and VMs, respectively. The proposed technique uses a clustering-based stacked bidirectional (Long Short-Term Memory) LSTM deep learning network to predict the future memory and CPU usage of PMs and VMs with high accuracy and O((Q(Q+W)*Theta) computational complexity, where Q, W, and Theta represent the number of hidden layer cells, outputs, and training epochs, respectively. Through extensive simulations based on Google's cluster workload traces, we demonstrate that our proposed method obtains substantial improvements in terms of prediction performance, energy-efficiency, actively used PMs, VM migrations, and SLA violations over the benchmark approaches.

TI Finding Universal Relations in Subhalo Properties with Artificial

SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL

DT Article
ID SIMULATING GALAXY FORMATION; ILLUSTRISTNG SIMULATIONS
AB We use a generic formalism designed to search for relations in high-dimensional spaces to determine if the total mass of a subhalo can be predicted from other internal properties such as velocity dispersion, radius, or star formation rate. We train neural networks using data from the Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations project and show that the model can predict the total mass of a subhalo with high accuracy: more than 99% of the subhalos have a predicted mass within 0.2 dex of their true value. The networks exhibit surprising extrapolation properties, being able to accurately predict the total mass of any type of subhalo containing any kind of galaxy at any redshift from simulations with different cosmologies, astrophysics models, subgrid physics, volumes, and resolutions, indicating that the network may have found a universal relation. We then use different methods to find equations that approximate the relation found by the networks and derive new analytic expressions that predict the total mass of a subhalo from its radius, velocity dispersion, and maximum circular velocity. We show that in some regimes, the analytic expressions are more accurate than the neural networks. The relation found by the neural network and approximated by the analytic equation bear similarities to the virial theorem.

AB Individuals who have suffered neurotrauma like a stroke or brachial plexus injury often experience reduced limb functionality. Soft robotic exoskeletons have been successful in assisting rehabilitative treatment and improving activities of daily life but restoring dexterity for tasks such as playing musical instruments has proven challenging. This research presents a soft robotic hand exoskeleton coupled with machine learning algorithms to aid in relearning how to play the piano by `feeling' the difference between correct and incorrect versions of the same song. The exoskeleton features piezoresistive sensor arrays with 16 taxels integrated into each fingertip. The hand exoskeleton was created as a single unit, with polyvinyl acid (PVA) used as a stent and later dissolved to construct the internal pressure chambers for the five individually actuated digits. Ten variations of a song were produced, one that was correct and nine containing rhythmic errors. To classify these song variations, Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithms were trained with data from the 80 taxels combined from the tactile sensors in the fingertips. Feeling the differences between correct and incorrect versions of the song was done with the exoskeleton independently and while the exoskeleton was worn by a person. Results demonstrated that the ANN algorithm had the highest classification accuracy of 97.13% +/- 2.00% with the human subject and 94.60% +/- 1.26% without. These findings highlight the potential of the smart exoskeleton to aid disabled individuals in relearning dexterous tasks like playing musical instruments.

AB We present a methodology based on the implementation of a fully connected neural network algorithm to estimate the temporal evolution of the high-frequency gravitational wave emission for a core collapse supernova (CCSN). For this study, we selected a fully connected deep neural network (DNN) regression model because it can learn both linear and nonlinear relationships between the input and output data, it is more appropriate for handling large-dimensional input data, and it offers high performance at a low computational cost. To train the Machine Learning (ML) algorithm, we construct a training dataset using synthetic waveforms, and several CCSN waveforms are used to test the algorithm. We performed a first-order estimation of the high-frequency gravitational wave emission on real interferometric LIGO data from the second half of the third observing run (O3b) with a two detector network (L1 and H1). The relative error associated with the estimate of the slope of the resonant frequency versus time for the GW from CCSN signals is within 13% for the tested candidates included in this study up to different Galactic distances (1.0, 2.3, 3.1, 4.3, 5.4, 7.3, and 10 kpc). This method is, to date, the best estimate of the temporal evolution of the high-frequency emission in real interferometric data. Our methodology of estimation can be used in future studies focused on physical properties of the progenitor. The distances where comparable performances could be achieved for Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer roughly rescale with the noise floor improvements.

AB The deep-learning-based least squares method has shown successful results in solving high-dimensional and non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs). However, this method usually converges slowly. To speed up the convergence of this approach, an active-learning-based sampling algorithm is proposed in this paper. This algorithm actively chooses the most informative training samples from a probability density function based on residual errors to facilitate error reduction. In particular, points with larger residual errors will have more chances of being selected for training. This algorithm imitates the human learning process: learners are likely to spend more time repeatedly studying mistakes than other tasks they have correctly finished. A series of numerical results are illustrated to demonstrate the effectiveness of our active-learning-based sampling in high dimensions to speed up the convergence of the deep-learning-based least squares method.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB Firms are required to provide financial information via the financial statements and the management discussion and analysis (MD&A), a narrative explanation of the financial statements. Our study examines how firms use the MD&A channel when their financial statement channel is inadequate. We focus on two textual attributes of the MD&A: non-GAAP disclosure and forward-looking statements. We find that firms with less adequate financial statements discuss non-GAAP measures more and provide a larger number of forward-looking statements. We then identify the topics, and therefore the context, in which non-GAAP and forward-looking disclosures are provided. Our study provides evidence on how managers use the MD&A, a relatively more flexible channel, to provide information when their financial statement channel is less adequate.

ID CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK; DISTANCE-DRIVEN PROJECTION; REDUCTION
AB We propose an Efficient Inexact Learned Descent-type Algorithm (ELDA) for a class of nonconvex and nonsmooth variational models, where the regularization consists of a sparsity enhancing term and non-local smoothing term for learned features. The ELDA improves the performance of the LDA in Chen et al. (SIAM J Imag Sci 14(4), 1532-1564, 2021) by reducing the number of the subproblems from two to one for most of the iterations and allowing inexact gradient computation. We generate a deep neural network, whose architecture follows the algorithm exactly for low-dose CT (LDCT) reconstruction. The network inherits the convergence behavior of the algorithm and is interpretable as a solution of the varational model and parameter efficient. The experimental results from the ablation study and comparisons with several state-of-the-art deep learning approaches indicate the promising performance of the proposed method in solution accuracy and parameter efficiency.

DE scheduling; flow-shop; heuristics; adaptive learning; neural networks
ID GENETIC ALGORITHMS; SEARCH ALGORITHM; SHOP
AB We propose an improvement-heuristic approach for the general flow-shop problem (n/m/C-max) based on the idea of adaptive learning. The approach employs a one-pass heuristic to give a good starting solution in the search space and uses a weight parameter to perturb the data of the original problem to obtain improved solutions. The weights are then adjusted employing a learning strategy which involves reinforcement and backtracking. The learning is similar to that in neural networks. The random perturbation allows a non-deterministic local search. We apply the improvement-heuristic approach in conjunction with three well-known heuristics in the literature, namely, Palmer's Slope Index, CDS and NEH. We test our approach on several benchmark problem sets including Taillard's, Carlier's, Heller's and Reeves'. We compare our results to the best-known upper-bound solutions and find that for many problems we match the best-known upper bound. For one problem we discover a new upper bound.

AB Robot-based assembly in construction has emerged as a promising solution to address numerous challenges such as increasing costs, labor shortages, and the demand for safe and efficient construction processes. One of the main obstacles in realizing the full potential of these robotic systems is the need for effective and efficient sequence planning for construction tasks. Current approaches, including mathematical and heuristic techniques or machine learning methods, face limitations in their adaptability and scalability to dynamic construction environments. To expand the current robot system's sequential understanding ability, this paper introduces RoboGPT, a novel system that leverages the advanced reasoning capabilities of ChatGPT, a large language model, for automated sequence planning in robot-based assembly applied to construction tasks. The proposed system adapts ChatGPT for construction sequence planning and demonstrates its feasibility and effectiveness through experimental evaluation including two case studies and 80 trials involving real construction tasks. The results show that RoboGPT-driven robots can handle complex construction operations and adapt to changes on the fly. This paper contributes to the ongoing efforts to enhance the capabilities and performance of robot-based assembly systems in the construction industry, and it paves the way for further integration of large language model technologies in the field of construction robotics.

TI Multi-modal deep learning improves grain yield prediction in wheat
   breeding by fusing genomics and phenomics
SO BIOINFORMATICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Motivation: Developing new crop varieties with superior performance is highly important to ensure robust and sustainable global food security. The speed of variety development is limited by long field cycles and advanced generation selections in plant breeding programs. While methods to predict yield from genotype or phenotype data have been proposed, improved performance and integrated models are needed. Results: We propose a machine learning model that leverages both genotype and phenotype measurements by fusing genetic variants with multiple data sources collected by unmanned aerial systems. We use a deep multiple instance learning framework with an attention mechanism that sheds light on the importance given to each input during prediction, enhancing interpretability. Our model reaches 0.75460.024 Pearson correlation coefficient when predicting yield in similar environmental conditions; a 34.8% improvement over the genotype-only linear baseline (0.55960.050). We further predict yield on new lines in an unseen environment using only genotypes, obtaining a prediction accuracy of 0.38660.010, a 13.5% improvement over the linear baseline. Our multi-modal deep learning architecture efficiently accounts for plant health and environment, distilling the genetic contribution and providing excellent predictions. Yield prediction algorithms leveraging phenotypic observations during training therefore promise to improve breeding programs, ultimately speeding up delivery of improved varieties.

ID ASSOCIATION
AB The recent development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, especially the advance of deep neural network (DNN) technology, has revolutionized many fields. While DNN plays a central role in modern AI technology, it has rarely been used in genetic data analysis due to analytical and computational challenges brought by high-dimensional genetic data and an increasing number of samples. To facilitate the use of AI in genetic data analysis, we developed a C ++ package, AIGen, based on two newly developed neural networks (i.e. kernel neural networks and functional neural networks) that are capable of modeling complex genotype-phenotype relationships (e.g. interactions) while providing robust performance against high-dimensional genetic data. Moreover, computationally efficient algorithms (e.g. a minimum norm quadratic unbiased estimation approach and batch training) are implemented in the package to accelerate the computation, making them computationally efficient for analyzing large-scale datasets with thousands or even millions of samples. By applying AIGen to the UK Biobank dataset, we demonstrate that it can efficiently analyze large-scale genetic data, attain improved accuracy, and maintain robust performance. Availability: AIGen is developed in C ++ and its source code, along with reference libraries, is publicly accessible on GitHub at https://github.com/TingtHou/AIGen.

AB The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of artificial intelligence tools for the prediction of Salmonella presence and absence in agricultural surface waters based on the population of microbiological indicators (total coliform, generic Escherichia coli, and enterococci) and physicochemical attributes of water (air and water temperature, conductivity, ORP, pH, and turbidity). Previously collected data set from six agricultural ponds monitored for two growing seasons were used for analysis. Classification algorithms including artificial neural networks (ANNs), the nearest neighborhood algorithm (kNN), and support vector machines (SVM) were trained and tested with a 539-point data set for optimum prediction accuracy. Classification accuracy performances were validated with data set (400 samples) collected from different agricultural surface water sources. All tested algorithms yielded the highest accuracy around 75 +/- 1% for generic E. coli followed by enterococci (65 +/- 5%) and total coliform (60 +/- 10%). Classifiers calculated 6-15% higher accuracy ranging from 62 to 66% for turbidity than all other tested physicochemical attributes. Based on E. coli populations measured in other water sources, trained algorithms predicted the presence and absence of Salmonella with an accuracy between 58.15 and 59.23%. The classification performance of ANN, kNN, and SVM algorithms are encouraging for the prediction of Salmonella in agricultural surface waters.

AB Background The algorithmic patient preference predictor (PPP) has been proposed to aid in decision making for incapacitated patients in the absence of advanced directives. Ethical and legal challenges aside, multiple practical barriers exist for building a personalized PPP. Here, we examine previous work using machine learning to predict patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) for capacitated patients undergoing diverse procedures, therapies, and life events. Demonstrating robust performance in predicting PROMs for capacitated patients could suggest opportunities for developing a model tailored to incapacitated ones.Methods We performed a scoping review of PubMed, Embase, and Scopus using the PRISMA-ScR guidelines to capture studies using machine learning to predict PROMs following a medical event alongside qualitative studies exploring a theoretical PPP.Results Sixty-eight studies used machine learning to evaluate PROMs; an additional 20 studies focused on a theoretical PPP. For PROMs, orthopedic surgeries (n = 33) and spinal surgeries (n = 12) were the most common medical event. Studies used demographic (n = 30), pre-event PROMs (n = 52), comorbidities (n = 29), social determinants of health (n = 30), and intraoperative variables (n = 124) as predictors. Thirty-four different PROMs were used as the target outcome. Evaluation metrics varied by task, but performance was overall poor to moderate for the best reported scores. In models that used feature importance, pre-event PROMs were the most predictive of post-event PROMs. Fairness assessments were rare (n = 6). These findings reinforce the necessity of the integrating patient values and preferences, beyond demographic factors, to improve the development of personalized PPP models for incapacitated patients.Conclusion The primary objective of a PPP is to estimate patient-reported quality of life following an intervention. Use of machine learning to predict PROMs for capacitated patients introduces challenges and opportunities for building a personalized PPP for incapacitated patients without advanced directives.

AB Deep learning method for solving elliptic hemivariational inequalities is constructed. Using a variational formulation of the corresponding inequality, we reduce it to an unconstrained expectation minimization problem and solve the last one by a stochastic optimization algorithm. The method is applied to a frictional bilateral contact problem and to a frictionless normal compliance contact problem. Numerical experiments show that for fine meshes, the method approximates the solution with accuracy similar to the virtual element method. Besides, the use of local adaptive activation functions improves accuracy and has almost the same computational cost.

AB Hydrology relates to many complex challenges due to climate variability, limited resources, and especially, increased demands on sustainable management of water and soil. Conventional approaches often cannot respond to the integrated complexity and continuous change inherent in the water system; hence, researchers have explored advanced data-driven solutions. This review paper revisits how artificial intelligence (AI) is dramatically changing the most important facets of hydrological research, including soil and land surface modeling, streamflow, groundwater forecasting, water quality assessment, and remote sensing applications in water resources. In soil and land modeling, AI techniques could further enhance accuracy in soil texture analysis, moisture estimation, and erosion prediction for better land management. Advanced AI models could also be used as a tool to forecast streamflow and groundwater levels, therefore providing valuable lead times for flood preparedness and water resource planning in transboundary basins. In water quality, AI-driven methods improve contamination risk assessment, enable the detection of anomalies, and track pollutants to assist in water treatment processes and regulatory practices. AI techniques combined with remote sensing open new perspectives on monitoring water resources at a spatial scale, from flood forecasting to groundwater storage variations. This paper's synthesis emphasizes AI's immense potential in hydrology; it also covers the latest advances and future prospects of the field to ensure sustainable water and soil management.

AB Yield prediction of citrus provides critical information before harvest to growers and allied industry to predict the resources required for workers, storage, and transportation of the harvest. In this study, three machine learning (ML) based models were developed for tree-level citrus yield prediction: (i) Model-1 utilized UAV imagery; (ii) Model-2 utilized UAV imagery and ground-based fruit detection and counts from images taken from one side of the tree; and (iii) Model-3 utilized UAV imagery and ground-based fruit detection and counts from images taken from two sides of the tree. The UAV images were used as input to a novel cloud-based technology, Agroview, to get the tree health, height, and canopy area information. The multispectral bands and the tree structural parameters were the input for Model-1. Two images per tree were captured from the ground using an RGB camera (one from each side) and were used for fruit count using an object detection algorithm, YOLOv3. Harvest data was collected manually per tree (fruit count and weight). Four ML algorithms - gradient boosting regression (GBR), random forest regression (RFR), linear regression (LR), and partial least squares regression (PLSR) were used to generate the models. Model-2 (MAPE of 23.45%) performed similarly to Model-3 (MAPE of 25.72%) and significantly better than Model-1 (MAPE of 35.59%). Model-2 was selected as the best model because of its low MAPE value in predicting yield at the tree level, and data collection simplicity (compared to Model-3).

AB Diseases of the lung account for more than 5 million deaths worldwide and are a healthcare burden. Improving clinical outcomes, including mortality and quality of life, involves a holistic understanding of the disease, which can be provided by the integration of lung multi-omics data. An enhanced understanding of comprehensive multiomic datasets provides opportunities to leverage those datasets to inform the treatment and prevention of lung diseases by classifying severity, prognostication, and discovery of biomarkers. The main objective of this review is to summarize the use of multiomics investigations in lung disease, including multiomics integration and the use of machine learning computational methods. This review also discusses lung disease models, including animal models, organoids, and single-cell lines, to study multiomics in lung health and disease. We provide examples of lung diseases where multi-omics investigations have provided deeper insight into etiopathogenesis and have resulted in improved preventative and therapeutic interventions.

AB Remote sensing can transform the speed, scale, and cost of biodiversity and forestry surveys. Data acquisition currently outpaces the ability to identify individual organisms in high resolution imagery. We outline an approach for identifying tree-crowns in RGB imagery while using a semi-supervised deep learning detection network. Individual crown delineation has been a long-standing challenge in remote sensing and available algorithms produce mixed results. We show that deep learning models can leverage existing Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR)-based unsupervised delineation to generate trees that are used for training an initial RGB crown detection model. Despite limitations in the original unsupervised detection approach, this noisy training data may contain information from which the neural network can learn initial tree features. We then refine the initial model using a small number of higher-quality hand-annotated RGB images. We validate our proposed approach while using an open-canopy site in the National Ecological Observation Network. Our results show that a model using 434,551 self-generated trees with the addition of 2848 hand-annotated trees yields accurate predictions in natural landscapes. Using an intersection-over-union threshold of 0.5, the full model had an average tree crown recall of 0.69, with a precision of 0.61 for the visually-annotated data. The model had an average tree detection rate of 0.82 for the field collected stems. The addition of a small number of hand-annotated trees improved the performance over the initial self-supervised model. This semi-supervised deep learning approach demonstrates that remote sensing can overcome a lack of labeled training data by generating noisy data for initial training using unsupervised methods and retraining the resulting models with high quality labeled data.

AB The steady growth of online materials databases, coupled with efforts in materials informatics, has invited the reexamination of existing empirical models through the lens of modern machine learning techniques. Inspired by recent efforts to improve on the Goldschmidt tolerance factor for perovskite formation, we apply the symbolic regression to the problem of predicting octahedral tilting. In addition to its impact on the crystal structure, octahedral tilting is related to functional properties, including dielectric permittivity, ferroelectricity, magnetic properties, and metal-insulator transitions. By relating a selection of physical parameters (e.g., atomic radii, electronegativity) with mathematical operations (e.g., addition, exponentiation), we identify an analytical equation that correctly predicts the octahedral tilting classification for 49 perovskite oxides in a dataset of 60 materials. Using the same training dataset, we additionally fit and compare seven models generated by other common machine learning methods. Despite the increased complexity afforded by support vector machines, decision trees/random forests, and artificial neural networks, we find that our equation outperforms the other models as well as the original tolerance factor in predicting octahedral tilting.

AB In developed countries, buildings are involved in almost 50% of total energy use and 30% of global green-house gas emissions. Buildings' operational energy is highly dependent on various building physical, operational, and functional characteristics, as well as meteorological and temporal properties. Besides physics-based building energy modeling, machine learning techniques can provide faster and higher accuracy estimates, given buildings' historic energy consumption data. Looking beyond individual building levels, forecasting buildings' energy performance helps city and community managers have a better understanding of their future energy needs, and plan for satisfying them more efficiently. Focusing on an urban-scale, this study systematically reviews 70 journal articles, published in the field of building energy performance forecasting between 2015 and 2018. The recent literature have been categorized according to five criteria: 1. Learning Method, 2. Building Type, 3. Energy Type, 4. Input Data, and 5. Time-scale. The scarcity of building energy performance forecasting studies in urban-scale versus individual level is considerable. There is no study incorporating building functionality in terms of space functionality share percentages, nor assessing the effects of climate change on urban buildings energy performance using machine learning approaches and future weather scenarios. There is no optimal criteria combination for achieving the most accurate machine learning-based forecast, as there is no universal measure able to provide such global comparison. Accuracy levels are highly correlated with the characteristics of forecasting problems. The goal is to provide a comprehensive status of machine learning applications in urban building energy performance forecasting, during 2015-2018.

AB In this manuscript, we analyze a data set containing information on children with Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) enrolled on a clinical trial. Treatments received and survival status were collected together with other covariates such as demographics and clinical measurements. Our main task is to explore the potential of machine learning (ML) algorithms in a survival analysis context in order to improve over the Cox Proportional Hazard (CoxPH) model. We discuss the weaknesses of the CoxPH model we would like to improve upon and then we introduce multiple algorithms, from well-established ones to state-of-the-art models, that solve these issues. We then compare every model according to the concordance index and the Brier score. Finally, we produce a series of recommendations, based on our experience, for practitioners that would like to benefit from the recent advances in artificial intelligence.

AB The objective of this paper is to inform the information systems (IS) manager and business analyst about the role of machine learning techniques in business data mining. Data mining is a fast growing application area in business. Machine learning techniques are used for data analysis and pattern discovery and thus can play a key role in the development of data mining applications. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques in the context of business is useful in selecting an appropriate method for a specific application. The paper, therefore, provides an overview of machine learning techniques and discusses their strengths and weaknesses in the context of mining business data, A survey of data mining applications in business is provided to investigate the use of learning techniques. Rule induction (RI) was found to be most popular, followed by neural networks (NNs) and case-based reasoning (CBR). Most applications were found in financial areas, where prediction of the future was a dominant task category. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Precise determination and assessment of bladder cancer (BC) extent of muscle invasion involvement guides proper risk stratification and personalized therapy selection. In this context, segmentation of both bladder walls and cancer are of pivotal importance, as it provides invaluable information to stage the primary tumor. Hence, multiregion segmentation on patients presenting with symptoms of bladder tumors using deep learning heralds a new level of staging accuracy and prediction of the biologic behavior of the tumor. Nevertheless, despite the success of these models in other medical problems, progress in multiregion bladder segmentation, particularly in MRI and CT modalities, is still at a nascent stage, with just a handful of works tackling a multiregion scenario. Furthermore, most existing approaches systematically follow prior literature in other clinical problems, without casting a doubt on the validity of these methods on bladder segmentation, which may present different challenges. Inspired by this, we provide an in-depth look at bladder cancer segmentation using deep learning models. The critical determinants for accurate differentiation of muscle invasive disease, current status of deep learning based bladder segmentation, lessons and limitations of prior work are highlighted.

AB Spatially-explicit data on the species composition of forest plants can be an important tool for forest management and conservation. One specific application of these data is for identifying tropical tree species through machine learning techniques to classify satellite remote sensing images. This study aims to examine the ability to use Worldview-2 high-resolution data with various machine learning methods to identify tree species in the Bogor Botanic Garden. Eighteen species from 11 families were selected as samples representing an ecologically and taxonomically diverse data set. Using aggregated image variables, each tree species was found to have different reflectance, texture, and spectral vegetation index variable values. Cluster analysis showed that the 18 tree species could be separated into three clusters that partly reflected taxonomic relationships. Four machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and Bayesian) were used to predict the species identity of pixels in the image data. A multicollinearity test using a Variance Inflation Factor method reduced the predictor variables from 54 to 9. The highest accuracy (0.96) was observed using SVM, followed by RF (0.91), KNN (0.86), and Bayesian (0.74). The implementation of high-resolution satellite imagery and machine learning for species identification in tropical ex situ plant conservation areas, such as botanic gardens is reported here for the first time.

AB The first objective of this study was to develop a model for the peak concrete temperature (T) based on predictors known as its primary influencers and verified by an artificial neural network (ANN). The second objective was to gauge the influence of the level of replacement of Portland cement (PC) with fly ash class F (FA) and slag cement (Slag) and the variation in the cementitious materials content in concrete (Wc) in typical mass concrete mixtures on T. The least dimension (LD), the concrete temperature at placement (CT), Wc, Slag and FA contents, in addition to tricalcium silicate (C3S) and tricalcium aluminate (C3A) in PC and the Fineness (F) of PC, were investigated. The temperatures of 111 massive elements with FA were simulated 43,768 times with the Levenberg-Marquardt (LMA) and Bayesian (Bayes) models in the ANN. The temperatures of 72 massive elements with Slag were simulated 78,255 times. The T of massive elements appeared better characterized by multivariate regressions. The variables that significantly affected the T seemed to be the LD, CT, and C3S content in PC-FA systems and the LD, CT, and Slag in PC-Slag systems. The LD appeared to exercise the most significant influence on T in both cementitious systems. High substitution levels of PC with FA and Slag should generate different effects. Slag appears to be more significant to T in this scenario. The accuracy of multivariate models trained by ANN algorithms and the low significance of Wc to control temperatures of a particular concrete class were revealing.

A total of 1,477 questions and 5,346 answers were analyzed, and the datasets were divided into two time periods: before and during the COVID-I9 pandemic. We conducted machine-learning-based topic modeling and deep-learning-based word embedding (VVord2Vec). Before the pandemic, the topics of physical difference and racism were prevalent, whereas, after the pandemic, the topics of hate crime, the need to stop Asian hate crimes, and the need for the Asian solidarity movement emerged. Above all, the semantic similarity between Asian and Black people became closer, while the similarity between Asian people and other racial/ethnic groups was diminished. The emergence of negative and radical language, which increased saliently after the outbreak of the pandemic, and the considerably wider semantic distance between Asian and White people indicates that the relationship between the two races has been weakened. The findings suggest a long-term campaign or education system to reduce racial tensions during the pandemic.

AB In this article, we investigate the nanoscale soil-water retention mechanism of unsaturated clay through molecular dynamics and machine learning. Pyrophyllite was chosen due to its stable structure and as the precursor of other 2:1 clay minerals. A series of molecular dynamics simulations of clay at low degrees of saturation were conducted. Soil water was represented by a point cloud through the center-of-mass method. Water-air interface area was measured numerically by the alpha-shape method. The soil-water retention mechanism at the nanoscale was analyzed by distinguishing adsorptive pressure and capillary pressure at different mass water contents and considering the apparent capillary interface area (i.e., water-air interface area per unit water volume). The water number density profile was used to quantify the adsorption effect. A neural-network based machine learning technique was utilized to construct functional relationships among matric suction, the mass water content, and the apparent water-air interface area. Our numerical results have demonstrated from a nanoscale perspective that the adsorption effect is dominated by the van der Waals force and hydroxyl hydration between the clay surface and water. As the mass water content increases, the adsorption pressure decreases, and capillarity plays a prominent role in the soil-water retention mechanism at the nanoscale.

AB Introduction: With global adoption of computed tomography (CT) lung cancer screening, there is increasing interest to use artificial intelligence (AI) deep learning methods to improve the clinical management process. To enable AI research using an open -source, cloud -based, globally distributed, screening CT imaging data set and computational environment that are compliant with the most stringent international privacy regulations that also protect the intellectual properties of researchers, the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer sponsored development of the Early Lung Imaging Confederation (ELIC) resource in 2018. The objective of this report is to describe the updated capabilities of ELIC and illustrate how this resource can be used for clinically relevant AI research. Methods: In this second phase of the initiative, metadata and screening CT scans from two time points were collected from 100 screening participants in seven countries. An automated deep learning AI lung segmentation algorithm, automated quantitative emphysema metrics, and a quantitative lung nodule volume measurement algorithm were run on these scans. Results: A total of 1394 CTs were collected from 697 participants. The LAV950 quantitative emphysema metric was found to be potentially useful in distinguishing lung cancer from benign cases using a combined slice thickness more than or equal to 2.5 mm. Lung nodule volume change measurements had better sensitivity and specificity for classifying malignant from benign lung nodules when applied to solid lung nodules from high -quality CT scans. Conclusions: These initial experiments revealed that ELIC can support deep learning AI and quantitative imaging analyses on diverse and globally distributed cloud -based data sets.

   BINARIES; CHOICE; LIGO
AB Gravitational wave science is a pioneering field with rapidly evolving data analysis methodology currently assimilating and inventing deep learning techniques. The bulk of the sophisticated flagship searches of the field rely on the time-tested matched filtering principle within their core. In this paper, we make a key observation on the relationship between the emerging deep learning and the traditional techniques: matched filtering is formally equivalent to a particular neural network. This means that a neural network can be constructed analytically to exactly implement matched filtering and can be further trained on data or boosted with additional complexity for improved performance. Moreover, we show that the proposed neural network architecture can outperform matched filtering, both with or without knowledge of a prior on the parameter distribution. When a prior is given, the proposed neural network can approach the statistically optimal performance. We also propose and investigate two different neural network architectures MNet-Shallow and MNet-Deep , both of which implement matched filtering at initialization and can be trained on data. MNet-Shallow has a simpler structure, while MNet-Deep is more flexible and can deal with a wider range of distributions. Our theoretical findings are corroborated by experiments using real LIGO data and synthetic injections, where our proposed methods significantly outperform matched filtering at false positive rates above 5 x 10(-3)%. The fundamental equivalence between matched filtering and neural networks allows us to define a "complexity standard candle" to characterize the relative complexity of the different approaches to gravitational wave signal searches in a common framework. Additionally, it also provides a glimpse of an intriguing symmetry that could provide clues on interpretability, namely how neural networks approach the problem of finding signals in overwhelming noise. Finally, our results suggest new perspectives on the role of deep learning in gravitational wave detection.

AB MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are similar to 22 nucleotide ubiquitous gene regulators. They modulate a broad range of essential cellular processes linked to human health and diseases. Consequently, identifying miRNA targets and understanding how they function are critical for treating miRNA associated diseases. In our earlier work, a hybrid deep learning-based approach (miTAR) was developed for predicting miRNA targets. It performs substantially better than the existing methods. The approach integrates two major types of deep learning algorithms: convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, the features in miRNA:target interactions learned by miTAR have not been investigated. In the current study, we demonstrated that miTAR captures known features, including the involvement of seed region and the free energy, as well as multiple novel features, in the miRNA:target interactions. Interestingly, the CNN and RNN layers of the model perform differently at capturing the free energy feature: the units in RNN layer is more unique at capturing the feature but collectively the CNN layer is more efficient at capturing the feature. Although deep learning models are commonly thought "black-boxes", our discoveries support that the biological features in miRNA:target can be unveiled from deep learning models, which will be beneficial to the understanding of the mechanisms in miRNA:target interactions.

AB This paper addresses the medical kit allocation problem by employing a unified robust stochastic programming (URSP) approach to enhance medical supply chain (MSC) viability during pandemics. A two-stage methodology is developed to account for the inherent uncertainty of demand. It begins with a machine learning (ML) algorithm for contagion level prediction, which adjusts demand forecasts accordingly. Subsequently, the URSP approach incorporates risk aversion and various types of uncertainty by combining stochastic programming and robust optimization through an adjustable weight in the objective function. As a risk-aversion technique, conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) is employed to restrict shortage levels, providing a more realistic assessment of MSC resilience. To balance cost-effectiveness and robustness against a spectrum of uncertainties, the URSP method leverages the strengths of both stochastic programming and robust optimization. Taguchi's orthogonal array design is utilized to generate cases representing combinations of government policies aimed at mitigating potential risks during future epidemics or pandemics. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through a comprehensive case study conducted in T & uuml;rkiye, comparing several modeling approaches. Extensive experiments under different types of uncertainties are performed to assess MSC viability. Computational analysis reveals that the URSP approach provides more robust and computationally tractable solutions than the purely stochastic approach and offers more cost-effective kit allocation decisions than the purely robust approach by allowing decision-makers to fine-tune the robustness level based on their priorities. The insights indicate that integrating ML predictions with URSP significantly enhances MSC viability to withstand deep uncertainties during pandemics.

AB This review focuses on the critical role of potassium (K) in potato cultivation, addressing its essential functions in plant metabolism and the challenges in managing soil K levels, specifically under sandy soils. The K use efficiency is higher in potatoes, with the maximum potential up to 55%, compared to cereals at 19%. Potatoes require high quantities of K, especially in well-drained sandy soils, to maximise growth and yield. Because K is a highly leaching-prone nutrient in these soils, its deficiencies could affect plant health, metabolism (K is required to activate more than 60 enzymes) and productivity. Optimal potato growth necessitates maintaining 1.8% K in the tubers, corresponding to a need of 0.22 kg K2O ac-1 for a substantial yield. The review article highlights the significant use of potash fertilisers in the United States, with an average consumption of 4.43 million metric tons between 2010 and 2021, underscoring the importance of K in agricultural practices. The paper also highlights the difference in K requirement and removal among different potato varieties that require the maximum amount in processing types. This manuscript discusses K's management schemes through soil testing, plant tissue analysis and artificial intelligence. The integration of various machine-learning methods could offer promising prospects for predicting K response in potatoes, aiming to improve nutrient management and sustainable crop production. By synthesising current knowledge and advancements in K fertilisation techniques, this paper provides insights into overcoming the challenges of K management in potato cultivation, ultimately contributing to increased productivity and improved crop quality.

AB We introduce a hybrid model that synergistically combines machine learning (ML) with semiconductor device physics to simulate nanoscale transistors. This approach integrates a physics-based (PB) ballistic transistor model with an ML model that predicts ballisticity, enabling flexibility to interface the model with device data. The inclusion of device physics not only enhances the interpretability of the ML model but also streamlines its training process, reducing the necessity for extensive training data. The model's effectiveness is validated on both silicon nanotransistors and carbon nanotube (CNT) field-effect transistors (FETs), demonstrating high model accuracy with a simplified ML component. We assess the impacts of various ML models-multilayer perceptron (MLP), recurrent neural network (RNN), and RandomForestRegressor (RFR)-on predictive accuracy and training data requirements. Notably, hybrid models incorporating these components can maintain high accuracy with a small training dataset, with the RNN-based model exhibiting better accuracy compared with the MLP and RFR models. The trained hybrid model provides significant speedup compared to device simulations and can be applied to predict circuit characteristics based on the modeled nanotransistors.

AB Artificial neural networks have received considerable attention in recent years as their particular properties have come to be recognised, especially their ability to learn and tolerance to noise. In this paper, we describe how some of the properties of neural networks can be used to assist the medicinal chemist in the design of drugs. Specifically, the back propagation neural network has been used to determine the partition coefficient and aqueous solubility of a number of organic compounds. The partition coefficient and aqueous solubility were chosen since they are known to correlate well with biological activity. The results obtained show that the neural network after training can be used to determine the partition coefficient and solubility of a series of unknown compounds to an accuracy comparable to the experimental error.
   Using the partition coefficient data we have conducted an extended series of experiments into the effect that network parameters have on performance. The results show that performance of the neural network can be significantly affected by the choice of network parameters.
   In conclusion, we propose a system for predicting pharmacological activity incorporating an expert system and multiple neural networks and describe the benefits that such a system may offer.

AB Discovery of domain principles has been a major long-term goal for scientists. This paper presents a new system named DOMRUL for learning such principles in the form of rules. A distinctive feature of the system is the integration of the certainty factor (CF) model and a neural network. These two elements complement each other. The CF model offers the neural network better semantics and generalization advantage, and the neural network overcomes possible limitations such as inaccuracies and overcounting of evidence associated with certainty factors. It is a major contribution of this paper to show mathematically the quantizability nature of the CFNet since previously the quantizability of the CF model was demonstrated only empirically. The rule discovery system can be applied to any domain without restriction on both the rule number and rule size, In a hypothetical domain, DOMRUL discovered complex domain rules at a considerably higher accuracy than a commonly used rule-learning program C4.5 in both normal and noisy conditions, The scalability in a large domain is also shown. On a real data set concerning promoters prediction in molecular biology, DOMRUL learned rules with more complete semantics than C4.5.

AB Weed interference during crop establishment is a serious concern for Florida strawberry [Fragariaxananassa (Weston) Duchesne ex Rozier (pro sp.) [chiloensisxvirginiana]] producers. In situ remote detection for precision herbicide application reduces both the risk of crop injury and herbicide inputs. Carolina geranium (Geranium carolinianum L.) is a widespread broadleaf weed within Florida strawberry production with sensitivity to clopyralid, the only available POST broadleaf herbicide. Geranium carolinianum leaf structure is distinct from that of the strawberry plant, which makes it an ideal candidate for pattern recognition in digital images via convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The study objective was to assess the precision of three CNNs in detecting G. carolinianum. Images of G. carolinianum growing in competition with strawberry were gathered at four sites in Hillsborough County, FL. Three CNNs were compared, including object detection-based DetectNet, image classification-based VGGNet, and GoogLeNet. Two DetectNet networks were trained to detect either leaves or canopies of G. carolinianum. Image classification using GoogLeNet and VGGNet was largely unsuccessful during validation with whole images (Fscore<0.02). CNN training using cropped images increased G. carolinianum detection during validation for VGGNet (Fscore=0.77) and GoogLeNet (Fscore=0.62). The G. carolinianum leaf-trained DetectNet achieved the highest Fscore (0.94) for plant detection during validation. Leaf-based detection led to more consistent detection of G. carolinianum within the strawberry canopy and reduced recall-related errors encountered in canopy-based training. The smaller target of leaf-based DetectNet did increase false positives, but such errors can be overcome with additional training images for network desensitization training. DetectNet was the most viable CNN tested for image-based remote sensing of G. carolinianum in competition with strawberry. Future research will identify the optimal approach for in situ detection and integrate the detection technology with a precision sprayer.

AB Evapotranspiration is a key component of the hydrologic cycle. Accurate short-, medium-, and long-term forecasts of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) are crucial not only for quantifying the impacts of climate change on the water and energy balance, but also for real-time estimation of crop water demand and irrigation water allocation in agriculture. Despite considerable advances in satellite remote sensing technology and the availability of long ground-measured and remotely sensed ETa timeseries, real-time ETa forecasts are deficient. Applying a state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) approach, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models were employed to nowcast (realtime) and forecast (ahead of time) ETa based on (1) major meteorological and ground-measured (i.e., soil moisture) input variables and (2) long ETa time-series from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectmradiometer (MODIS) onboard of the NASA Aqua satellite. The conventional LSTM and convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) DL models were evaluated for seven distinct climatic zones across the contiguous United States. The employed LSTM and ConvLSTM models were trained and evaluated with data from the National Climate Assessment-Land Data Assimilation System (NCA-LDAS) and with MODIS/Aqua Net Evapotranspiration MYD16A2 product data. The obtained results indicate that when major atmospheric and soil moisture input variables are used for the conventional LSTM models, they yield accurate daily ETa forecasts for short (1, 3, and 7 days) and medium (30 days) time scales, with normalized root mean squared errors (NRMSE) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiencies (NSE) of less than 10% and greater than 0.77, respectively. At the watershed scale, the univariate ConvLSTM models yielded accurate weekly spatiotemporal ETa forecasts (mean NRMSE less than 6.4% and NSE greater than 0.66) with higher computational efficiency for various climatic conditions. The employed models enable precise forecasts of both the current and future states of ETa, which is crucial for understanding the impact of climate change on rapidly depleting water resources.

AB To reduce life threats and financial losses under hurricane weather and traffic conditions, stakeholders need to make a sequence of decisions (e.g., enforcing traffic control and/or broadcasting travel advisory) with the presence of various uncertainties, which could be formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP). To effectively solve the MDP for optimal operation of hurricane-impacted transportation networks, a risk-informed decision-support framework is proposed consisting of both a decision-making environment and tool. The decision-making environment involves essentially three coupled modules of hurricane hazard, transportation infrastructure, and traffic flow, where the uncertainties from natural environment, built environment, and human behavior are examined. Specifically, multiple correlated hazards for each specific storm are capsulated in the hurricane hazard module, representative hurricane-vulnerable infrastructure components and associated moving vehicles are evaluated in the transportation infrastructure module, and network-level traffic relations are addressed in the traffic flow module. In view of the complexity and intractability of a hurricane-transportation infrastructure-traffic system through full model representation, the efficient low-dimensional modeling approaches including both physics-based analytical and data-driven surrogate models are utilized in all these three simulation modules. Considering an explicit probabilistic model for the decision-making environment (and hence state transition function) is not available, the operation optimization (involving competing objectives of traffic safety and mobility) is accomplished through a deep reinforcement learning-based decision-making tool that learns to act optimally (involving both traffic control and travel advisory actions) by directly interacting with the environment. A hypothetical case study is conducted to verify the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed framework as a testbed for optimal operation of hurricane-impacted transportation networks.

AB Deep learning systems are susceptible to evasion attacks, which represent a significant category of security vulnerabilities. These attacks entail the alteration of input data in such a way that the victim deep neural network (DNN) misclassifies it. Researchers have devised detection and defense methods to counter evasion attacks; however, these techniques impose a significant computational burden and are not suitable for real-time detection on devices with limited resources. This article presents an infrastructure, ${\mathrm{G{\scriptstyle ERALT}}}$ designed to improve the efficiency of evasion attack detection for real-time execution on edge devices. It involves a partition analysis that optimizes detection methods and allows for the use of a smaller detection network. Additionally, we propose a hardware architecture that accelerates internetwork inference using intermediate data reuse techniques and enables a different pattern of model updates between cloud servers and edge devices in real-world applications. Furthermore, it is also extended to a principle of internetwork accelerator design, which is evaluated at different PE ratios. Our evaluations demonstrate that ${\mathrm{G{\scriptstyle ERALT}}}$ achieves more than $3\times $ improvement in performance compared to standard accelerators like Eyeriss, without affecting detection and classification accuracy. The boosted model update system avoids the bandwidth limit between edge devices and the cloud server, saving 14 h when updating the model for a new evasion attack.

TI Sim-to-real localization: Environment resilient deep ensemble learning
   for guided wave damage localization
SO JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
LA English
DT Article
ID NEURAL-NETWORKS; MISMATCH; NOISE
AB Guided ultrasonic wave localization systems use spatially distributed sensor arrays and wave propagation models to detect and locate damage across a structure. Environmental and operational conditions, such as temperature or stress variations, introduce uncertainty into guided wave data and reduce the effectiveness of these localization systems. These uncertainties cause the models used by each localization algorithm to fail to match with reality. This paper addresses this challenge with an ensemble deep neural network that is trained solely with simulated data. Relative to delay-and-sum and matched field processing strategies, this approach is demonstrated to be more robust to temperature variations in experimental data. As a result, this approach demonstrates superior accuracy with small numbers of sensors and greater resilience to spatially nonhomogeneous temperature variations over time.

AB The development of accurate and transferable machine learning (ML) potentials for predicting molecular energetics is a challenging task. The process of data generation to train such ML potentials is a task neither well understood nor researched in detail. In this work, we present a fully automated approach for the generation of datasets with the intent of training universal ML potentials. It is based on the concept of active learning (AL) via Query by Committee (QBC), which uses the disagreement between an ensemble of ML potentials to infer the reliability of the ensemble's prediction. QBC allows the presented AL algorithm to automatically sample regions of chemical space where the ML potential fails to accurately predict the potential energy. AL improves the overall fitness of ANAKIN-ME (ANI) deep learning potentials in rigorous test cases by mitigating human biases in deciding what new training data to use. AL also reduces the training set size to a fraction of the data required when using naive random sampling techniques. To provide validation of our AL approach, we develop the COmprehensive Machine-learning Potential (COMP6) benchmark (publicly available on GitHub) which contains a diverse set of organic molecules. Active learning-based ANI potentials outperform the original random sampled ANI-1 potential with only 10% of the data, while the final active learning-based model vastly outperforms ANI-1 on the COMP6 benchmark after training to only 25% of the data. Finally, we show that our proposed AL technique develops a universal ANI potential (ANI-1x) that provides accurate energy and force predictions on the entire COMP6 benchmark. This universal ML potential achieves a level of accuracy on par with the best ML potentials for single molecules or materials, while remaining applicable to the general class of organic molecules composed of the elements CHNO.

AB Nutrient assessment of plants, a key aspect of agricultural crop management and varietal development programs, traditionally is time demanding and labor-intensive. This study proposes a novel methodology to determine leaf nutrient concentrations of citrus trees by using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral imagery and artificial intelligence (AI). The study was conducted in four different citrus field trials, located in Highlands County and in Polk County, Florida, USA. In each location, trials contained either 'Hamlin' or 'Valencia' sweet orange scion grafted on more than 30 different rootstocks. Leaves were collected and analyzed in the laboratory to determine macro- and micronutrient concentration using traditional chemical methods. Spectral data from tree canopies were obtained in five different bands (red, green, blue, red edge and near-infrared wavelengths) using a UAV equipped with a multispectral camera. The estimation model was developed using a gradient boosting regression tree and evaluated using several metrics including mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error, MAPE-coefficient of variance (CV) ratio and difference plot. This novel model determined macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, calcium and sulfur) with high precision (less than 9% and 17% average error for the 'Hamlin' and 'Valencia' trials, respectively) and micro-nutrients with moderate precision (less than 16% and 30% average error for 'Hamlin' and 'Valencia' trials, respectively). Overall, this UAV- and AI-based methodology was efficient to determine nutrient concentrations and generate nutrient maps in commercial citrus orchards and could be applied to other crop species.

TI Physically adversarial thermal hydraulics evaluation of deep learning

SO PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR ENERGY
LA English
DT Article
DE Deep Learning; Neural Networks; Neutronics
AB LatticeNet is a hierarchical deep learning architecture which has been developed for predicting pin powers and other parameters within single or multiple 2D pressurized water reactor assemblies. It has been shown to be effective at the task of predicting distributions of reactor parameters such as normalized pin powers under changing thermal hydraulics conditions. However, deep learning models are prone to overfitting and to learning rules in the dataset which are either not applicable to the real world or not what the researchers intended. When developing deep learning architectures for reactor modeling and simulation applications it is important to investigate how well these models perform on unseen data which lies outside of their training distribution. In this work, we develop multiple thermal hydraulic datasets which are specifically tailored to provide challenging inference examples, and evaluate these datasets using existing trained LatticeNet models in order to determine how well these models perform on classes of examples which are either statistically unlikely or impossible to be in the training data. We show that these models exhibit surprising generalization capabilities for data outside of their training distribution, and moreover that the error of these examples is not entirely random but semi-continuous. We also show that at least some variants of LatticeNet are particularly vulnerable to adversarial inputs which cause them to produce non-physical answers, and demonstrate a simple method to detect these non-physical regions which requires no generation of new data.

AB Objective To build the Wisconsin Stone Quality of Life Machine-Learning Algorithm (WISQOL-MLA) to predict urolithiasis patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) based on demographic, symptomatic and clinical data collected for the validation of the Wisconsin Stone Quality-of-Life (WISQOL) questionnaire, an HRQoL measurement tool designed specifically for patients with kidney stones.
   Material and Methods We used data from 3206 stone patients from 16 centres. We used gradient-boosting and deep-learning models to predict HRQoL scores. We also stratified HRQoL scores by quintile. The dataset was split using a standard 70%/10%/20% training/validation/testing ratio. Regression performance was evaluated using Pearson's correlation. Classification was evaluated with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUROC).
   Results Gradient boosting obtained a test correlation of 0.62. Deep learning obtained a correlation of 0.59. Multivariate regression achieved a correlation of 0.44. Quintile stratification of all patients in the WISQOL dataset obtained an average test AUROC of 0.70 for the five classes. The model performed best in identifying the lowest (0.79) and highest quintiles (0.83) of HRQoL. Feature importance analysis showed that the model weighs in clinically relevant factors to estimate HRQoL, such as symptomatic status, body mass index and age.
   Conclusions Harnessing the power of the WISQOL questionnaire, our initial results indicate that the WISQOL-MLA can adequately predict a stone patient's HRQoL from readily available clinical information. The algorithm adequately relies on relevant clinical factors to make its HRQoL predictions. Future improvements to the model are needed for direct clinical applications.

AB The concept of the exposome encompasses the totality of exposures from a variety of external and internal sources across an individual's life course. The wealth of existing spatial and contextual data makes it appealing to characterize individuals' external exposome to advance our understanding of environmental determinants of health. However, the spatial and contextual exposome is very different from other exposome factors measured at the individual-level as spatial and contextual exposome data are more heterogenous with unique correlation structures and various spatiotemporal scales. These distinctive characteristics lead to multiple unique methodological challenges across different stages of a study. This article provides a review of the existing resources, methods, and tools in the new and developing field for spatial and contextual exposome-health studies focusing on four areas: (1) data engineering, (2) spatiotemporal data linkage, (3) statistical methods for exposome-health association studies, and (4) machine- and deep-learning methods to use spatial and contextual exposome data for disease prediction. A critical analysis of the methodological challenges involved in each of these areas is performed to identify knowledge gaps and address future research needs.

AB Purpose: An estimated $1.5 billion is spent annually for direct medical expenses and an additional $2.5 billion for indirect costs for the management of prostate cancer. Today there are several procedures for staging prostate cancer, including lymph node dissection. Despite these procedures, the accuracy of predicting extracapsular disease remains low (range 37 to 63, mean 45%). Use of multiple staging procedures adds significantly to the costs of managing prostate cancer. Recently artificial intelligence based neural networks have become available for medical applications. Unlike traditional statistical methods, these networks do not assume linearity or homogeneity of variance and, thus, they are more accurate for clinical data. We applied this concept to staging localized prostate cancer and devised an algorithm that can be used for prostate cancer staging.
   Materials and Methods: Our study comprised 1,200 men with clinically organ confined prostate cancer who underwent preoperative staging using serum prostate specific antigen, systematic biopsy and Gleason scoring before radical prostatectomy and lymphadenectomy. The performance of the neural network was validated for a subset of patients and network predictions were compared with actual pathological stage. Mean patient age was 62.9 years, mean serum prostate specific antigen 8.1 ng./ml. and mean biopsy Gleason 6. Of the patients 55% had organ confined disease, 27% positive margins, 8% seminal vesicle involvement and 7% lymph node disease. Of margin positive patients 30% also had seminal vesicle involvement, while of seminal vesicle positive patients 50% also had positive margins.
   Results: The sensitivity of the network was 81 to 100%, and specificity was 72 to 75% for various predictions of margin, seminal vesicle and lymph node involvement. The negative predictive values tended to be relatively high for all 3 features (range 92 to 100%). The neural network missed only 8% of patients with margin positive disease, and 2% with lymph node and 0% with seminal vesicle involvement.
   Conclusions: Our study suggests that neural networks may be useful as an initial staging tool for detection of extracapsular extension in patients with clinically organ confined prostate cancer. These networks preclude unnecessary staging tests for 63% of patients with clinically organ confined prostate cancer.

AB Tomato fungal diseases can cause significant economic losses to farmers. Advanced disease detection methods based on symptom recognition in images face challenges when identifying fungal diseases in tomatoes, especially with limited training images. This study utilized novel techniques designed for limited data scenarios, such as one-shot and few-shot learning, to identify three tomato fungal diseases, i.e., Alternaria solani, Alternaria alternata, and Botrytis cinerea. Automated feature extraction was performed using the ResNet-12 deep model, and a cosine similarity approach was employed during shot learning. The accuracy of diagnosing the three diseases and healthy leaves using the 4-way 1-shot learning method was 91.64, 92.37, 92.93, and 100%. For the 4-way 3-shot learning method, the accuracy improved to 92.75, 95.07, 96.63, and 100%, respectively. These results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively reduces the dependence on experts labeling images, working well with small datasets and enhancing plant disease identification.

AB Conditional independence mixture models (CIMMs) are an important class of statistical models used in many fields of science. We introduce a novel unsupervised machine learning technique called the independent classifier networks (InClass nets) technique for the nonparameteric estimation of CIMMs. InClass nets consist of multiple independent classifier neural networks (NNs), which are trained simultaneously using suitable cost functions. Leveraging the ability of NNs to handle high-dimensional data, the conditionally independent variates of the model are allowed to be individually high-dimensional, which is the main advantage of the proposed technique over existing non-machine-learning-based approaches. Two new theorems on the nonparametric identifiability of bivariate CIMMs are derived in the form of a necessary and a (different) sufficient condition for a bivariate CIMM to be identifiable. We use the InClass nets technique to perform CIMM estimation successfully for several examples. We provide a public implementation as a Python package called RainDancesVI.

AB Strawberry is ranked third in the value of production of the crops in Florida, USA. Classifying strawberry maturity and monitoring strawberry growth status in the field is very critical for accurate strawberry yield prediction, efficient strawberry field management, and achieving the highest crop production. The traditional method of distinguishing strawberry maturity is based on either physical appearance or internal chemical substance content. However, the traditional method is time-consuming and costly. In this research, an automatic strawberry maturity classification system was developed for the rapid and accurate classification of different strawberry maturity stages. A state-of-the-art deep learning method, You Only Look Once (YOLOv3), which is good at small object detection, was trained and applied to detect strawberry flowers and strawberry fruit at different maturity stages. Two strawberry image acquisition methods, aerial imaging and near-ground imaging, were compared by using the same deep learning image processing method. As a result, three and seven strawberry maturity stages were classified for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images and near-ground digital camera images, respectively. For UAV images, the highest mean average precision (mAP) of strawberry maturity classification was 0.88 for a test data set at 2 m, and the highest classification average precision (AP) was 0.93 for fully matured fruit. For near-ground digital camera images, the mAP of strawberry maturity classification was 0.89, and the highest classification AP was 0.94 for fully matured fruit as well. The result shows that YOLOv3 is an excellent approach for strawberry maturity classification on both image types.

AB Reinforcement learning (RL) has had mixed success when applied to games. Large state spaces and the curse of dimensionality have limited the ability for RL techniques to learn to play complex games in a reasonable length of time. We discuss a modification of Q-learning to use nearest neighbor states to exploit previous experience in the early stages of learning. A weighting on the state features is learned using metric learning techniques, such that neighboring states represent similar game situations. Our method is tested on the arcade game Frogger, and it is shown that some of the effects of the curse of dimensionality can be mitigated.

AB The goal of the study was to explore the factors that explain users' trust and usage intent of the leading explainable artificial intelligence (AI) fake news detection technology. Toward this end, we examined the relationships between various human factors and software-related factors using a survey. The regression models showed that users' trust levels in the software were influenced by both individuals' inherent characteristics and their perceptions of the AI application. Users' adoption intention was ultimately influenced by trust in the detector, which explained a significant amount of the variance. We also found that trust levels were higher when users perceived the application to be highly competent at detecting fake news, be highly collaborative, and have more power in working autonomously. Our findings indicate that trust is a focal element in determining users' behavioral intentions. We argue that identifying positive heuristics of fake news detection technology is critical for facilitating the diffusion of AI-based detection systems in fact-checking.

AB This work explores the distributed state estimation problem for an uncertain, nonlinear, and continuous-time system. Given a sensor network, each agent is assigned a deep neural network (DNN) that is used to approximate the system's dynamics. Each agent updates the weights of their DNN through a multiple timescale approach, i.e., the outer layer weights are updated online with a Lyapunov-based gradient descent update law, and the inner layer weights are updated concurrently using a supervised learning strategy. To promote the efficient use of network resources, the distributed observer uses event-triggered communication. A nonsmooth Lyapunov analysis demonstrates that the distributed event-triggered observer achieves uniformly ultimately bounded state reconstruction. A simulation example of a five-agent sensor network estimating the state of a two-link robotic manipulator tracking a desired trajectory is provided to validate the result and showcase the performance improvements afforded by DNNs.

ID SYSTEM
AB Objective: To develop soft prompt-based learning architecture for large language models (LLMs), examine prompt-tuning using frozen/unfrozen LLMs, and assess their abilities in transfer learning and few-shot learning. Methods: We developed a soft prompt-based learning architecture and compared 4 strategies including (1) finetuning without prompts; (2) hard-prompting with unfrozen LLMs; (3) soft-prompting with unfrozen LLMs; and (4) soft-prompting with frozen LLMs. We evaluated GatorTron, a clinical LLM with up to 8.9 billion parameters, and compared GatorTron with 4 existing transformer models for clinical concept and relation extraction on 2 benchmark datasets for adverse drug events and social determinants of health (SDoH). We evaluated the few-shot learning ability and generalizability for cross-institution applications. Results and Conclusion: When LLMs are unfrozen, GatorTron-3.9B with soft prompting achieves the best strict F1scores of 0.9118 and 0.8604 for concept extraction, outperforming the traditional fine-tuning and hard promptbased models by 0.6 - 3.1 % and 1.2 - 2.9 %, respectively; GatorTron-345 M with soft prompting achieves the best F1-scores of 0.8332 and 0.7488 for end-to-end relation extraction, outperforming other two models by 0.2 - 2 % and 0.6 - 11.7 %, respectively. When LLMs are frozen, small LLMs have a big gap to be competitive with unfrozen models; scaling LLMs up to billions of parameters makes frozen LLMs competitive with unfrozen models. Soft prompting with a frozen GatorTron-8.9B model achieved the best performance for cross-institution evaluation. We demonstrate that (1) machines can learn soft prompts better than hard prompts composed by human, (2) frozen LLMs have good few-shot learning ability and generalizability for cross-institution applications, (3) frozen LLMs reduce computing cost to 2.5 - 6 % of previous methods using unfrozen LLMs, and (4) frozen LLMs require large models (e.g., over several billions of parameters) for good performance.

AB Objective To develop and validate a machine-learning algorithm to improve prediction of incident OUD diagnosis among Medicare beneficiaries with >= 1 opioid prescriptions. Methods This prognostic study included 361,527 fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries, without cancer, filling >= 1 opioid prescriptions from 2011-2016. We randomly divided beneficiaries into training, testing, and validation samples. We measured 269 potential predictors including socio-demographics, health status, patterns of opioid use, and provider-level and regional-level factors in 3-month periods, starting from three months before initiating opioids until development of OUD, loss of follow-up or end of 2016. The primary outcome was a recorded OUD diagnosis or initiating methadone or buprenorphine for OUD as proxy of incident OUD. We applied elastic net, random forests, gradient boosting machine, and deep neural network to predict OUD in the subsequent three months. We assessed prediction performance using C-statistics and other metrics (e.g., number needed to evaluate to identify an individual with OUD [NNE]). Beneficiaries were stratified into subgroups by risk-score decile. Results The training (n = 120,474), testing (n = 120,556), and validation (n = 120,497) samples had similar characteristics (age >= 65 years = 81.1%; female = 61.3%; white = 83.5%; with disability eligibility = 25.5%; 1.5% had incident OUD). In the validation sample, the four approaches had similar prediction performances (C-statistic ranged from 0.874 to 0.882); elastic net required the fewest predictors (n = 48). Using the elastic net algorithm, individuals in the top decile of risk (15.8% [n = 19,047] of validation cohort) had a positive predictive value of 0.96%, negative predictive value of 99.7%, and NNE of 104. Nearly 70% of individuals with incident OUD were in the top two deciles (n = 37,078), having highest incident OUD (36 to 301 per 10,000 beneficiaries). Individuals in the bottom eight deciles (n = 83,419) had minimal incident OUD (3 to 28 per 10,000). Conclusions Machine-learning algorithms improve risk prediction and risk stratification of incident OUD in Medicare beneficiaries.

AB Background Plant architecture can influence crop yield and quality. Manual extraction of architectural traits is, however, time-consuming, tedious, and error prone. The trait estimation from 3D data addresses occlusion issues with the availability of depth information while deep learning approaches enable learning features without manual design. The goal of this study was to develop a data processing workflow by leveraging 3D deep learning models and a novel 3D data annotation tool to segment cotton plant parts and derive important architectural traits.
   Results The Point Voxel Convolutional Neural Network (PVCNN) combining both point- and voxel-based representations of 3D data shows less time consumption and better segmentation performance than point-based networks. Results indicate that the best mIoU (89.12%) and accuracy (96.19%) with average inference time of 0.88 s were achieved through PVCNN, compared to Pointnet and Pointnet++. On the seven derived architectural traits from segmented parts, an R-2 value of more than 0.8 and mean absolute percentage error of less than 10% were attained.
   Conclusion This plant part segmentation method based on 3D deep learning enables effective and efficient architectural trait measurement from point clouds, which could be useful to advance plant breeding programs and characterization of in-season developmental traits. The plant part segmentation code is available at https://github.com/UGA-.BSAIL/plant_3d_deep_learning.

AB Ambient Intelligence (AmI) is a new paradigm in information technology aimed at empowering people's capabilities by means of digital environments that are sensitive, adaptive, and responsive to human needs, habits, gestures, and emotions. This futuristic vision of daily environment will enable innovative human-machine interactions characterized by pervasive, unobtrusive, and anticipatory communications. Such innovative interaction paradigms make AmI technology a suitable candidate for developing various real life solutions, including in the healthcare domain. This survey will discuss the emergence of AmI techniques in the healthcare domain, in order to provide the research community with the necessary background. We will examine the infrastructure and technology required for achieving the vision of AmI, such as smart environments and wearable medical devices. We will summarize the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies used for developing AmI system in the healthcare domain, including various learning techniques (for learning from user interaction), reasoning techniques (for reasoning about users' goals and intensions), and planning techniques (for planning activities and interactions). We will also discuss how AmI technology might support people affected by various physical or mental disabilities or chronic disease. Finally, we will point to some of the successful case studies in the area and we will look at the current and future challenges to draw upon the possible future research paths.

AB PurposePredicting urinary retention is difficult. The aim of this study is to prospectively validate a previously developed model using machine learning techniques.MethodsPatients were recruited from pre-operative clinic. Prediction of urinary retention was completed pre-operatively by 4 individuals and compared to ground truth POUR outcomes. Inter-rater reliability was calculated with intercorrelation coefficient (2,1).Results171 patients were included with age 63 +/- 14 years, 58.5% (100/171) male, BMI 30.4 +/- 5.9 kg/m2, American Society of Anesthesiologists class 2.6 +/- 0.5, 1.7 +/- 1.0 levels, 56% (96/171) fusions. The observed rate of POUR was 25.7%. The model's performance was found to be 0.663 (0.567-0.759). With a regression model probability cutoff of 0.24 and a neural network cutoff of 0.23, the following predictive power was achieved: specificity 90.6%, sensitivity 22.7%, negative predictive value 77.2%, positive predictive value 45.5%, and accuracy 73.1%. Intercorrelation coefficient for the regression aspect of the model was found to be 0.889 and intercorrelation coefficient for the neural network aspect of the model was found to be 0.874.ConclusionsThis prospective study confirms performance of the prediction model for POUR developed with retrospective data, showing great correlation. This supports the use of machine learning techniques in the prediction of postoperative complications such as urinary retention.

AB The continuous convergence of machine learning algorithms, 5G and beyond (5G+) wireless communications, and artificial intelligence (AI) hardware implementation hastens the birth of federated learning (FL) over 5G+ mobile devices, which pushes AI functions to mobile devices and initiates a new era of on-device AI applications. Despite the remarkable progress made in FL, huge energy consumption is one of the most significant obstacles restricting the development of FL over battery-constrained 5G+ mobile devices. To address this issue, in this article, we investigate how to develop energy- efficient FL over 5G+ mobile devices by making a trade-off between energy consumption for "working " (i.e., local computing) and that for "talking " (i.e., wireless communications) in order to boost the overall energy efficiency. Specifically, we first examine energy consumption models for GPU computation and wireless transmissions. Then, we overview the state of the art of integrating FL procedure with energy-efficient learning techniques (gradient sparsification, weight quantization, pruning, etc.). Finally, we present several potential future research directions for FL over 5G+ mobile devices from the perspective of energy efficiency.

AB Premise: One of the slowest steps in digitizing natural history collections is converting labels associated with specimens into a digital data record usable for collections management and research. Here, we address how herbarium specimen labels can be converted into digital data records via extraction into standardized Darwin Core fields.
   Methods: We first showcase the development of a rule-based approach and compare outcomes with a large language model-based approach, in particular ChatGPT4. We next quantified omission and commission error rates across target fields for a set of labels transcribed using optical character recognition (OCR) for both approaches. For example, we find that ChatGPT4 often creates field names that are not Darwin Core compliant while rule-based approaches often have high commission error rates.
   Results: Our results suggest that these approaches each have different strengths and limitations. We therefore developed an ensemble approach that leverages the strengths of each individual method and documented that ensembling strongly reduced overall information extraction errors.
   Discussion: This work shows that an ensemble approach has particular value for creating high-quality digital data records, even for complicated label content. While human validation is still needed to ensure the best possible quality, automated approaches can speed digitization of herbarium specimen labels and are likely to be broadly usable for all natural history collection types.

ID ALGORITHM; OPTIMIZATION; SEARCH
AB In this paper we propose some non-greedy heuristics and develop an Augmented-Neural-Network (AugNN) formulation for solving the classical open-shop scheduling problem (OSSP). AugNN is a neural network based meta-heuristic approach that allows integration of domain-specific knowledge. The OSSP is framed as a neural network with multiple layers of jobs and machines. Input, output and activation functions are designed to enforce the problem constraints and embed known heuristics to generate a good feasible solution fast. Suitable learning strategies are applied to obtain better neighborhood solutions iteratively. The new heuristics and the AugNN formulation are tested on several benchmark problem instances in the literature and on some new problem instances generated in this study. The results are very competitive with other meta-heuristic approaches, both in terms of solution quality and computational times. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB With artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly advancing, advanced practice nurses must understand and use it responsibly. Here, we describe an assignment in which Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) students learned to use generative text AI. Using our program and course outcomes, developed from the 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) Essentials competency for DNP students to learn and use AI, we reviewed the literature seeking examples using ChatGPT for the DNP informatics course. No published examples existed to guide us toward infusing a ChatGPT assignment into the course. We developed a novel assignment that included a guide for students on how to use ChatGPT. Students were given time before the assignment to learn the AI/chatbot technology. They were then given the assignment and grading rubric. The assignment was to develop a tool for their current or future practice using ChatGPT. During the course faculty debrief, we learned that few students had questions and the assignment was clear. We also learned that students who sought to develop straightforward, uncomplicated patient tools succeeded with the technology. Those who sought to create something for complex patients had more challenges. Nursing education and practice will be influenced by the increasing prevalence of AI. This manuscript outlines an AI-based assignment for graduate nursing education intended for the students to become familiar with current AI and best practices for patient care. The assignment was well received by students. We plan to use it again in the next course offering.

ID SAR ATR; NEURAL NETWORKS; DATA SET; PREDICTION
AB We describe a new architecture for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) automatic target recognition (ATR) based on the premise that the pose of the target is estimated within a high degree of precision. The advantage of our classifier design is that the input space complexity is decreased with the pose information, which enables fewer features to classify targets with a higher degree of accuracy. Moreover, the training of the classifier can be done discriminantly, which also improves performance and decreases the complexity of the classifier. Three strategies of teaming and representation to build the pattern space and discriminant functions are compared: Vapnik's support vector machine (SVM), a newly developed quadratic mutual information (QMI) cost function for neural networks, and a principal component analysis extended recently with multiresolution (PCA-M). Experimental results obtained in the MSTAR database show that the performance of our classifiers is better than that of standard template matching in the same dataset. We also rate the quality of the classifiers for detection using confusers, and show significant improvement in rejection. (C) 2000 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

AR and large language models like GPT have witnessed substantial progress and increasingly are being employed in diverse fields. One such promising application is in operations and maintenance (O&M). O&M tasks often involve complex procedures and sequences that can be challenging to memorize and execute correctly, particularly for novices or in high-stress situations. By combining the advantages of superimposing virtual objects onto the physical world and generating human-like text using GPT, we can revolutionize O&M operations. This study introduces a system that combines AR, optical character recognition (OCR), and the GPT language model to optimize user performance while offering trustworthy interactions and alleviating workload in O&M tasks. This system provides an interactive virtual environment controlled by the Unity game engine, facilitating a seamless interaction between virtual and physical realities. A case study (N=30) was conducted to illustrate the findings and answer the research questions. The Multidimensional Measurement of Trust (MDMT) was applied to understand the complexity of trust engagement with such a human-like system. The results indicate that users can complete similarly challenging tasks in less time using our proposed AR and AI system. Moreover, the collected data also suggest a reduction in cognitive load when executing the same operations using the AR and AI system. A divergence of trust was observed concerning capability and ethical dimensions.

AB Purpose Prior studies show convolutional neural networks predicting self-reported race using x-rays of chest, hand and spine, chest computed tomography, and mammogram. We seek an understanding of the mechanism that reveals race within x-ray images, investigating the possibility that race is not predicted using the physical structure in x-ray images but is embedded in the grayscale pixel intensities.Approach Retrospective full year 2021, 298,827 AP/PA chest x-ray images from 3 academic health centers across the United States and MIMIC-CXR, labeled by self-reported race, were used in this study. The image structure is removed by summing the number of each grayscale value and scaling to percent per image (PPI). The resulting data are tested using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) with Bonferroni multiple-comparison adjustment and class-balanced MANOVA. Machine learning (ML) feed-forward networks (FFN) and decision trees were built to predict race (binary Black or White and binary Black or other) using only grayscale value counts. Stratified analysis by body mass index, age, sex, gender, patient type, make/model of scanner, exposure, and kilovoltage peak setting was run to study the impact of these factors on race prediction following the same methodology.Results MANOVA rejects the null hypothesis that classes are the same with 95% confidence (F 7.38, P < 0.0001) and balanced MANOVA (F 2.02, P < 0.0001). The best FFN performance is limited [area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 69.18%]. Gradient boosted trees predict self-reported race using grayscale PPI (AUROC 77.24%).Conclusions Within chest x-rays, pixel intensity value counts alone are statistically significant indicators and enough for ML classification tasks of patient self-reported race.

AB Background: Febrile neutropenia (FN) has been associated with high mortality among adults with cancer. Current systems for early detection of inpatient FN mortality are based on scoring indexes that require intensive physicians' subjective evaluation.
   Objective: In this study, we leveraged machine learning techniques to build a FN mortality risk evaluation tool focused on FN admissions without physicians' subjective evaluation.
   Methods: We used the National Inpatient Sample and Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) that included mortality data among adult inpatients who were diagnosed with FN during a hospital admission. Machine learning techniques that we compared included linear models (ridge logistic regression and linear support vector machine) and non-linear models (gradient boosting tree and neural network). The primary outcome for this study was death among individuals with a recorded FN admission. Model comparison was evaluated based on areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and model performance was estimated using 30 % test set created via stratified split.
   Results: Our analysis detected 126,013 adult admissions within the NIS data that were diagnosed with FN, among which 5,856 were declared as deceased (4.6 %). Our machine learning results demonstrate linear models and non-linear models achieved areas under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) around 92 % in survival prediction.
   Conclusions: We developed machine learning models that do not require physicians' subjective evaluation for FN mortality risk prediction.

AB Soil organic carbon (SOC) constitutes a fundamental component of terrestrial ecosystem functionality, playing a pivotal role in nutrient cycling, hydrological balance, and erosion mitigation. Precise mapping of SOC distribution is imperative for the quantification of ecosystem services, notably carbon sequestration and soil fertility enhancement. Digital soil mapping (DSM) leverages statistical models and advanced technologies, including machine learning (ML), to accurately map soil properties, such as SOC, utilizing diverse data sources like satellite imagery, topography, remote sensing indices, and climate series. Within the domain of ML, self-supervised learning (SSL), which exploits unlabeled data, has gained prominence in recent years. This study introduces a novel approach that aims to learn the geographical link between multimodal features via self-supervised contrastive learning, employing pretrained Vision Transformers (ViT) for image inputs and Transformers for climate data, before fine-tuning the model with ground reference samples. The proposed approach has undergone rigorous testing on two distinct large-scale datasets, with results indicating its superiority over traditional supervised learning models, which depends solely on labeled data. Furthermore, through the utilization of various evaluation metrics (e.g., root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), etc.), the proposed model exhibits higher accuracy when compared to other conventional ML algorithms like random forest and gradient boosting. This model is a robust tool for predicting SOC and contributes to the advancement of DSM techniques, thereby facilitating land management and decision-making processes based on accurate information.

   piracy; IP protection; logic locking
AB With the emergence of the horizontal business model in the semiconductor industry, numerous hardware security concerns have been emerged, including intellectual property (IP) theft, malicious functionality insertion, and IC overproduction. To combat these threats, logic locking has been introduced as one of the most prominent countermeasures, and advances in logic locking have led the most recent techniques toward higher levels of abstractions, i.e., register transfer language (RTL) or high-level languages (C/C++). In this article, we propose HLock+, a robust logic locking framework at the high-level design language. HLock+ consists of two main parts to achieve multiple goals: 1) Locking in HLock+ is based on a formal analysis over design specifications, assets, and critical operations to determine locking points in the design to provide the best solution in terms of desired attack resiliency (e.g., SAT attacks), and locking key size and 2) we integrate the formal analysis with a point function locking technique, in which the locking candidates have been chosen by an optimization algorithm helping us to boost the efficiency of the approach with the given area, power, and performance constraints. Furthermore, the proposed framework ensures a dynamic/automatic locking solution based on a set of specifications, and it is well suited for large-scale designs. Apart from having lesser development/verification efforts, HLock+ at high-level language will be followed by high-level synthesis (HLS) and RTL synthesis, which provides superior uniform distribution and optimum output corruptibility. We show that HLock+ provides potent robustness against de-obfuscation attacks, e.g., SAT and machine-learning-based attacks, while the overhead is kept low.

AB Education is poised for a transformative shift with the advent of neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (NAI), which will redefine how we support deeply adaptive and personalized learning experiences. The integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with Large Language Models (LLMs), a significant and popular form of NAI, presents a promising avenue for advancing personalized instruction via neurosymbolic educational agents. By leveraging structured knowledge, these agents can provide individualized learning experiences that align with specific learner preferences and desired learning paths, while also mitigating biases inherent in traditional AI systems. NAI-powered education systems will be capable of interpreting complex human concepts and contexts while employing advanced problem-solving strategies, all grounded in established pedagogical frameworks. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages the unique affordances of KGs, LLMs, and pedagogical agents - embodied characters designed to enhance learning - as critical components of a hybrid NAI architecture. We discuss the rationale for our system design and the preliminary findings of our work. We conclude that education in the era of NAI will make learning more accessible, equitable, and aligned with real-world skills. This is an era that will explore a new depth of understanding in educational tools.

AB Neuro-symbolic models combine deep learning and symbolic reasoning to produce better-performing hybrids. Not only do neuro-symbolic models perform better, but they also deal better with data scarcity, enable the direct incorporation of high-level domain knowledge, and are more explainable. However, these benefits come at the cost of increased complexity, which may deter the uninitiated from using these models. In this work, we present a framework to simplify the creation of neuro-symbolic models for tree crown delineation and tree species classification via the use of object-oriented programming and hyperparameter tuning algorithms. We show that models created using our framework outperform their non-neuro-symbolic counterparts by as much as two F1 points for crown delineation and three F1 points for species classification. Furthermore, our use of hyperparameter tuning algorithms allows users to experiment with multiple formulations of domain knowledge without the burden of manual tuning.

AB In this study hyperspectral imaging (380-1020 nm) and machine learning were utilised to develop a technique for detecting different disease development stages (asymptomatic, early, intermediate, and late disease stage) of powdery mildew (PM) in squash. Data were collected in the laboratory as well as in the field using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Radial basis function (RBF) was used to discriminate between healthy and diseased plants, and to classify the severity level (disease stage) of a plant; the most significant bands to differentiate between healthy and different stages of disease development were selected (388 nm, 591 nm, 646 nm, 975 nm, and 1012 nm). Furthermore, 29 spectral vegetation indices (VIs) were tested and evaluated for their ability to detect and classify healthy and PM-infected plants; the M value was used to evaluate the VIs. The water index (WI) and the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) were able to accurately detect and classify PM in asymptomatic, early, and late development stages under laboratory conditions. Under field conditions (UAV-based), the spectral ratio of 761 (SR761) accurately detected PM in early stages, and the chlorophyll index green (CI green), the normalised difference of 750/705 (ND 750/705), the green normalised difference vegetation index (GNDVI), and the spectral ratio of 850 (SR850) in late stages. The classification results, by using RBF, in laboratory conditions for the asymptomatic and late stage was 82% and 99% respectively, while in field conditions it was 89% and 96% in early and late disease development stages, respectively.

AB Animal re-identification remains a challenging problem due to the cost of tagging systems and the difficulty of permanently attaching a physical marker to some animals, such as sea stars. Due to these challenges, photo identification is a good fit to solve this problem whether evaluated by humans or through machine learning. Accurate machine learning methods are an improvement over manual identification as they are capable of evaluating a large number of images automatically and recent advances have reduced the need for large training datasets. This study aimed to create an accurate, robust, general purpose machine learning framework for individual animal re-identification using images both from publicly available data as well as two groups of sea stars of different species under human care. Open-source code was provided to accelerate work in this space. Images of two species of sea star (Asterias rubens and Anthenea australiae) were taken using a consumer-grade smartphone camera and used as original datasets to train a machine learning model to re-identify an individual animal using few examples. The model's performance was evaluated on these original sea star datasets which contained between 39-54 individuals and 983-1204 images, as well as using six publicly available re-identification datasets for tigers, beef cattle noses, chimpanzee faces, zebras, giraffes and ringed seals ranging between 45-2056 individuals and 829-6770 images. Using time aware-splits, which are a data splitting technique ensuring that the model only sees an individual's images from a previous collection event during training to avoid information leaking, the model achieved high (>99%) individual re-identification mean average precision for the top prediction (mAP@1) for the two species of sea stars. The re-identification mAP@1 for the mammalian datasets was more variable, ranging from 83% to >99%. However, this model outperformed published state-of-the-art re-identification results for the publicly available datasets. The reported approach for animal re-identification is generalizable, with the same machine learning framework achieving good performance in two distinct species of sea stars with different physical attributes, as well as seven different mammalian species. This demonstrates that this methodology can be applied to nearly any species where individual re-identification is required. This study presents a precise, practical, non-invasive approach to animal re-identification using only basic image collection methods.

AB Traditional approaches for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) such as brain imaging and cerebrospinal fluid are invasive and expensive. It is desirable to develop a useful diagnostic tool by exploiting biomark-ers obtained from peripheral tissues due to their noninvasive and easily accessible characteristics. However, the capacity of using DNA methylation data in peripheral blood for predicting AD progression is rarely known. It is also challenging to develop an efficient prediction model considering the complex and high-dimensional DNA methylation data in a longitudinal study. Here, we develop two multi-task deep autoencoders, which are based on the convolutional autoencoder and long short-term memory autoencoder to learn the compressed feature representation by jointly minimizing the reconstruction error and maximizing the prediction accuracy. By benchmarking on longitudinal DNA methylation data collected from the peripheral blood in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we demonstrate that the proposed multi-task deep autoencoders outperform state-of-the-art machine learning approaches for both predicting AD progression and reconstructing the temporal DNA methylation profiles. In addition, the proposed multi-task deep autoencoders can predict AD progression accurately using only the histor-ical DNA methylation data and the performance is further improved by including all temporal DNA methylation data.

We present Dynamic Retrieval Augmented Generation of Ontologies using AI (DRAGON-AI), an ontology generation method employing Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). DRAGON-AI can generate textual and logical ontology components, drawing from existing knowledge in multiple ontologies and unstructured text sources.ResultsWe assessed performance of DRAGON-AI on de novo term construction across ten diverse ontologies, making use of extensive manual evaluation of results. Our method has high precision for relationship generation, but has slightly lower precision than from logic-based reasoning. Our method is also able to generate definitions deemed acceptable by expert evaluators, but these scored worse than human-authored definitions. Notably, evaluators with the highest level of confidence in a domain were better able to discern flaws in AI-generated definitions. We also demonstrated the ability of DRAGON-AI to incorporate natural language instructions in the form of GitHub issues.ConclusionsThese findings suggest DRAGON-AI's potential to substantially aid the manual ontology construction process. However, our results also underscore the importance of having expert curators and ontology editors drive the ontology generation process.

AB Q-learning has become an important part of the reinforcement learning toolkit since its introduction in the dissertation of Chris Watkins in the 1980s. In the original tabular formulation, the goal is to compute exactly a solution to the discounted-cost optimality equation, and thereby, obtain the optimal policy for a Markov Decision Process. The goal today is more modest: obtain an approximate solution within a prescribed function class. The standard algorithms are based on the same architecture as formulated in the 1980s, with the goal of finding a value function approximation that solves the so-called projected Bellman equation. While reinforcement learning has been an active research area for over four decades, there is little theory providing conditions for convergence of these Q-learning algorithms, or even existence of a solution to this equation. The purpose of this article is to show that a solution to the projected Bellman equation does exist, provided the function class is linear and the input used for training is a form of $\varepsilon$-greedy policy with sufficiently small $\varepsilon$. Moreover, under these conditions it is shown that the Q-learning algorithm is stable, in terms of bounded parameter estimates. Convergence remains one of many open topics for research.

AB This study presents two different machine learning approaches for the modeling of hydrodynamic force on particles in a particle-laden multiphase flow. Results from particle-resolved direct numerical simulations (PR-DNS) of flow over a random array of stationary particles for eight combinations of particle Reynolds number (Re) and volume fraction (phi) are used in the development of the models. The first approach follows a two-step process. In the first flow prediction step, the perturbation flow due to a particle is obtained as an axisymmetric superposable wake using linear regression. In the second force prediction step, the force on a particle is evaluated in terms of the perturbation flow induced by all its neighbors using the generalized Faxen form of the force expression. In the second approach, the force data on all the particles from the PR-DNS simulations are used to develop an artificial neural network (ANN) model for direct prediction of force on a particle. Due to the unavoidable limitation on the number of fully resolved particles in the PR-DNS simulations, direct force prediction with the ANN model tends to over-fit the data and performs poorly in the prediction of test data. In contrast, due to the millions of grid points used in the PR-DNS simulations, accurate flow prediction is possible, which then allows accurate prediction of particle force. This hybridization of multiphase physics and machine learning is particularly important, since it blends the strength of each, and the resulting pairwise interaction extended point-particle model cannot be developed by either physics or machine learning alone.

AB Synopsis Despite efforts to integrate research across different subdisciplines of biology, the scale of integration remains limited. We hypothesize that future generations of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies specifically adapted for biological sciences will help enable the reintegration of biology. AI technologies will allow us not only to collect, connect, and analyze data at unprecedented scales, but also to build comprehensive predictive models that span various subdisciplines. They will make possible both targeted (testing specific hypotheses) and untargeted discoveries. AI for biology will be the cross-cutting technology that will enhance our ability to do biological research at every scale. We expect AI to revolutionize biology in the 21st century much like statistics transformed biology in the 20th century. The difficulties, however, are many, including data curation and assembly, development of new science in the form of theories that connect the subdisciplines, and new predictive and interpretable AI models that are more suited to biology than existing machine learning and AI techniques. Development efforts will require strong collaborations between biological and computational scientists. This white paper provides a vision for AI for Biology and highlights some challenges.

AB There are many impactful applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in the electronic radiology roundtrip and the patient's journey through the healthcare system that go beyond diagnostic applications. These tools have the potential to improve quality and safety, optimize workflow, increase efficiency, and increase patient satisfaction. In this article, we review the role of AI for process improvement and workflow enhancement which includes applications beginning from the time of order entry, scan acquisition, applications supporting the image interpretation task, and applications supporting tasks after image interpretation such as result communication. These non-diagnostic workflow and process optimization tasks are an important part of the arsenal of potential AI tools that can streamline day to day clinical practice and patient care.Semin Roentgenology 58:158-169 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB In small animal practice, patients often present with urinary lithiasis, and prediction of urolith composition is essential to determine the appropriate treatment. Through abdominal radiographs, the composition of mineral radiopaque uroliths can be determined by considering many different factors; this can be complex and, as such, tailor-made for the use of artificial intelligence (AI). The Minnesota Urolith Center partnered with Hill's Pet Nutrition to develop a deep learning AI algorithm (CALCurad) within a smartphone application called the MN Urolith Application that allows for the preliminary assessment of urolith composition. The algorithm provides the probability of a urolith being composed of struvite from an image taken of an abdominal radiograph. This pilot study evaluates the accuracy of the CALCurad in the context of clinical practice. A sample population of 139 dogs was considered, and the results obtained by the CALCurad were compared with the results obtained by infrared spectroscopy analysis. Agreement between the application and quantitative analyses was 81.3%. These results suggest that the CALCurad can effectively be used to predict urolith composition in dogs, helping the clinician to decide between medical and surgical management of the patient. The use of the CALCurad is an example of the usefulness of AI in helping veterinarians make clinical decisions in patient care.

AB Computer-aided image analysis of histopathology specimens could potentially provide support for early detection and improved characterization of diseases such as brain tumor, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET), and breast cancer. Automated nucleus segmentation is a prerequisite for various quantitative analyses including automatic morphological feature computation. However, it remains to be a challenging problem due to the complex nature of histopathology images. In this paper, we propose a learning-based framework for robust and automatic nucleus segmentation with shape preservation. Given a nucleus image, it begins with a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model to generate a probability map, on which an iterative region merging approach is performed for shape initializations. Next, a novel segmentation algorithm is exploited to separate individual nuclei combining a robust selection-based sparse shape model and a local repulsive deformable model. One of the significant benefits of the proposed framework is that it is applicable to different staining histopathology images. Due to the feature learning characteristic of the deep CNN and the high level shape prior modeling, the proposed method is general enough to perform well across multiple scenarios. We have tested the proposed algorithm on three large-scale pathology image datasets using a range of different tissue and stain preparations, and the comparative experiments with recent state of the arts demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach.

DE scheduling; neural networks; heuristics
ID COMBINATORIAL OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHMS; PROCESSORS; SYSTEMS
AB We propose new heuristics along with an augmented-neural-network (AugNN) formulation for solving the make-span minimization task-scheduling problem for the non-identical machine environment. We explore four task and three machine-priority rules, resulting in 12 combinations of single-pass heuristics. The task-priority rules are Highest-Level-First (HLF), Highest-Total-Remaining-Processing-Time-First (HTRPTF), Smallest-Latest-Finish-Time-First (SLFTF) and Minimum-Slack-First (MSF). For machine priority, we propose a greedy rule called Fastest-Available-Machine-First (FAMF), and two non-greedy rules: (1) Fastest-Available-Machine-First-With-Conditional-Wait-1 (FAMF-CW-1), and (2) Fastest-Available-Machine-First-With-Conditional-Wait-2 (FMF-CW-2). The AugNN approach integrates neural-network learning with domain and problem specific knowledge through heuristics, to produce good results. A single-pass heuristic is embedded in a neural network designed specifically for each problem. We give the AugNN formulation for each of the 12 heuristics and show computational results on 100 randomly generated problems of sizes ranging from 20 to 70 tasks and 2 to 5 machines. Results demonstrate that AugNN provides significant improvement over single-pass heuristics. The reduction in the gap between the obtained solution and the lower-bound due to AugNN over single-pass heuristics ranged from 24.4% to 50%. As far as heuristics, the non-greedy machine-priority rules performed significantly better than the greedy rule. The average gaps for the non-greedy rules ranged from 16.1% to 23.5% compared to 33.7% to 40.4% for greedy. For AugNN, for non-greedy rules, the gap ranged from 11.5% to 15.5% compared to 18.4% to 25.0% for greedy. The HLF and HTRPTF task priority rules performed better than the other two. The HTRPTF/FAMF-CW-1 combination gave the best results, closely followed by HLF/FAMF-CW-2 and HTRPTF/FAMF-CW-2 combinations. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: The application of large language models across commercial and consumer contexts has grown exponentially in recent years. However, a gap exists in the literature on how large language models can support nursing practice, education, and research. This study aimed to synthesize the existing literature on current and potential uses of large language models across the nursing profession. Methods: A rapid review of the literature, guided by Cochrane rapid review methodology and PRISMA reporting standards, was conducted. An expert health librarian assisted in developing broad inclusion criteria to account for the emerging nature of literature related to large language models. Three electronic databases (i.e., PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase) were searched to identify relevant literature in August 2023. Articles that discussed the development, use, and application of large language models within nursing were included for analysis. Results: The literature search identified a total of 2028 articles that met the inclusion criteria. After systematically reviewing abstracts, titles, and full texts, 30 articles were included in the final analysis. Nearly all (93 %; n = 28) of the included articles used ChatGPT as an example, and subsequently discussed the use and value of large language models in nursing education (47 %; n = 14), clinical practice (40 %; n = 12), and research (10 %; n = 3). While the most common assessment of large language models was conducted by human evaluation (26.7 %; n = 8), this analysis also identified common limitations of large language models in nursing, including lack of systematic evaluation, as well as other ethical and legal considerations. Discussion: This is the first review to summarize contemporary literature on current and potential uses of large language models in nursing practice, education, and research. Although there are significant opportunities to apply large language models, the use and adoption of these models within nursing have elicited a series of challenges, such as ethical issues related to bias, misuse, and plagiarism. Conclusion: Given the relative novelty of large language models, ongoing efforts to develop and implement meaningful assessments, evaluations, standards, and guidelines for applying large language models in nursing are recommended to ensure appropriate, accurate, and safe use. Future research along with clinical and educational partnerships is needed to enhance understanding and application of large language models in nursing and healthcare. (c) 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Foundational and state-of-the-art anomaly-detection methods through power system state estimation are reviewed. Traditional components for bad data detection, such as chi-square testing, residual-based methods, and hypothesis testing, are discussed to explain the motivations for recent anomaly-detection methods given the increasing complexity of power grids, energy management systems, and cyber-threats. In particular, state estimation anomaly detection based on data-driven quickest-change detection and artificial intelligence are discussed, and directions for research are suggested with particular emphasis on considerations of the future smart grid.

AB In the creation of a smart future information society, IoT and CCN break two key barriers for both front-end sensing and back-end networking. However, we still observe the missing piece of the research that dominates current networking traffic control and system management, for example, lacking the knowledge penetrated into both sensing and networking to glue them holistically. In this article, we propose leveraging emerging machine learning or deep learning techniques to create aspects of knowledge to facilitate the designs. In particular, we can extract knowledge from collected data to facilitate reduced data volume, enhanced system intelligence and interactivity, improved service quality, communication with better controllability and lower cost. We this knowledge-oriented traffic control and networking management paradigm Knowledge Centric Networking (KCN). This article presents the rationale for KCN, its benefits, related works and research opportunities.

ID KNOWLEDGE
AB A Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) is a powerful technique for modeling and analyzing complex systems. In this study, we propose a novel learning algorithm that, unlike existing FCM-based learning algorithms, ensures matching the desired system state by computing the otherwise "unexplained" biases in the model. Our learning algorithm considers both the whole system bias and the individual biases for each system factor (concept). We explore the impact of FCM structure and characteristics for the proposed algorithm and suggest an interpretation of computed biases. Finally, we propose an FCM visualization technique which enables comparison between and a deeper understanding of modeled systems. As FCMs offer a broader, quantifiable view of the causal relationships between factors, the approach used in this study provides insights into FCM modeling and application to real-world complex systems.

Advances in artificial intelligence have propelled the identification of AKI subphenotypes, enhancing our capacity to customize treatments and predict disease trajectories.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review of the literature from 2017 to 2022, focusing on studies that utilized machine learning techniques to identify AKI subphenotypes in adult patients. Data were extracted regarding patient demographics, clustering methodologies, discriminators, and validation efforts from selected studies.ResultsThe review highlights significant variability in subphenotype identification across different populations. All studies utilized clinical data such as comorbidities and laboratory variables to group patients. Two studies incorporated biomarkers of endothelial activation and inflammation into the clinical data to identify subphenotypes. The primary discriminators were comorbidities and laboratory trajectories. The association of AKI subphenotypes with mortality, renal recovery and treatment response was heterogeneous across studies. The use of diverse clustering techniques contributed to variability, complicating the application of findings across different patient populations.ConclusionsIdentifying AKI subphenotypes enables clinicians to better understand and manage individual patient trajectories. Future research should focus on validating these phenotypes in larger, more diverse cohorts to enhance their clinical applicability and support personalized medicine in AKI management.

AB Malicious software, popularly known as malware, is widely acknowledged as a serious threat to modern computing systems. Software-based solutions, such as anti-virus software (AVS), are not effective since they rely on matching patterns that can be easily fooled by carefully crafted malware with obfuscation or other deviation capabilities. While recent malware detection methods provide promising results through an effective utilization of hardware features, the detection results cannot be interpreted in a meaningful way. In this paper, we propose a hardware-assisted malware detection framework using explainable machine learning. This paper makes three important contributions. First, we theoretically establish that our proposed method can provide an interpretable explanation of classification results to address the challenge of transparency. Next, we show that the explainable outcome through effective utilization of hardware performance counters and embedded trace buffer can lead to accurate localization of malicious behavior. Finally, we have performed efficiency versus accuracy trade-off analysis using decision tree and recurrent neural networks. Extensive evaluation using a wide variety of real-world malware dataset demonstrates that our framework can produce accurate and human-understandable malware detection results with provable guarantees.

AB Electronic healthcare technology is widespread around the world and creates massive potential to improve clinical outcomes and transform care delivery. However, there are increasing concerns with respect to the cyber vulnerabilities of medical tools, malicious medical errors, and security attacks on healthcare data and devices. Increased connectivity to existing computer networks has exposed the medical devices/systems and their communicating data to new cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Adversaries leverage the state-of-the-art technologies, in particular artificial intelligence and computer vision-based techniques, in order to launch stronger and more detrimental attacks on the medical targets. The medical domain is an attractive area for cybercrimes for two fundamental reasons: (a) it is rich resource of valuable and sensitive data; and (b) its protection and defensive mechanisms are weak and ineffective. The attacks aim to steal health information from the patients, manipulate the medical information and queries, maliciously change the medical diagnosis, decisions, and prescriptions, etc. A successful attack in the medical domain causes serious damage to the patient's health and even death. Therefore, cybersecurity is critical to patient safety and every aspect of the medical domain, while it has not been studied sufficiently. To tackle this problem, new human- and computer-based countermeasures are researched and proposed for medical attacks using the most effective software and hardware technologies, such as artificial intelligence and computer vision. This review provides insights to the novel and existing solutions in the literature that mitigate cyber risks, errors, damage, and threats in the medical domain. We have performed a scoping review analyzing the four major elements in this area (in order from a medical perspective): (1) medical errors; (2) security weaknesses of medical devices at software- and hardware-level; (3) artificial intelligence and/or computer vision in medical applications; and (4) cyber attacks and defenses in the medical domain. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence and computer vision are key topics in this review and their usage in all these four elements are discussed. The review outcome delivers the solutions through building and evaluating the connections among these elements in order to serve as a beneficial guideline for medical electronic hardware security.

AB Compact binary representations of histopathology images using hashing methods provide efficient approximate nearest neighbor search for direct visual query in large-scale databases. They can be utilized to measure the probability of the abnormality of the query image based on the retrieved similar cases, thereby providing support for medical diagnosis. They also allow for efficient managing of large-scale image databases because of a low storage requirement. However, the effectiveness of binary representations heavily relies on the visual descriptors that represent the semantic information in the histopathological images. Traditional approaches with hand-crafted visual descriptors might fail due to significant variations in image appearance. Recently, deep learning architectures provide promising solutions to address this problem using effective semantic representations. In this paper, we propose a deep convolutional hashing method that can be trained "point-wise" to simultaneously learn both semantic and binary representations of histopathological images. Specifically, we propose a convolutional neural network that introduces a latent binary encoding (LBE) layer for low-dimensional feature embedding to learn binary codes. We design a joint optimization objective function that encourages the network to learn discriminative representations from the label information, and reduce the gap between the real-valued low-dimensional embedded features and desired binary values. The binary encoding for new images can be obtained by forward propagating through the network and quantizing the output of the LBE layer. Experimental results on a large-scale histopathological image dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Product quality is the lifeline of enterprise survival and development. With the rapid development of information technology, the semiconductor manufacturing process produces multitude of quality features. Due to the increasing quality features, the requirement on the training time and classification accuracy of quality prediction methods becomes increasingly higher. Aiming at realizing the quality prediction for semiconductor manufacturing process, this paper proposes a modified support vector machine (SVM) model based on feature selection, considering the high dimensional and nonlinear characteristics of data. The model first improves the Radial Basis Function (RBF) in SVM, and then combines the Duelist algorithm (DA) and variable neighborhood search algorithm (VNS) for feature selection and parameters optimization. Compared with some other SVM models that are based on DA, genetic algorithm (GA), and Information Gain algorithm (IG), the experiment results show that our DA-VNS-SVM can obtain higher classification accuracy rate with a smaller feature subset. In addition, we compare the DA-VNS-SVM with some common machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, naive Bayes, decision tree, random forest, and artificial neural network. The results indicate that our model outperform these machine learning algorithms for the quality prediction of semiconductor.

AB Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technology design and development continues to be rapid, despite major limitations in its current form as a practice and discipline to address all sociohumanitarian issues and complexities. From these limitations emerges an imperative to strengthen AI and ML literacy in underserved communities and build a more diverse AI and ML design and development workforce engaged in health research.
   Objective: AI and ML has the potentialto account for and assess a variety of factors that contribute to health and disease and to improve prevention, diagnosis, and therapy. Here, we describe recent activities within the Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Consortium to Advance Health Equity and Researcher Diversity (AIM-AHEAD) Ethics and Equity Workgroup (EEWG) that led to the development of deliverables that will help put ethics and fairness at the forefront of AI and ML applications to build equity in biomedical research, education, and health care.
   Methods: The AIM-AHEAD EEWG was created in 2021 with 3 cochairs and 51 members in year 1 and 2 cochairs and similar to 40 members in year 2. Members in both years included AIM-AHEAD principal investigators, coinvestigators, leadership fellows, and research fellows. The EEWG used a modified Delphi approach using polling, ranking, and other exercises to facilitate discussions around tangible steps, key terms, and definitions needed to ensure that ethics and fairness are at the forefront of AI and ML applications to build equity in biomedical research, education, and health care.
   Results: The EEWG developed a set of ethics and equity principles, a glossary, and an interview guide. The ethics and equity principles comprise 5 core principles, each with subparts, which articulate best practices for working with stakeholders from historically and presently underrepresented communities. The glossary contains 12 terms and definitions, with particular emphasis on optimal development, refinement, and implementation of AI and ML in health equity research. To accompany the glossary, the EEWG developed a concept relationship diagram that describes the logical flow of and relationship between the definitional concepts. Lastly, the interview guide provides questions that can be used or adapted to garner stakeholder and community perspectives on the principles and glossary.
   Conclusions: Ongoing engagement is needed around our principles and glossary to identify and predict potential limitations in their uses in AI and ML research settings, especially for institutions with limited resources. This requires time, careful consideration, and honest discussions around what classifies an engagement incentive as meaningful to support and sustain their full engagement. By slowing down to meet historically and presently underresourced institutions and communities wherethey areand wherethey are capable of engaging and competing, there is higher potential to achieve needed diversity, ethics, and equity in AI and ML implementation in health research.

   DIAGNOSIS
AB Background: Cardiologs has developed the first electrocardiogram (ECG) algorithm that uses a deep neural network (DNN) for full 12-lead ECG analysis, including rhythm, QRS and ST-T-U waves. We compared the accuracy of the first version of Cardiologs (R) DNN algorithm to the Mortara/Veritas (R) conventional algorithm in emergency department (ED) ECG5.
   Methods: Individual ECG diagnoses were prospectively mapped to one of 16 pre-specified groups of ECG diagnoses, which were further classified as "major" ECG abnormality or not. Automated interpretations were compared to blinded experts'. The primary outcome was the performance of the algorithms in finding at least one "major" abnormality. The secondary outcome was the proportion of all ECGs for which all groups were identified, with no false negative or false positive groups ("accurate ECG interpretation"). Additionally, we measured sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) for any abnormal group.
   Results: Cardiologs (R) vs. Veritas (R) accuracy for finding a major abnormality was 92.2% vs. 87.2% (p < 0.0001), with comparable sensitivity (88.7% vs. 92.0%, p = 0.086), improved specificity (94.0% vs. 84.7%, p < 0.0001) and improved positive predictive value (PPV 88.2% vs. 75.4%, p < 0.0001). Cardiologs (R) had accurate ECG interpretation for 72.0% (95% CI: 69.6-74.2) of ECGs vs. 59.8% (57.3-62.3) for Veritas (R) (P< 0.0001). Sensitivity for any abnormal group for Cardiologs (R) and Veritas (R), respectively, was 69.6% (95CI 66.7-723) vs. 68.3% (95CI 65.3-71.1) (NS). Positive Predictive Value was 74.0% (71.1-76.7) for Cardiologs (R) vs. 56.5% (53.7-593) for Veritas (R) (P < 0.0001).
   Conclusion: Cardiologs' DNN was more accurate and specific in identifying ECG5 with at least one major abnormal group. It had a significantly higher rate of accurate ECG interpretation, with similar sensitivity and higher PPV. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB This is a follow-up sensitivity study on r-mode gravitational wave signals from newborn neutron stars illustrating the applicability of machine learning algorithms for the detection of long-lived gravitational wave transients. In this sensitivity study, we examine three machine learning algorithms (MLAs): artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and constrained subspace classifiers. The objective of this study is to compare the detection efficiencies that MLAs can achieve to the efficiency of the conventional (seedless clustering) detection algorithm discussed in an earlier paper. Comparisons are made using two distinct r-mode waveforms. For the training of the MLAs, we assumed that some information about the distance to the source is given so that the training was performed over distance ranges not wider than half an order of magnitude. The results of this study suggest that we can use the machine learning algorithms as part of an investigative stage in the pipeline that would be able to provide very fast and solid triggers for further, and more intense, investigation.

DT Article
AB Clinical prediction models based on artificial intelligence algorithms can potentially improve patient care, reduce errors, and add value to the health care system. However, their adoption is hindered by legitimate economic, practical, professional, and intellectual concerns. This article explores these barriers and highlights well-studied instruments that can be used to overcome them. Adopting actionable predictive models will require the purposeful incorporation of patient, clinical, technical, and administrative perspectives. Model developers must articulate a priori clinical needs, ensure explainability and low error frequency and severity, and promote safety and fairness. Models themselves require ongoing validation and monitoring to address variations in health care settings and must comply with an evolving regulatory environment. Through these principles, surgeons and health care providers can leverage artificial intelligence to optimize patient care. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID ENERGY SURFACES; REPRESENTATION; CHEMISTRY
AB This paper presents TorchANI, a PyTorch-based program for training/inference of ANI (ANAKIN-ME) deep learning models to obtain potential energy surfaces and other physical properties of molecular systems. ANI is an accurate neural network potential originally implemented using C++/CUDA in a program called NeuroChem. Compared with NeuroChem, TorchANI has a design emphasis on being lightweight, user friendly, cross platform, and easy to read and modify for fast prototyping, while allowing acceptable sacrifice on running performance. Because the computation of atomic environmental vectors and atomic neural networks are all implemented using PyTorch operators, TorchANI is able to use PyTorch's autograd engine to automatically compute analytical forces and Hessian matrices, as well as do force training without requiring any additional codes. TorchANI is open-source and freely available on GitHub: https://github.com/aiqm/torchani.

AB Objective. Recent efforts to update the definitions and taxonomic structure of concepts related to pain have revealed opportunities to better quantify topics of existing pain research subject areas. Methods. Here, we apply basic natural language processing (NLP) analyses on a corpus of >200,000 abstracts published on PubMed under the medical subject heading (MeSH) of "pain" to quantify the topics, content, and themes on pain-related research dating back to the 1940s. Results. The most common stemmed terms included "pain" (601,122 occurrences), "patient" (508,064 occurrences), and "studi-" (208,839 occurrences). Contrarily, terms with the highest term frequency-inverse document frequency included "tmd" (6.21), "qol" (6.01), and "endometriosis" (5.94). Using the vector-embedded model of term definitions available via the "word2vec" technique, the most similar terms to "pain" included "discomfort," "symptom," and "pain-related." For the term "acute," the most similar terms in the word2vec vector space included "nonspecific," "vaso-occlusive," and "subacute"; for the term "chronic," the most similar terms included "persistent," "longstanding," and "long-standing." Topic modeling via Latent Dirichlet analysis identified peak coherence (0.49) at 40 topics. Network analysis of these topic models identified three topics that were outliers from the core cluster, two of which pertained to women's health and obstetrics and were closely connected to one another, yet considered distant from the third outlier pertaining to age. A deep learning-based gated recurrent units abstract generation model successfully synthesized several unique abstracts with varying levels of believability, with special attention and some confusion at lower temperatures to the roles of placebo in randomized controlled trials. Conclusions. Quantitative NLP models of published abstracts pertaining to pain may point to trends and gaps within pain research communities.

AB Surface blemishes of various apple varieties were analyzed by their reflectance characteristics between 460 and 1130 nm. Normalized reflectance data were collected at 10 nm increments with liquid crystal tunable filters. Data were utilized as input values for various pattern recognition models specifically multi-layer back propagation, unimodal Gaussian, K-nearest neighbor and nearest cluster algorithms. Partitioning data into 50:50 training and test sets, correct classification in separating unflawed versus blemished areas ranged from 62 to 96% (Year I) and from 73 to 85% (Year II). The algorithm which yielded the highest correct classification was the multi-layer back propagation but minor variation was found for number of hidden nodes or neural net architecture.

AB Natural disturbances like hurricanes can cause extensive disorder in forest structure, composition, and succession. Consequently, ecological, social, and economic alterations may occur. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and deep learning have been used for estimating forest attributes with high accuracy, but to date, no study has combined both TLS and deep learning for assessing the impact of hurricane disturbance at the individual tree level. Here, we aim to assess the capability of TLS and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) combined for classifying post-Hurricane Michael damage severity at the individual tree level in a pine-dominated forest ecosystem in the Florida Panhandle, Southern U.S. We assessed the combined impact of using either binary-color or multicolored-by-height TLS-derived 2D images along with six CNN architectures (Densenet201, EfficientNet_b7, Inception_v3, Res-net152v2, VGG16, and a simple CNN). The confusion matrices used for assessing the overall accuracy were symmetric in all six CNNs and 2D image variants tested with overall accuracy ranging from 73% to 92%. We found higher F-1 scores when classifying trees with damage severity varying from extremely leaning, trunk snapped, stem breakage, and uprooted compared to trees that were undamaged or slightly leaning (<45 degrees). Moreover, we found higher accuracies when using VGG16 combined with multicolored-by-height TLS-derived 2D images compared with other methods. Our findings demonstrate the high capability of combining TLS with CNNs for classifying post-hurricane damage severity at the individual tree level in pine forest ecosystems. As part of this work, we developed a new open-source R package (rTLsDeep) and implemented all methods tested herein. We hope that the promising results and the rTLsDeep R package developed in this study for classifying post-hurricane damage severity at the individual tree level will stimulate further research and applications not just in pine forests but in other forest types in hurricane-prone regions.

ID PREDICTION
AB Estimation of yield performance for crop products is a topic of interest in agriculture. In breeding programs, we cannot test all possible hybrids created by crossing two parents (inbred and tester) since it would be too time consuming and costly. In this paper, we exploit different machine learning algorithms including decision tree, gradient boosting machine, random forest, adaptive boosting, XGBoost and neural network to predict the yield of corn hybrids using data provided in the 2020 Syngenta Crop Challenge. The participants were asked to predict the yield of missing hybrids which were not tested before. Our results show that the prediction obtained by XGBoost is more accurate than other models with a root mean square error equal to 0.0524. Therefore, we use XGBoost model to estimate the yield performance for untested combinations of inbreds and testers. Using this approach, we identify hybrids with high predicted yield that can be bred to increase corn production. & COPY; 2021 The Authors.

TI Communicating the use of artificial intelligence in agricultural and

SO AGRICULTURAL & ENVIRONMENTAL LETTERS

DT Editorial Material
AB Transformative technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) make difficult tasks more accessible and convenient. Since 2018, the use of AI in research has increased drastically, with annual publication rates of 3-5 times higher than pre-2017. Currently, >100,000 manuscripts using AI are published annually within science and engineering, and >20,000 of these belong to the agricultural and environmental fields. Given the magnitude of use, clear communication on how AI is used and how it helps advance scientific knowledge is essential. Clear communication is perhaps more necessary with AI than previous technologies due to its broad and flexible spectrum of uses, the "black-box" nature of deep-learning algorithms, and ongoing debates regarding AI's predictive power versus knowledge of first-principles mechanistic and process-based theories and models. In this commentary, we provide guidelines and discussion points to the scientific community to ensure transparent and effective communication of AI research in agricultural and environmental research publications.

AB A fundamental task in data science is the discovery, description, and identification of any symmetries present in the data. We developed a deep learning methodology for the simultaneous discovery of multiple non-trivial continuous symmetries across an entire labeled dataset. The symmetry transformations and the corresponding generators are modeled with fully connected neural networks trained with a specially constructed loss function, ensuring the desired symmetry properties. The two new elements in this work are the use of a reduced-dimensionality latent space and the generalization to invariant transformations with respect to high-dimensional oracles. The method is demonstrated with several examples on the MNIST digit dataset, where the oracle is provided by the 10-dimensional vector of logits of a trained classifier. We find classes of symmetries that transform each image from the dataset into new synthetic images while conserving the values of the logits. We illustrate these transformations as lines of equal probability ("flows") in the reduced latent space. These results show that symmetries in the data can be successfully searched for and identified as interpretable non-trivial transformations in the equivalent latent space.

AB A real-time Deep Neural Network (DNN) adaptive control architecture is developed for general uncertain nonlinear dynamical systems to track a desired time-varying trajectory. A Lyapunov-based method is leveraged to develop adaptation laws for the output-layer weights of a DNN model in real-time while a data-driven supervised learning algorithm is used to update the inner-layer weights of the DNN. Specifically, the output-layer weights of the DNN are estimated using an unsupervised learning algorithm to provide responsiveness and guaranteed tracking performance with real-time feedback. The inner-layer weights of the DNN are trained with collected data sets to increase performance, and the adaptation laws are updated once a sufficient amount of data is collected. Building on the results in (Joshi and Chowdhary, 2019) and (Joshi et al., 2020), which focus on deep model reference adaptive control for linear systems with known drift dynamics and control effectiveness matrices, this letter considers general control-affine uncertain nonlinear systems. The real-time controller and adaptation laws enable the system to track a desired time-varying trajectory while compensating for the unknown drift dynamics and parameter uncertainties in the control effectiveness. A nonsmooth Lyapunov-based analysis is used to prove semi-global asymptotic tracking of the desired trajectory. Numerical simulation examples are included to validate the results, and the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is used to train the weights of the DNN.

While the use of computerized formative assessments in the classroom allows teachers to assess students' learning continuously and more frequently, there are implementation-related barriers that prevent teachers from maximizing the diagnostic value of such assessments. For example, the administration frequency and scheduling of computerized formative assessments are highly critical for students regardless of their performance level. Traditionally, most teachers have to rely on their judgment and observations in determining the testing schedule for all students. Human judgments, however, might be highly subjective given that teachers are not likely to oversee each student's academic history closely. In this study, we aim to introduce a deep learning framework to predict and optimize the number of test administrations and support the decisions using clustering approaches. We used math performance data gathered from 10,107 first graders during the 2017-2018 school year. Our best model demonstrated highly accurate prediction results with average accuracy scores close to 90%. In addition, the clustering approach revealed interpretable insights into how the test administration decisions were associated with students' performance profiles. The proposed system would greatly help teachers make more systematic and informed test administration decisions and thereby maximize the effectiveness of computerized formative assessments in promoting student learning.

AB Background: Learning the causal structure helps identify risk factors, disease mechanisms, and candidate therapeutics for complex diseases. However, although complex biological systems are characterized by nonlinear associations, existing bioinformatic methods of causal inference cannot identify the nonlinear relationships and estimate their effect size. Results: To overcome these limitations, we developed the first computational method that explicitly learns nonlinear causal relations and estimates the effect size using a deep neural network approach coupled with the knockoff framework, named causal directed acyclic graphs using deep learning variable selection (DAG-deepVASE). Using simulation data of diverse scenarios and identifying known and novel causal relations in molecular and clinical data of various diseases, we demonstrated that DAG-deepVASE consistently outperforms existing methods in identifying true and known causal relations. In the analyses, we also illustrate how identifying nonlinear causal relations and estimating their effect size help understand the complex disease pathobiology, which is not possible using other methods. Conclusions: With these advantages, the application of DAG-deepVASE can help identify driver genes and therapeutic agents in biomedical studies and clinical trials.

AB This study presents a methodological framework for predicting soil organic carbon (SOC) using laboratory spectral recordings from a handheld near-infrared (NIR, 1350-2550 nm) device combined with open geospatial data derived from remote sensing sensors related to landform, climate, and vegetation. Initial experiments proved the superiority of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using only spectral data captured by the low-cost spectral devices reaching an R2 of 0.62, RMSE of 0.31 log-SOC, and an RPIQ of 1.87. Furthermore, the incorporation of geo-covariates with Neo-Spectra data substantially enhanced predictive capabilities, outperforming existing approaches. Although the CNN-derived spectral features had the greatest contribution to the model, the geo-covariates that were most informative to the model were primarily the rainfall data, the valley bottom flatness, and the snow probability. The results demonstrate that hybrid modeling approaches, particularly using CNNs to preprocess all features and fit prediction models with Extreme Gradient Boosting trees, CNN-XGBoost, significantly outperformed traditional machine learning methods, with a notable RMSE reduction, reaching an R2 of 0.72, and an RPIQ of 2.17. The findings of this study highlight the effectiveness of multimodal data integration and hybrid models in enhancing predictive accuracy for SOC assessments. Finally, the application of interpretable techniques elucidated the contributions of various climatic and topographical factors to predictions, as well as spectral information, underscoring the complex interactions affecting SOC variability.

AB Functional connectivity (FC) obtained from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging has been integrated with machine learning algorithms to deliver consistent and reliable brain disease classification outcomes. However, in classical learning procedures, custom-built specialized feature selection techniques are typically used to filter out uninformative features from FC patterns to generalize efficiently on the datasets. The ability of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and other deep learning models to extract informative features from data with grid structure (such as images) has led to the surge in popularity of these techniques. However, the designs of many existing CNN models still fail to exploit the relationships between entities of graph-structure data (such as networks). Therefore, graph convolution network (GCN) has been suggested as a means for uncovering the intricate structure of brain network data, which has the potential to substantially improve classification accuracy. Furthermore, overfitting in classifiers can be largely attributed to the limited number of available training samples. Recently, the generative adversarial network (GAN) has been widely used in the medical field for its generative aspect that can generate synthesis images to cope with the problems of data scarcity and patient privacy. In our previous work, GCN and GAN have been designed to investigate FC patterns to perform diagnosis tasks, and their effectiveness has been tested on the ABIDE-I dataset. In this paper, the models will be further applied to FC data derived from more public datasets (ADHD, ABIDE-II, and ADNI) and our in-house dataset (PTSD) to justify their generalization on all types of data. The results of a number of experiments show the powerful characteristic of GAN to mimic FC data to achieve high performance in disease prediction. When employing GAN for data augmentation, the diagnostic accuracy across ADHD-200, ABIDE-II, and ADNI datasets surpasses that of other machine learning models, including results achieved with BrainNetCNN. Specifically, in ADHD, the accuracy increased from 67.74% to 73.96% with GAN, in ABIDE-II from 70.36% to 77.40%, and in ADNI, reaching 52.84% and 88.56% for multiclass and binary classification, respectively. GCN also obtains decent results, with the best accuracy in ADHD datasets at 71.38% for multinomial and 75% for binary classification, respectively, and the second-best accuracy in the ABIDE-II dataset (72.28% and 75.16%, respectively). Both GAN and GCN achieved the highest accuracy for the PTSD dataset, reaching 97.76%. However, there are still some limitations that can be improved. Both methods have many opportunities for the prediction and diagnosis of diseases.

AB Typically, developing new digital agriculture technologies requires substantial on-site resources and data. However, the crop's growth cycle provides only limited time windows for experiments and equipment validation. This study presents a photorealistic digital twin of a commercial-scale strawberry farm, coupled with a simulated ground vehicle, to address these constraints by generating high-fidelity synthetic RGB and LiDAR data. These data enable the rapid development and evaluation of a deep learning-based machine vision pipeline for fruit detection and sizing without continuously relying on real-field access. Traditional simulators often lack visual realism, leading many studies to mix real images or adopt domain adaptation methods to address the reality gap. In contrast, this work relies solely on photorealistic simulation outputs for training, eliminating the need for real images or specialized adaptation approaches. After training exclusively on images captured in the virtual environment, the model was tested on a commercial-scale strawberry farm using a physical ground vehicle. Two separate trials with field images resulted in F1-scores of 0.92 and 0.81 for detection and a sizing error of 1.4 mm (R2 = 0.92) when comparing image-derived diameters against caliper measurements. These findings indicate that a digital twin-driven sim2real transfer can offer substantial time and cost savings by refining crucial tasks such as stereo sensor calibration and machine learning model development before extensive real-field deployments. In addition, the study examined geometric accuracy and visual fidelity through systematic comparisons of LiDAR and RGB sensor outputs from the virtual and real farms. Results demonstrated close alignment in both topography and textural details, validating the digital twin's ability to replicate intricate field characteristics, including raised bed geometry and strawberry plant distribution. The techniques developed and validated in this strawberry project have broad applicability across agricultural commodities, particularly for fruit and vegetable production systems. This study demonstrates that integrating digital twins with simulation tools can significantly reduce the need for resource-intensive field data collection while accelerating the development and refinement of agricultural robotics algorithms and hardware.

AB The HIV-1 genome is highly heterogeneous. This variation affords the virus a wide range of molecular properties, including the ability to infect cell types, such as macrophages and lymphocytes, expressing different chemokine receptors on the cell surface. In particular, R5 HIV-1 viruses use CCR5 as a coreceptor for viral entry, X4 viruses use CXCR4, whereas some viral strains, known as R5X4 or D-tropic, have the ability to utilize both coreceptors. X4 and R5X4 viruses are associated with rapid disease progression to AIDS. R5X4 viruses differ in that they have yet to be characterized by the examination of the genetic sequence of HIV-1 alone. In this study, a series of experiments was performed to evaluate different strategies of feature selection and neural network optimization. We demonstrate the use of artificial neural networks trained via evolutionary computation to predict viral coreceptor usage. The results indicate the identification of R5X4 viruses with a predictive accuracy of 75.5 percent.

AB Sandy soils are susceptible to excessive nitrogen (N) leaching under intensive crop production which is linked with the soil's low nutrient holding capacity and high-water infiltration rate. Estimating soil mineral nitrogen (SMN) at the daily time-step is crucial in providing fertilizer recommendations balancing plant nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and N losses to the environment. Crop models [e.g., Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT)] can simulate SMN trend under varied fertilizer application rates and timings but struggle with accuracy in high-water table conditioned sub-irrigated soil. Alternatively, time-series deep learning (DL) models based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) are promising in understanding nonlinearity among complex variables. Yet, purely data-driven DL models for crops are challenging to develop due to limited field data availability and the excessive costs to collect more field data. Hence, a hybrid model (hybrid-LSTM) was developed by leveraging both the DSSAT and LSTM models to estimate daily SMN primarily using daily weather, applied fertilizer rates-timings, and the SMN sparse observations. This study used the observations from field trials conducted between 2011-2014 in Hastings, FL. The first step was to calibrate the DSSAT-SUBSTOR-Potato model to produce reliable SMN of the topsoil for treatments with varied N applied fertilizer rates split among the pre-planting, emergence, and tuber-initiation stages of the potato. Thereafter, the hybrid-LSTM model was trained on the calibrated DSSAT simulated SMN time-series and fine-tuned its predictions using the observed SMN to improve DSSAT simulated SMN. The hybrid-LSTM model was then tested on both calibrated and uncalibrated DSSAT SMN simulations where it outperformed the DSSAT model (improvement ranged similar to 18-30 % on comparing the normalized root mean squared error) in providing reliable estimates of SMN across most of the farms and years. This novel hybrid modeling approach could guide stakeholders and farmers to build sustainable N management with improved crop NUE and yield and help in minimizing environmental losses.

AB Purpose This study aims to examine consumers' perception of artificial intelligence (AI) and AI marketing communication. Design/methodology/approach Twenty in-depth interviews were conducted to collect data and phenomenological reduction was used to analyze data. Findings Findings suggest that consumers' interpretation of AI is multidimensional and relational with a focus on functionality and emotion, as well as comparison and contrast between AI and human beings; consumers' perception of voice-assisted AI centers on the aspects of function, communication, adaptation, relationship and privacy; consumers consider AI marketing communication to be unavoidable and generally acceptable; and consumers believe that AI marketing communication to be limited in its effect on influencing their evaluation of products/brands or shaping their consumptive behaviors. Originality/value According to the authors' knowledge, this study is the first research project to gauge consumers' perception on AI and AI marketing communication.

AB Society's future depends on informed perspectives of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and AI related skills, a prognosis that greatly impacts K-12 education. To best prepare students to be AI savvy, there is a need to integrate AI tools, skills, and lessons into the K-12 curriculum. In order for teachers to develop the knowledge and skills, and have the self-efficacy for using AI in instruction, they must be well prepared and informed of what AI is (and what it is not) and its potential role in K-12 education. This study explored teachers' (mis)conceptions relative to their intentional and informal learning. Our research provides important implications for teacher preparation and in-service professional development regarding AI in our society and implementation of AI tools and processes in K-12 education.

AB Deep neural networks provide remarkable performances on supervised learning tasks with extensive collections of labeled data. However, creating such large well-annotated data sets requires a considerable amount of resources, time and effort, especially for underwater images data sets such as corals and marine animals. Therefore, the overreliance on labels is one of the main obstacles for widespread applications of deep learning methods. In order to overcome this need for large annotated dataset, this paper proposes a label-efficient deep learning framework for image segmentation using only very sparse point-supervision. Our approach employs a latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) with spatial coherence on feature space to iteratively generate pseudo labels. The method requires, as an initial condition, a Wide Residual Network (WRN) trained with sparse labels and mutual information constraints. The proposed method is evaluated on the sparsely labeled coral image data set collected from the Pulley Ridge region in the Gulf of Mexico. Experiments show that our method can improve image segmentation performance against sparsely labeled samples and achieves better results compared with other semi-supervised approaches.

AB Tidal creeks play a vital role in influencing geospatial evolution and marsh ecological communities in coastal landscapes. However, evaluating the geospatial characteristics of numerous creeks across a site and understanding their ecological relationships pose significant challenges due to the labor-intensive nature of manual delineation from imagery. Traditional methods rely on manual annotation in GIS interfaces, which is slow and tedious. This study explores the application of Attention-based Dense U-Net (ADU-Net), a deep learning image segmentation model, for automatically classifying creek pixels in high-resolution (0.5 m) orthorectified aerial imagery in coastal Georgia, USA. We observed that ADU-Net achieved an outstanding F1 score of 0.98 in identifying creek pixels, demonstrating its ability in tidal creek mapping. The study highlights the potential of deep learning models for automated tidal creek mapping, opening avenues for future investigations into the role of creeks in marshes' response to environmental changes.

AB Models based on vision transformer architectures are considered state-of-the-art when it comes to image classification tasks. However, they require extensive computational resources both for training and deployment. The problem is exacerbated as the amount and complexity of the data increases. Quantum-based vision transformer models could potentially alleviate this issue by reducing the training and operating time while maintaining the same predictive power. Although current quantum computers are not yet able to perform high-dimensional tasks, they do offer one of the most efficient solutions for the future. In this work, we construct several variations of a quantum hybrid vision transformer for a classification problem in high-energy physics (distinguishing photons and electrons in the electromagnetic calorimeter). We test them against classical vision transformer architectures. Our findings indicate that the hybrid models can achieve comparable performance to their classical analogs with a similar number of parameters.

AB Representations in the brain are encoded as patterns of activity of large populations of neurons. The science of population encoded representations, also known as parallel distributed processing (PDP), achieves neurological verisimilitude and has been able to account for a large number of cognitive phenomena in normal people, including reaction times (and reading latencies), stimulus recognition, the effect of stimulus salience on attention, perceptual invariance, simultaneous egocentric and allocentric visual processing, top-down/bottom-up processing, language errors, the effect of statistical regularities of experience, frequency, and age of acquisition, instantiation of rules and symbols, content addressable memory and the capacity for pattern completion, preservation of function in the face of noisy or distorted input, inference, parallel constraint satisfaction, the binding problem and gamma coherence, principles of hippocampal function, the location of knowledge in the brain, limitations in the scope and depth of knowledge acquired through experience, and Piagetian stages of cognitive development. PDP studies have been able to provide a coherent account for impairment in a variety of language functions resulting from stroke or dementia in a large number of languages and the phenomenon of graceful degradation observed in such studies. They have also made important contributions to our understanding of attention (including hemispatial neglect), emotional function, executive function, motor planning, visual processing, decision making, and neuroeconomics. The relationship of neural network population dynamics to electroencephalographic rhythms is starting to emerge. Nevertheless, PDP approaches have scarcely penetrated major areas of study of cognition, including neuropsychology and cognitive neuropsychology, as well as much of cognitive psychology. This article attempts to provide an overview of PDP principles and applications that addresses a broader audience.

AB This brief paper provides an approximate online adaptive solution to the infinite-horizon optimal tracking problem for control-affine continuous-time nonlinear systems with unknown drift dynamics. To relax the persistence of excitation condition, model-based reinforcement learning is implemented using a concurrent-learning-based system identifier to simulate experience by evaluating the Bellman error over unexplored areas of the state space. Tracking of the desired trajectory and convergence of the developed policy to a neighborhood of the optimal policy are established via Lyapunov-based stability analysis. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed technique.

AB The worldwide prevalence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is increasing, causing a significant medical burden, but no approved therapeutics are currently available. NASH drug development requires histological analysis of liver biopsies by expert pathologists for trial enrolment and efficacy assessment, which can be hindered by multiple issues including sample heterogeneity, inter-reader and intra-reader variability, and ordinal scoring systems. Consequently, there is a high unmet need for accurate, reproducible, quantitative, and automated methods to assist pathologists with histological analysis to improve the precision around treatment and efficacy assessment. Digital pathology (DP) workflows in combination with artificial intelligence (AI) have been established in other areas of medicine and are being actively investigated in NASH to assist pathologists in the evaluation and scoring of NASH histology. DP/AI models can be used to automatically detect, localise, quantify, and score histological parameters and have the potential to reduce the impact of scoring variability in NASH clinical trials. This narrative review provides an overview of DP/AI tools in development for NASH, highlights key regulatory considerations, and discusses how these advances may impact the future of NASH clinical management and drug development. This should be a high priority in the NASH field, particularly to improve the development of safe and effective therapeutics. (c) 2023 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

AB Surgeons perform two primary tasks: operating and engaging patients and caregivers in shared decision-making. Human dexterity and decision-making are biologically limited. Intelligent, autonomous machines have the potential to augment or replace surgeons. Rather than regarding this possibility with denial, ire, or indifference, surgeons should understand and steer these technologies. Closer examination of surgical innovations and lessons learned from the automotive industry can inform this process. Innovations in minimally invasive surgery and surgical decision-making follow classic S-shaped curves with three phases: (1) introduction of a new technology, (2) achievement of a performance advantage relative to existing standards, and (3) arrival at a performance plateau, followed by replacement with an innovation featuring greater machine autonomy and less human influence. There is currently no level I evidence demonstrating improved patient outcomes using intelligent, autonomous machines for performing operations or surgical decision-making tasks. History suggests that if such evidence emerges and if the machines are cost effective, then they will augment or replace humans, initially for simple, common, rote tasks under close human supervision and later for complex tasks with minimal human supervision. This process poses ethical challenges in assigning liability for errors, matching decisions to patient values, and displacing human workers, but may allow surgeons to spend less time gathering and analyzing data and more time interacting with patients and tending to urgent, critical-and potentially more valuable-aspects of patient care. Surgeons should steer these technologies toward optimal patient care and net social benefit using the uniquely human traits of creativity, altruism, and moral deliberation. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB Background and Aims We aimed to develop and validate machine learning algorithms to predict direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment failure among patients with HCV infection. Approach and Results We used HCV-TARGET registry data to identify HCV-infected adults receiving all-oral DAA treatment and having virologic outcome. Potential pretreatment predictors (n = 179) included sociodemographic, clinical characteristics, and virologic data. We applied multivariable logistic regression as well as elastic net, random forest, gradient boosting machine (GBM), and feedforward neural network machine learning algorithms to predict DAA treatment failure. Training (n = 4894) and validation (n = 1631) patient samples had similar sociodemographic and clinical characteristics (mean age, 57 years; 60% male; 66% White; 36% with cirrhosis). Of 6525 HCV-infected adults, 95.3% achieved sustained virologic response, whereas 4.7% experienced DAA treatment failure. In the validation sample, machine learning approaches performed similarly in predicting DAA treatment failure (C statistic [95% CI]: GBM, 0.69 [0.64-0.74]; random forest, 0.68 [0.63-0.73]; feedforward neural network, 0.66 [0.60-0.71]; elastic net, 0.64 [0.59-0.70]), and all four outperformed multivariable logistic regression (0.51 [0.46-0.57]). Using the Youden index to identify the balanced risk score threshold, GBM had 66.2% sensitivity and 65.1% specificity, and 12 individuals were needed to evaluate to identify 1 DAA treatment failure. Over 55% of patients with treatment failure were classified by the GBM in the top three risk decile subgroups (positive predictive value: 6%-14%). The top 10 GBM-identified predictors included albumin, liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase), total bilirubin levels, sex, HCV viral loads, sodium level, HCC, platelet levels, and tobacco use. Conclusions Machine learning algorithms performed effectively for risk prediction and stratification of DAA treatment failure.

AB In this review, we outline the current trends in the field of machine learning-driven classification studies related to ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion) and toxicity endpoints from the past six years (2015-2021). The study focuses only on classification models with large datasets (i.e. more than a thousand compounds). A comprehensive literature search and meta-analysis was carried out for nine different targets: hERG-mediated cardiotoxicity, blood-brain barrier penetration, permeability glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate/inhibitor, cytochrome P450 enzyme family, acute oral toxicity, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, respiratory toxicity and irritation/corrosion. The comparison of the best classification models was targeted to reveal the differences between machine learning algorithms and modeling types, endpoint-specific performances, dataset sizes and the different validation protocols. Based on the evaluation of the data, we can say that tree-based algorithms are (still) dominating the field, with consensus modeling being an increasing trend in drug safety predictions. Although one can already find classification models with great performances to hERG-mediated cardiotoxicity and the isoenzymes of the cytochrome P450 enzyme family, these targets are still central to ADMET-related research efforts.

AB Reliable soil moisture (SM) data is critical for effective water resources management, yet its accurate measurement and prediction remain challenging. This study was conducted to develop a deep learning regression network for sub-hourly SM prediction and compare its performance with traditional machine learning models, including the eXtreme gradient boosting (XGB), light gradient-boosting (LGB), cat boosting (CB), random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) models. Sub-hourly SM, electrical conductivity (EC), soil temperature (ST), and weather parameters were collected during research experiments conducted for two years (2020-2021 and 2021-2022) at the Tropical Research and Education Center (TREC), University of Florida. A network of SM sensors and a weather station were installed at the experimental site with 24 plots of green beans and sweet corn under full and three deficit irrigation treatments with three replications. Model performance metrics such as coefficient of determination (r2) and global performance indicator (GPI) were used to evaluate the performance of the models. Results showed that all MLs and DL models performed more than satisfactorily in simulating SM of green beans and sweet corn plots. The testing average r2 and GPI of MLs were 0.83 and 0.02 (green beans) and 0.85 and 0.02 (sweet corn). However, XGB and LGB models outperformed the remaining ML and DL models. The testing r2 and GPI of XGB were 0.86 and 0.014 for green beans, whereas 0.88 and 0.015 for sweet corn. The r2 and GPI values for the LGB were 0.85 and 0.014 for green beans, while 0.88 and 0.015 for sweet corn. Even though DL model took longer and resources to be trained, its performance was not as accurate as that of XGB and LGB models. However, the performance of DL was better than the LSTM model. The r2 and RMSE of the LSTM model were 0.68 and 0.02cm 3 cm-3 for green beans and 0.75 and 0.02cm 3 cm-3 for sweet corn, respectively. Whereas the r2 and RMSE of DL were 0.84 and 0.015cm 3 cm-3 (green beans) and 0.85 and 0.02 cm 3 cm-3 (sweet corn). The ML and DL models performed better in simulating SM of sweet corn plots than green beans. Overall, these results confirmed that the ML and DL models could be alternative tools for SM prediction for agricultural fields, with potential applications for irrigation scheduling and water resources management.

AB The high dimensionality of data generated by Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV)-Lidar makes it difficult to use classical statistical techniques to design accurate predictive models from these data for conducting forest inventories. Machine learning techniques have the potential to solve this problem of modeling forest attributes from remotely sensed data. This work tests four different machine learning approaches namely Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Networks, and Extreme Gradient Boosting on high-density GatorEye UAV-Lidar point clouds for indirect estimation of individual tree dendrometric metrics (field derived) such as diameter at breast height, total height, and timber volume. A total of 370 trees had their dbh and height measured for validation purposes. Using LAStools we generated normalized Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) point clouds and created a raster canopy height model at a 0.5 x 0.5 m spatial resolution following the construction of a digital terrain model and a digital surface model. The R package 'lidR' was set with the functions tree_detection (local maximum filter algorithm) and lastrees. Subsequently, we applied the function tree_metrics to extract individual metrics. Machine learning techniques were applied to the derived metrics to estimate dendrometric field measures. The machine learning models (MLM) with optimal hyperparameters showed similar predictive performances for modeling the variables diameter, height, and volume. All models had a rRMSE below 15% (for diameter at breast height), 9% (for height) and 29% (for volume). The Support Vector Regression algorithm showed the best performance. Our work demonstrates that all tested machine learning models are adequate and robust to handle the high dimensionality of UAV-Lidar data for the estimation of individual attributes, with Support Vector Regression model being the best performer in terms of minimal error rates.

AB Navigating unmanned aerial vehicles in precarious environments is of great importance. It is necessary to rely on alternative information processing techniques to attain spatial information that is required for navigation in such settings. This paper introduces a novel deep learning-based approach for navigating that exclusively relies on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The proposed method utilizes deep neural networks (DNNs) for image matching, retrieval, and registration. To this end, we introduce Deep Cosine Similarity Neural Networks (DCSNNs) for mapping SAR images to a global descriptive feature vector. We also introduce a fine-tuning algorithm for DC-SNNs, and DCSNNs are used to generate a database of feature vectors for SAR images that span a geographic area of interest, which, in turn, are compared against a feature vector of an inquiry image. Images similar to the inquiry are retrieved from the database by using a scalable distance measure between the feature vector outputs of DCSNN. Methods for reranking the retrieved SAR images that are used to update position coordinates of an inquiry SAR image by estimating from the best retrieved SAR image are also introduced. Numerical experiments comparing with baselines on the Polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) images are presented.

AB To meet the expected demand for food while protecting animal welfare, environmental sustainability, and profitability, animal production efficiency must improve. Improvements in grazinglands management techniques can impact livestock production efficiency. The current stage of artificial intelligence development, mainly machine learning techniques, remote sensing (RS), and precision agriculture technologies, automatizes data collection and raises the monitoring capacity to support on-farm decision-making. This literature review presents current developments in precision livestock farming (PLF) applied to grazinglands monitoring and management, demonstrates some knowledge gaps, and discusses potential solutions of grazinglands management issues. Although the implementation of precision technologies in grazing systems is advancing rapidly, challenges, such as lack of reliable reference data and low variability of datasets used to calibrate models, are examples of constraints to be addressed in future studies. More effort in terms of relationship strengthening between farmers and researchers, benefits elucidation, cooperation among professionals with different expertise, and software or app development must be directed to make the knowledge accessible and largely implemented in field conditions.

AB The surge in internet use to express personal thoughts and beliefs makes it increasingly feasible for the social NLP research community to find and validate associations between social media posts and mental health status. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of social media data bring to fore the importance of real-time responsible AI models for mental health analysis. Aiming to classify the research directions for social computing and tracking advances in the development of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) based models, we propose a comprehensive survey on quantifying mental health on social media. We compose a taxonomy for mental healthcare and highlight recent attempts in examining social well-being with personal writings on social media. We define all the possible research directions for mental healthcare and investigate a thread of handling online social media data for stress, depression and suicide detection for this work. The key features of this manuscript are (i) feature extraction and classification, (ii) recent advancements in AI models, (iii) publicly available dataset, (iv) new frontiers and future research directions. We compile this information to introduce young research and academic practitioners with the field of computational intelligence for mental health analysis on social media. In this manuscript, we carry out a quantitative synthesis and a qualitative review with the corpus of over 92 potential research articles. In this context, we release the collection of existing work on suicide detection in an easily accessible and updatable repository.

AB Florida is the largest fresh tomato producer in the USA. Due to the subtropical climate, especially the hot and humid weather, the devastating tomato bacterial spot disease (TBS), caused by the bacteria Xanthomonas perforans, has been a threat to tomato crops for decades. Prevention through early disease detection is a crucial management strategy to minimise losses. Diagnostics for this disease that are commonly used are a visual diagnosis of disease symptoms or laboratory assays. These procedures are time-consuming, require specialised personnel, and are inefficient in detecting the disease in its early stages. Hyperspectral imaging provides a non-invasive tool for early disease detection in various crops. In this study, five optimised machine learning algorithms (MLAs), such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLSDA), Weighted K-Nearest Neighbours (W-KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Ensemble Boosting Tree (EBT), were utilised for early detection of TBS in transplant houses. Two normalisation procedures, a standardisation method, and unit vectorisation, were applied to preprocess the data in a dynamic range expansion process. The input variables to the models included time-lined events of disease progression and reduced datasets. To create the reduced datasets, a novel data reduction methodology was developed, which was able to identify 12 key (significant) wavelengths (from the 300 initial scans of the hyperspectral camera) that carry the highest weighted spectral components for accurately detecting TBS-affected plants. The PLSDA model presented the highest F1 score (90%) on early detection of TBS. (c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IAgrE.

AB Background Nucleus is a fundamental task in microscopy image analysis and supports many other quantitative studies such as object counting, segmentation, tracking, etc. Deep neural networks are emerging as a powerful tool for biomedical image computing; in particular, convolutional neural networks have been widely applied to nucleus/cell detection in microscopy images. However, almost all models are tailored for specific datasets and their applicability to other microscopy image data remains unknown. Some existing studies casually learn and evaluate deep neural networks on multiple microscopy datasets, but there are still several critical, open questions to be addressed. Results We analyze the applicability of deep models specifically for nucleus detection across a wide variety of microscopy image data. More specifically, we present a fully convolutional network-based regression model and extensively evaluate it on large-scale digital pathology and microscopy image datasets, which consist of 23 organs (or cancer diseases) and come from multiple institutions. We demonstrate that for a specific target dataset, training with images from the same types of organs might be usually necessary for nucleus detection. Although the images can be visually similar due to the same staining technique and imaging protocol, deep models learned with images from different organs might not deliver desirable results and would require model fine-tuning to be on a par with those trained with target data. We also observe that training with a mixture of target and other/non-target data does not always mean a higher accuracy of nucleus detection, and it might require proper data manipulation during model training to achieve good performance. Conclusions We conduct a systematic case study on deep models for nucleus detection in a wide variety of microscopy images, aiming to address several important but previously understudied questions. We present and extensively evaluate an end-to-end, pixel-to-pixel fully convolutional regression network and report a few significant findings, some of which might have not been reported in previous studies. The model performance analysis and observations would be helpful to nucleus detection in microscopy images.

AB The information of network-wide future traffic speed distribution and its propagation is beneficial to develop proactive traffic congestion management strategies. However, predicting network-wide traffic speed propagation is non-trivial. This study develops a traffic flow dependency and dynamics based deep learning aided approach (TD2-DL), which predict network-wide high resolution traffic speed propagation by explicitly integrating temporal-spatial flow dependency, traffic flow dynamics with deep learning method techniques. Specifically, we first develop a graph theory-based method to identify the local temporal-spatial traffic dependency of each road among neighboring roads adaptive to the prediction horizon and traffic delay. Then, traffic speed propagation on every road is mathematically described by v-CTM based on traffic initial and boundary conditions. Next, the long short-term memory (LSTM) model is employed to predict boundary conditions factoring the traffic temporal-spatial dependency and historical data predicted by v-CTM. In this way, we well couple the physical models (traffic dependency and v-CTM) with the deep learning approach, and further make them coevolution under this framework. Last, an EKF is used to assimilate predicted traffic speed predicted by v-CTM coupled with the LSTMs and the field traffic data; an FNN is introduced to impute missing and corrupted data for improving the traffic speed prediction accuracy. The numerical experiments indicated that the TD2-DL predicted the network-wide traffic speed propagation in 30 minutes with accuracy varying from 85%-98%. It outperformed the tested models recently developed in literature. The ablation experimental results confirmed the significance of factoring traffic dependency and integrating data imputation and assimilation techniques for improving the prediction accuracy.

AB We present a novel method for detecting red tide (Karenia brevis) blooms off the west coast of Florida, driven by a neural network classifier that combines remote sensing data with spatiotemporally distributed in situ sample data. The network detects blooms over a 1-km grid, using seven ocean color features from the MODIS-Aqua satellite platform (2002-2021) and in situ sample data collected by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and its partners. Model performance was demonstrably enhanced by two key innovations: depth normalization of satellite features and encoding of an in situ feature. The satellite features were normalized to adjust for depth-dependent bottom reflection effects in shallow coastal waters. The in situ data were used to engineer a feature that contextualizes recent nearby ground truth of K. brevis concentrations through a K-nearest neighbor spatiotemporal proximity weighting scheme. A rigorous experimental comparison revealed that our model outperforms existing remote detection methods presented in the literature and applied in practice. This classifier has strong potential to be operationalized to support more efficient monitoring and mitigation of future blooms, more accurate communication about their spatial extent and distribution, and a deeper scientific understanding of bloom dynamics, transport, drivers, and impacts in the region. This approach also has the potential to be adapted for the detection of other algal blooms in coastal waters. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2024;00:1-15. (c) 2024 SETAC

AB Reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is one of the most important factors in the hydrologic cycle and water balance studies. In this study, the performance of three simple and three wavelet hybrid models were compared to estimate ETo in three different climates in Iran, based on different combinations of input variables. It was found that the wavelet-artificial neural network was the best model, and multiple linear regression (MLR) was the worst model in most cases, although the performance of the models was related to the climate and the input variables used for modeling. Overall, it was found that all models had good accuracy in terms of estimating daily ETo. Also, it was found in this study that large numbers of decomposition levels via the wavelet transform had noticeable negative effects on the performance of the wavelet-based models, especially for the wavelet-adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system and wavelet-MLR, but in contrast, the type of db wavelet function did not have a detectable effect on the performance of the wavelet-based models.

AB This core component of the Diabetes RElated to Acute pancreatitis and its Mechanisms (DREAM) study will examine the hypothesis that advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques can reflect underlying pathophysiologic changes and provide imaging biomarkers that predict diabetes mellitus (DM) after acute pancreatitis (AP). A subset of participants in the DREAM study will enroll and undergo serial MRI examinations using a specific research protocol. The aim of the study is to differentiate at-risk individuals from those who remain euglycemic by identifying parenchymal features after AP. Performing longitudinal MRI will enable us to observe and understand the natural history of post-AP DM. We will compare MRI parameters obtained by interrogating tissue properties in euglycemic, prediabetic, and incident diabetes subjects and correlate them with metabolic, genetic, and immunological phenotypes. Differentiating imaging parameters will be combined to develop a quantitative composite risk score. This composite risk score will potentially have the ability to monitor the risk of DM in clinical practice or trials. We will use artificial intelligence, specifically deep learning, algorithms to optimize the predictive ability of MRI. In addition to the research MRI, the DREAM study will also correlate clinical computed tomography and MRI scans with DM development.

AB Interest in the potential applications of artificial intelligence in medicine, anesthesiology, and the world at large has never been higher. The Anesthesia Research Council steering committee formed an anesthesiologist artificial intelligence expert workgroup charged with evaluating the current state of artificial intelligence in anesthesiology, providing examples of future artificial intelligence applications and identifying barriers to artificial intelligence progress. The workgroup's findings are summarized here, starting with a brief introduction to artificial intelligence for clinicians, followed by overviews of current and anticipated artificial intelligence-focused research and applications in anesthesiology. Anesthesiology's progress in artificial intelligence is compared to that of other medical specialties, and barriers to artificial intelligence development and implementation in our specialty are discussed. The workgroup's recommendations address stakeholders in policymaking, research, development, implementation, training, and use of artificial intelligence-based tools for perioperative care.

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING
LA English
DT Article
DE Deep neural networks; loss-based attention; patch mining; weighted sum
AB Although deep neural networks have achieved great success on numerous large-scale tasks, poor interpretability is still a notorious obstacle for practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel and general attention mechanism, loss-based attention, upon which we modify deep neural networks to mine significant image patches for explaining which parts determine the image decision-making. This is inspired by the fact that some patches contain significant objects or their parts for image-level decision. Unlike previous attention mechanisms that adopt different layers and parameters to learn weights and image prediction, the proposed loss-based attention mechanism mines significant patches by utilizing the same parameters to learn patch weights and logits (class vectors), and image prediction simultaneously, so as to connect the attention mechanism with the loss function for boosting the patch precision and recall. Additionally, different from previous popular networks that utilize max-pooling or stride operations in convolutional layers without considering the spatial relationship of features, the modified deep architectures first remove them to preserve the spatial relationship of image patches and greatly reduce their dependencies, and then add two convolutional or capsule layers to extract their features. With the learned patch weights, the image-level decision of the modified deep architectures is the weighted sum on patches. Extensive experiments on large-scale benchmark databases demonstrate that the proposed architectures can obtain better or competitive performance to state-of-the-art baseline networks with better interpretability. The source codes are available on: https://github.com/xsshi2015/Loss-based-Attention-for-Interpreting-Image-level-Prediction-of-Convolutional-Neural-Networks.

In this paper, we introduce a residual back projection technique (RBP) that improves the performance of deep image prior framework in iterative CT reconstruction, especially when the reconstruction problem is highly ill-posed. The RBP-DIP framework uses an untrained U-net in conjunction with a novel residual back projection connection to minimize the objective function while improving reconstruction accuracy. In each iteration, the weights of the untrained U-net are optimized, and the output of the U-net in the current iteration is used to update the input of the U-net in the next iteration through the proposed RBP connection. The introduction of the RBP connection strengthens the regularization effects of the DIP framework in the context of iterative CT reconstruction leading to improvements in accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that the RBP-DIP framework offers improvements over other state-of-the-art conventional IR methods, as well as pre-trained and untrained models with similar network structures under multiple conditions. These improvements are particularly significant in the few- view and limited-angle CT reconstructions, where the corresponding inverse problems are highly ill-posed and the training data is limited. Furthermore, RBP-DIP has the potential for further improvement. Most existing IR algorithms, pre-trained models, and enhancements applicable to the original DIP algorithm can also be integrated into the RBP-DIP framework.

AB To develop effective wildfire evacuation plans, it is crucial to study evacuation decision-making and identify the factors affecting individuals' choices. Statistic models (e.g., logistic regression) are widely used in the literature to predict household evacuation decisions, while the potential of machine learning models has not been fully explored. This study compared seven machine learning models with logistic regression to identify which approach is better for predicting a householder's decision to evacuate. The machine learning models tested include the naive Bayes classifier, K-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, neural network, classification and regression tree (CART), random forest, and extreme gradient boosting. These models were calibrated using the survey data collected from the 2019 Kincade Fire. The predictive performance of the machine learning models and the logistic regression was compared using F1 score, accuracy, precision, and recall. The results indicate that all the machine learning models performed better than the logistic regression. The CART model has the highest F1 score among all models, with a statistically significant difference from the logistic regression model. This CART model shows that the most important factor affecting the decision to evacuate is pre-fire safety perception. Other important factors include receiving an evacuation order, household risk perception (during the event), and education level.

TI Deep5hmC: predicting genome-wide 5-hydroxymethylcytosine landscape via a
   multimodal deep learning model

ID CELL-FREE DNA; METHYLATION; SIGNATURES; VARIANTS
AB Motivation 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), a crucial epigenetic mark with a significant role in regulating tissue-specific gene expression, is essential for understanding the dynamic functions of the human genome. Despite its importance, predicting 5hmC modification across the genome remains a challenging task, especially when considering the complex interplay between DNA sequences and various epigenetic factors such as histone modifications and chromatin accessibility.Results Using tissue-specific 5hmC sequencing data, we introduce Deep5hmC, a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates both the DNA sequence and epigenetic features such as histone modification and chromatin accessibility to predict genome-wide 5hmC modification. The multimodal design of Deep5hmC demonstrates remarkable improvement in predicting both qualitative and quantitative 5hmC modification compared to unimodal versions of Deep5hmC and state-of-the-art machine learning methods. This improvement is demonstrated through benchmarking on a comprehensive set of 5hmC sequencing data collected at four developmental stages during forebrain organoid development and across 17 human tissues. Compared to DeepSEA and random forest, Deep5hmC achieves close to 4% and 17% improvement of Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) across four forebrain developmental stages, and 6% and 27% across 17 human tissues for predicting binary 5hmC modification sites; and 8% and 22% improvement of Spearman correlation coefficient across four forebrain developmental stages, and 17% and 30% across 17 human tissues for predicting continuous 5hmC modification. Notably, Deep5hmC showcases its practical utility by accurately predicting gene expression and identifying differentially hydroxymethylated regions (DhMRs) in a case-control study of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Deep5hmC significantly improves our understanding of tissue-specific gene regulation and facilitates the development of new biomarkers for complex diseases.Availability and implementation Deep5hmC is available via https://github.com/lichen-lab/Deep5hmC

AB Big data, high-performance computing, and (deep) machine learning are increasingly becoming key to precision medicine-from identifying disease risks and taking preventive measures, to making diagnoses and personalizing treatment for individuals. Precision medicine, however, is not only about predicting risks and outcomes, but also about weighing interventions. Interventional clinical predictive models require the correct specification of cause and effect, and the calculation of so-called counterfactuals, that is, alternative scenarios. In biomedical research, observational studies are commonly affected by confounding and selection bias. Without robust assumptions, often requiring a priori domain knowledge, causal inference is not feasible. Data-driven prediction models are often mistakenly used to draw causal effects, but neither their parameters nor their predictions necessarily have a causal interpretation. Therefore, the premise that data-driven prediction models lead to trustable decisions/interventions for precision medicine is questionable. When pursuing intervention modelling, the bio-health informatics community needs to employ causal approaches and learn causal structures. Here we discuss how target trials (algorithmic emulation of randomized studies), transportability (the licence to transfer causal effects from one population to another) and prediction invariance (where a true causal model is contained in the set of all prediction models whose accuracy does not vary across different settings) are linchpins to developing and testing intervention models.
   Machine learning models are commonly used to predict risks and outcomes in biomedical research. But healthcare often requires information about cause-effect relations and alternative scenarios, that is, counterfactuals. Prosperi et al. discuss the importance of interventional and counterfactual models, as opposed to purely predictive models, in the context of precision medicine.

AB Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is a burgeoning new field that has increased in popularity over the past couple of years, coinciding with the public release of large language model (LLM)-driven chatbots. These chatbots, such as ChatGPT, can be engaged directly in conversation, allowing users to ask them questions or issue other commands. Since LLMs are trained on large amounts of text data, they can also answer questions reliably and factually, an ability that has allowed them to serve as a source for medical inquiries. This study seeks to assess the readability of patient education materials on cardiac catheterization across four of the most common chatbots: ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, and Meta AI. Methodology: A set of 10 questions regarding cardiac catheterization was developed using website-based patient education materials on the topic. We then asked these questions in consecutive order to four of the most common chatbots: ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, and Meta AI. The Flesch Reading Ease Score (FRES) was used to assess the readability score. Readability grade levels were assessed using six tools: Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL), Gunning Fog Index (GFI), Coleman-Liau Index (CLI), Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) Index, Automated Readability Index (ARI), and FORCAST Grade Level. Results: The mean FRES across all four chatbots was 40.2, while overall mean grade levels for the four chatbots were 11.2, 13.7, 13.7, 13.3, 11.2, and 11.6 across the FKGL, GFI, CLI, SMOG, ARI, and FORCAST indices, respectively. Mean reading grade levels across the six tools were 14.8 for ChatGPT, 12.3 for Microsoft Copilot, 13.1 for Google Gemini, and 9.6 for Meta AI. Further, FRES values for the four chatbots were 31, 35.8, 36.4, and 57.7, respectively. Conclusions: This study shows that AI chatbots are capable of providing answers to medical questions regarding cardiac catheterization. However, the responses across the four chatbots had overall mean reading grade levels at the 11th th-13th th-grade level, depending on the tool used. This means that the materials were at the high school and even college reading level, which far exceeds the recommended sixth-grade level for patient education materials. Further, there is significant variability in the readability levels provided by different chatbots as, across all six grade-level assessments, Meta AI had the lowest scores and ChatGPT generally had the highest.

AB Deep neural networks suffer from poor generalization to unseen environments when the underlying data distribution is different from that in the training set. By learning minimum sufficient representations from training data, the information bottleneck (IB) approach has demonstrated its effectiveness to improve generalization in different AI applications. In this work, we propose a new neural network-based IB approach, termed gated information bottleneck (GIB), that dynamically drops spurious correlations and progressively selects the most task-relevant features across different environments by a trainable soft mask (on raw features). Using the recently proposed matrix-based Renyi's alpha-order mutual information estimator, GIB enjoys a simple and tractable objective, without any variational approximation or distributional assumption. We empirically demonstrate the superiority of GIB over other popular neural network-based IB approaches in adversarial robustness and out-of-distribution detection. Meanwhile, we also establish the connection between IB theory and invariant causal representation learning and observed that GIB demonstrates appealing performance when different environments arrive sequentially, a more practical scenario where invariant risk minimization fails.

AB Background Advancements in machine learning (ML) have improved the accuracy of models that predict human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) incidence. These models have used electronic medical records and registries. We aim to broaden the application of these tools by using deidentified public health datasets for notifiable sexually transmitted infections (STIs) from a southern US county known for high HIV incidence. The goal is to assess the feasibility and accuracy of ML in predicting HIV incidence, which could inform and enhance public health interventions.Methods We analyzed 2 deidentified public health datasets from January 2010 to December 2021, focusing on notifiable STIs. Our process involved data processing and feature extraction, including sociodemographic factors, STI cases, and social vulnerability index (SVI) metrics. Various ML models were trained and evaluated for predicting HIV incidence using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.Results We included 85 224 individuals; 2027 (2.37%) were newly diagnosed with HIV during the study period. The ML models demonstrated high performance in predicting HIV incidence among males and females. Influential features for males included age at STI diagnosis, previous STI information, provider type, and SVI. For females, predictive features included age, ethnicity, previous STI information, overall SVI, and race.Conclusions The high accuracy of our ML models in predicting HIV incidence highlights the potential of using public health datasets for public health interventions such as tailored HIV testing and prevention. While these findings are promising, further research is needed to translate these models into practical public health applications.
   We applied machine learning to predict HIV incidence in a high-incidence US county using deidentified public health data, focusing on sociodemographic factors and sexually transmitted infections. The models showed high accuracy, suggesting the potential for guiding public health strategies.

ID MANAGEMENT; MODEL
AB Knowing pecan nut growth dynamic and its thermal requirements from bloom to ripening are essential to predict nut size and harvest date. However, monitoring of pecan growth (shuck, shell, and embryo) is a time consuming manual task, requiring multiple measurements for each nut. This process also ignores any deformation of the nut. A computer vision system can facilitate such a task by performing pixel-by-pixel semantic segmentation for all parts of the nut. This study uses the Mask-RCNN algorithm for object detection and semantic segmentation for area estimation of shuck, shell, and embryo on pecans in multiple growth stages. The dataset was divided in two stages: small (young) and big (older) pecans. The network chosen achieved an F1 score of 95.3% to 100% on the models for the object detection task. The area estimation achieved a mean absolute percentage error of 10.14% to 28.06% on these tasks. The resulting growth plot presents a sigmoid curve for all parts of the nut, which demonstrates the precision of the measurement. This automated measuring system makes it possible to have a multidimensional understanding of each aspect of nut development, and gives us the ability of modeling nut growth phenology and predicting nut productions.

ID JOB-SHOP; GENETIC ALGORITHM; BOTTLENECK; RULES
AB We propose a new approach, called Augmented Neural Networks (AugNN) for solving the task-scheduling problem. This approach is a hybrid of the heuristic and the neural networks approaches. While retaining all the advantages of the heuristic approach, AugNN incorporates learning, to find improved solutions iteratively. This new framework maps the problem structure to a neural network and utilizes domain specific knowledge for finding solutions. The problem we address is that of minimizing the makespan in scheduling n tasks on m machines where the tasks follow a precedence relation and task pre-emption is not allowed. Solutions obtained from AugNN using various learning rules are compared with six different commonly used heuristics. AugNN approach provides significant improvements over heuristic results. In just a few iterations, the gap between the lower bound and the obtained solution is reduced by as much as 58% for some heuristics, without any increase in computational complexity. While the heuristics found solutions in the range of 5.8-26.9% of the lower bound, on average, AugNN found solutions in the range of 3.3-11.1%, a significant improvement. (C) 2002 Elsevier B.V.

AB This study looked at the development of six deep learning artificial neural network models for detecting ripeness stage in wild blueberries, along with developing models for yield estimation. The six networks used were YOLOv3, YOLOv3-SPP, YOLOv3-Tiny, YOLOv4, YOLOv4-Small and YOLOv4-Tiny. Both 3-class (green berries, red berries, blue berries) and 2-class (unripe berries, ripe berries) models were developed with YOLOv4 performing the best with mean average precisions of 79.79% and 88.12% respectively. This result was further supported by YOLOv4 achieving the highest F1 score of 0.82. YOLOv4-Tiny performed the best from a computational load perspective having a mean inference time of 7.8 ms and a mean memory usage of 1.63 GB for single 1280 x 736 pixel images. Only minor differences in the accuracy of the nonlinear regression yield prediction models were detected, with YOLOv4-Small performing the best with a mean absolute error of 24.1%. Despite this error, the results are encouraging, and this novel approach to yield estimation in wild blueberries will aid growers in making better, more localized, management decisions, improving yields and ultimately increasing profits by better understanding their fields ripening characteristics.

AB Deep learning architectures are an extremely powerful tool for recognizing and classifying images. However, they require supervised learning and normally work on vectors of the size of image pixels and produce the best results when trained on millions of object images. To help mitigate these issues, we propose an end-to-end architecture that fuses bottom-up saliency and top-down attention with an object recognition module to focus on relevant data and learn important features that can later be fine-tuned for a specific task, employing only unsupervised learning. In addition, by utilizing a virtual fovea that focuses on relevant portions of the data, the training speed can be greatly improved. We test the performance of the proposed Gamma saliency technique on the Toronto and CAT 2000 databases, and the foveated vision in the large Street View House Numbers (SVHN) database. The results with foveated vision show that Gamma saliency performs at the same level as the best alternative algorithms while being computationally faster. The results in SVHN show that our unsupervised cognitive architecture is comparable to fully supervised methods and that saliency also improves CNN performance if desired. Finally, we develop and test a top-down attention mechanism based on the Gamma saliency applied to the top layer of CNNs to facilitate scene understanding in multi-object cluttered images. We show that the extra information from top-down saliency is capable of speeding up the extraction of digits in the cluttered multidigit MNIST data set, corroborating the important role of top down attention.

AB Background: Extensive time spent on documentation in electronic health records (EHRs) impedes patient care and contributes to nurse burnout. Artificial intelligence-based clinical decision support tools within the EHR, such as ChatGPT, can provide care plan recommendations to the perinatal nurse. The lack of explicit methodologies for effectively integrating ChatGPT led to our initiative to build and demonstrate our ChatGPT-4 prompt to support nurse care planning. Methods: We employed our process model, previously tested with 22 diverse medical-surgical patient scenarios, to generate a tailored prompt for ChatGPT-4 to produce care plan suggestions for an exemplar patient presenting with preterm labor and gestational diabetes. A comparative analysis was conducted by evaluating the output against a "nurse-generated care plan" developed by our team of nurses on content alignment, accuracy of standardized nursing terminology, and prioritization of care. Results: ChatGPT-4 delivered suggestions for nursing diagnoses, interventions, and outcomes comparable to the "nurse-generated care plan." It accurately identified major care areas, avoided irrelevant or unnecessary recommendations, and identified top priority care. Of the 24 labels generated by ChatGPT-4, 16 correctly utilized standardized nursing terminology. Conclusion: This demonstration of the use of our ChatGPT-4 prompt illustrates the potential of leveraging a large language model to assist perinatal nurses in creating care plans. The next steps are improving the accuracy of ChatGPT-4-generated standardized nursing terminology and integrating our prompt into EHRs. This work supports our broader goal of enhancing patient outcomes while mitigating the burden of documentation that contributes to nurse burnout.

AB Network-on-chip (NoC) is widely used to facilitate communication between components in sophisticated system-on-chip (SoC) designs. Security of the on-chip communication is crucial because exploiting any vulnerability in shared NoC would be a goldmine for an attacker that puts the entire computing infrastructure at risk. We investigate the security strength of existing anonymous routing protocols in NoC architectures, making two pivotal contributions. Firstly, we develop and perform a machine learning (ML)-based flow correlation attack on existing anonymous routing techniques in NoC systems, revealing that they provide only packet-level anonymity. Secondly, we propose a novel, lightweight anonymous routing protocol featuring outbound traffic tunneling and traffic obfuscation. This protocol is designed to provide robust defense against ML-based flow correlation attacks, ensuring both packet-level and flow-level anonymity. Experimental evaluation using both real and synthetic traffic demonstrates that our proposed attack successfully deanonymizes state-of-the-art anonymous routing in NoC architectures with high accuracy (up to 99%) for diverse traffic patterns. It also reveals that our lightweight anonymous routing protocol can defend against ML-based attacks with minor hardware and performance overhead.

AB Accurate knowledge of surface and subsurface soil moisture (SM) is essential for hydrologic modeling, weather forecasting, and agricultural water management. NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite (level 3) provides 'surface' SM with 2-3 days temporal resolution, hence lacks daily and subsurface SM information. This study developed a convolutional neural network-long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) deep learning model to produce 'daily' surface (5 cm) and subsurface (25 cm) SM products (9 km) by integrating SMAP level 3 ancillary data, North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS-2; 12 km) SM, and Soil Landscapes of the United States (SOLUS100) digital maps across the contiguous U.S. Two input scenarios were evaluated: scenario 1 used only SMAP ancillary data, while scenario 2 included both SMAP ancillary data and SOLUS100 soil maps. Model evaluation with in situ SM data showed higher accuracy for scenario 2, indicating the importance of soil properties (texture and bulk density) in SM estimation. Coarse-textured soils showed the highest estimation accuracy, followed by medium- and fine-textured soils. The model also performed in estimating subsurface SM than surface SM for most land-cover types. Incorporating SMAP ancillary data and SOLUS100 digital soil maps into the ConvLSTM improved the spatial and temporal estimation of surface and subsurface SM. The results highlight the potential of deep learning for integrating multi-source multi-scale observations for improving SM estimation at large scale.

ID QUANTITATIVE-DETERMINATION; EDIBLE OILS; SYSTEM
AB Insects used as food and feed has attracted considerable attention for their nutritional profiles in recent years. Fatty acid profile, such as unsaturated fatty acid content, ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids, determines the quality of insect products. Multiple previous studies have used spectroscopy technologies and machine learning algorithms to predict fatty acid content in various foods and feeds. However, these approaches were not applied for predicting fatty acid content in insects before. In this study, 50 insect samples containing 9 commercial insect species were collected. Machine learning methods were applied to build the calibration models to predict fatty acid content from Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy spectra. For all fatty acids, partial least square regression, regression trees and neural network based methods were among the best machine learning methods. For the best performing model, a coefficient of determination of 0.98, a root mean square error of prediction of 3.19%, and a ratio of performance of 3.91 were achieved using regression tree to predict linoleic acid. The high model performance indicates the potential of applying FTIR and such machine learning methods for fast and non-destructive prediction of fatty acid of insect oil products.

AB Influenza viruses are detected year-round over the world and the viruses will usually circulate during fall and winter, causing the seasonal flu. The growing novel variants of influenza viruses pose a significant concern to public health annually. However, the rapid mutation of the influenza viruses makes it challenging to timely track their evolution. Therefore, a fast, low-cost, and precise method to predict the antigenic variant of influenza viruses could help vaccine development and prevent viral transmission. In this study, we propose a multi-channel convolutional neural network using contrastive learning to predict the antigenicity of influenza A viruses. An integrated dataset containing antigenic data and protein sequences was collected from various public resources and literature. The experimental results on three different influenza subtypes indicate our proposed model outperforms other traditional machine learning classifiers for antigenicity prediction. In addition, it also demonstrates superior performance over several state-of-the-art approaches, with 5.18 %, 7.03 % and 7.82 % increase in accuracy compared to the best results for H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1, respectively. The proposed framework is timely and effective in influenza antigenicity prediction and can be adapted to the study of other viruses.

AB Computational modeling of chemical and biological systems at atomic resolution is a crucial tool in the chemist's toolset. The use of computer simulations requires a balance between cost and accuracy: quantum-mechanical methods provide high accuracy but are computationally expensive and scale poorly to large systems, while classical force fields are cheap and scalable, but lack transferability to new systems. Machine learning can be used to achieve the best of both approaches. Here we train a general-purpose neural network potential (ANI-1ccx) that approaches CCSD(T)/CBS accuracy on benchmarks for reaction thermochemistry, isomerization, and drug-like molecular torsions. This is achieved by training a network to DFT data then using transfer learning techniques to retrain on a dataset of gold standard QM calculations (CCSD(T)/CBS) that optimally spans chemical space. The resulting potential is broadly applicable to materials science, biology, and chemistry, and billions of times faster than CCSD(T)/CBS calculations.

AB Based upon narrative persuasion literature, we argue that each influencer post (consisted of both textual and visual information) is an exemplar of narratives in which there are the main character(s) and a storyline. To reveal the content strategies used by social media influencers, we adopted a combined use of machine learning-based topic analysis and deep learning-based image analysis in order to examine the content of captions and photos contained in Instagram influencer posts. These 7,745 posts were uploaded by the top ten young adult beauty and fashion social media influencers. Moreover, we explored how the influencer narratives impair the effectiveness of sponsorship disclosure by analyzing the disclosure language in each post as well as the engagement performances (i.e., number of likes, number of comments) of the post. Results provided empirical information regarding influencers' usage of persuasive narratives. Implications and future research directions were provided.

AB The purpose of this exploratory research study was to examine the roles instructional designers (IDs) play in the integration of generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) into their higher education institutions, and how they use GenAI technologies in their own professional practices. Data were collected from 15 participants in the United States (U.S.) in an ID role or with similar job titles (e.g., educational technologist). Using a general qualitative approach, semi- structured interviews were conducted in Zoom about IDs' use and integration of GenAI. Our analysis resulted in three primary themes related to IDs' inte gration of GenAI in online and blended education: (a) the use of GenAI for instructional design; (b) collaborative guidance for faculty integration of GenAI; and (c) training, resources, and guidelines on the integration of GenAI. A common thread through a ll the themes was IDs' conscientious and cautious approach and ethical concerns about GenAI integration. We unpack these themes and discuss the implications of IDs in higher education integrating GenAI to meet organizational, faculty, and student needs.

ID NEURAL-NETWORK; PROJECTS
AB Accurate construction cost estimation at early stages is critical to enable project stakeholders to make financial decisions (e.g., set up the project budget). However, the heavy reliance on cost engineers' subjective experience and manual effort in practice makes the estimation an error-prone and time-consuming process. To this end, this study proposes a novel hypergraph deep learning-based framework to predict the actual costs of construction projects accurately and efficiently at early stages. It starts with a systematic hypergraph formulation incorporating construction cost factors and their interrelationships. A hypergraph deep learning model is then developed based on the formulated hypergraph for end-to-end construction cost prediction. Afterwards, model interpretation is undertaken to reveal the cost factor importance from the model training results in a quantitative manner. The framework is validated using an actual construction cost dataset of school projects. The results show high accuracy in cost prediction without human intervention and meaningful interpretations of cost factor importance for better understanding of construction cost patterns.

ID AUTOMATED VEHICLES; STRATEGY
AB The recent advancements in wireless technology enable connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to gather information about their environment by vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. In this work, we design an information-sharing based multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for CAVs, to take advantage of the extra information when making decisions to improve traffic efficiency and safety. The safe actor-critic algorithm we propose has two new techniques: the truncated Q-function and safe action mapping. The truncated Q-function utilizes the shared information from neighboring CAVs such that the joint state and action spaces of the Q-function do not grow in our algorithm for a large-scale CAV system. We prove the bound of the approximation error between the truncated -Q and global Q-functions. The safe action mapping provides a provable safety guarantee for both the training and execution based on control barrier functions. Using the CARLA simulator for experiments, we show that our approach improves the CAV system's efficiency in terms of average velocity and comfort under different CAV ratios and different traffic densities. We also show that our approach avoids the execution of unsafe actions and always maintains a safe distance from other vehicles. We construct an obstacle-at-corner scenario to show that the shared vision can help CAVs to observe obstacles earlier and take action to avoid traffic jams. The experiment video is on https://songyanghan.github.io/cavmarl/.

DE Fluency assessment; speech impairment; pipelined deep learner-dual
   classifier; healthy; stuttering; specific language impairment
AB The use of machine learning algorithms for the assessment of speech fluency is increasingly becoming recognized globally due to their ability to quickly identify speech impairments. This approach is preferred over manual diagnosis, as it reduces the likelihood of human error and minimizes the delay in commencing the therapy. A pipelined deep learner-dual classifier (PDL-DC) is proposed for the automated detection of speech impairment. The assessment of individuals' speech fluency consisted of two distinct phases: the classification of speech disfluencies and the categorization of fluency disorders. Speech disfluencies, including revisions, prolongations, whole-word repetitions, word-medial repetitions, and filled pauses, were categorized into distinct groupings. The second aspect of classification pertains to the assessment of fluency levels, wherein speakers are classified into three categories: healthy individuals, individuals with stuttering, and individuals with Specific Language Impairment (SLI). The proposed model's implementation of a pipelined design enables the dual validation of a subject's fluency. The proposed model demonstrates an average classification accuracy, precision, and recall of 97%.

ID MUSCULOSKELETAL MODELS; SIMULATIONS
AB Subject-specific musculoskeletal models are a promising avenue for personalized healthcare. However, current methods for producing personalized models require dense, biomechanical datasets that include expensive and time-consuming physiological measurements. For personalized models to be clinically useful, we must be able to rapidly generate models from simple, easy to collect data. In this context, the objective of this paper is to evaluate if and how simple data, namely height/weight and pinch force data, can be used to achieve model personalization via machine learning. Using simulated lateral pinch force measurements from a synthetic population of 40,000 randomly generated subjects, we train neural networks to estimate four Hill-type muscle model parameters and bone density. We compare parameter estimates to the true parameters of 10,000 additional synthetic subjects. We also generate new personalized models using the parameter estimates and perform new lateral pinch simulations to compare predicted forces using these personalized models to those generated using a baseline model. We demonstrate that increasing force measurement complexity reduces the root-mean-square error in the majority of parameter estimates. Additionally, musculoskeletal models using neural network-based parameter estimates provide up to an 80% reduction in absolute error in simulated forces when compared to a generic model. Thus, easily obtained force measurements may be suitable for personalizing models of the thumb, although extending the method to more tasks and models involving other joints likely requires additional measurements.

First, we apply deep belief network to learn local and high-level features from the local neighbour of a given pixel in an unsupervised manner. Second, a back propagation algorithm is improved to build a DI based on selected training samples, which can highlight the difference on changed regions and suppress the false changes on unchanged regions. Finally, we get the change trajectory map using simple clustering analysis. The proposed scheme is tested on three remote-sensing data sets. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show its superior performance compared to the traditional pixel-level and texture-level-based approaches.

AB Purpose:To compare texture-based analysis using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) against lung densitometry in detecting chest computed tomography (CT) image abnormalities.Material and Methods:A U-NET was used for lung segmentation, and an ensemble of 7 CNN architectures was trained for the classification of low-attenuation areas (LAAs; emphysema, cysts), normal-attenuation areas (NAAs; normal parenchyma), and high-attenuation areas (HAAs; ground-glass opacities, crazy paving/linear opacity, consolidation). Lung densitometry also computes (LAAs, <=-950 HU), NAAs (-949 to -700 HU), and HAAs (-699 to -250 HU). CNN-based and densitometry-based severity indices (CNN and Dens, respectively) were calculated as (LAA+HAA)/(LAA+NAA+HAA) in 812 CT scans from 176 normal subjects, 343 patients with emphysema, and 293 patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD). The correlation between CNN-derived and densitometry-derived indices was analyzed, alongside a comparison of severity indices among patient subgroups with emphysema and ILD, using the Spearman correlation and ANOVA with Bonferroni correction.Results:CNN-derived and densitometry-derived severity indices (SIs) showed a strong correlation (rho=0.90) and increased with disease severity. CNN-SIs differed from densitometry SIs, being lower for emphysema and higher for moderate to severe ILD cases. CNN estimations for normal attenuation areas were higher than those from densitometry across all groups, indicating a potential for more accurate characterization of lung abnormalities.Conclusions:CNN outputs align closely with densitometry in assessing lung abnormalities on CT scans, offering improved estimates of normal areas and better distinguishing similar abnormalities. However, this requires higher computing power.

AB Conventional reinforcement-learning methods for Markov decision processes rely on weakly guided, stochastic searches to drive the learning process. It can therefore be difficult to predict what agent behaviors might emerge. In this paper, we consider an information-theoretic cost function for performing constrained stochastic searches that promote the formation of risk-averse to risk-favoring behaviors. This cost function is the value of information, which provides the optimal tradeoff between the expected return of a policy and the policy's complexity; policy complexity is measured by number of hits and controlled by a single hyperparameter on the cost function. As the policy complexity is reduced, the agents will increasingly eschew risky actions. This reduces the potential for high accrued rewards. As the policy complexity increases, the agents will take actions, regardless of the risk, that can raise the long-term rewards. The obtainable reward depends on a single, tunable hyperparameter that regulates the degree of policy complexity. We evaluate the performance of value-ofinformation-based policies on a stochastic version of Ms. Pac-Man. A major component of this paper is the demonstration that ranges of policy complexity values yield different game-play styles and explaining why this occurs. We also show that our reinforcement-learning search mechanism is more efficient than the others we utilize. This result implies that the value-of-information theory is appropriate for framing the exploitation-exploration tradeoff in reinforcement learning.

AB The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology has shown significant promise in the identification of acute intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs). However, it is crucial to recognize that AI systems may produce false-positive results, especially in the postoperative period. Here, we present two cases where AI prioritization software erroneously identified an acute ICH on a postoperative non-contrast CT. These cases highlight the need for a more careful radiology review of AI-flagged images in postoperative patients to avoid further unnecessary imaging and unwarranted concerns from radiologists, clinicians, and patients.

ID REPRESENTATION
AB Feature representation is an important aspect of remote-sensing-based image classification. While deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) are able to effectively amalgamate information, large numbers of parameters often make learned features inscrutable and difficult to transfer to alternative models. In order to better represent statistical texture information for remote-sensing image classification, in this letter, we investigate performing joint dimensionality reduction (DR) and classification using a novel histogram neural network. Motivated by a popular DR approach, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), our proposed method incorporates a classification loss computed on samples in a low-dimensional embedding space. We compare the learned sample embeddings against coordinates found by t-SNE in terms of classification accuracy and qualitative assessment. We also explore the use of various divergence measures in the t-SNE objective. The proposed method has several advantages such as readily embedding out-of-sample points and reducing feature dimensionality while retaining class discriminability. Our results show that the proposed approach maintains and/or improves classification performance and reveals characteristics of features produced by neural networks that may be helpful for other applications.

AB BackgroundGiven their ability to process highly dimensional datasets with hundreds of variables, machine learning algorithms may offer one solution to the vexing challenge of predicting postoperative pain.
   MethodsHere, we report on the application of machine learning algorithms to predict postoperative pain outcomes in a retrospective cohort of 8,071 surgical patients using 796 clinical variables. Five algorithms were compared in terms of their ability to forecast moderate to severe postoperative pain: Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), gradient-boosted decision tree, support vector machine, neural network, and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), with logistic regression included for baseline comparison.
   ResultsIn forecasting moderate to severe postoperative pain for postoperative day (POD) 1, the LASSO algorithm, using all 796 variables, had the highest accuracy with an area under the receiver-operating curve (ROC) of 0.704. Next, the gradient-boosted decision tree had an ROC of 0.665 and the k-NN algorithm had an ROC of 0.643. For POD 3, the LASSO algorithm, using all variables, again had the highest accuracy, with an ROC of 0.727. Logistic regression had a lower ROC of 0.5 for predicting pain outcomes on POD 1 and 3.
   ConclusionsMachine learning algorithms, when combined with complex and heterogeneous data from electronic medical record systems, can forecast acute postoperative pain outcomes with accuracies similar to methods that rely only on variables specifically collected for pain outcome prediction.

AB Computational materials discovery has grown in utility over the past decade due to advances in computing power and crystal structure prediction algorithms (CSPA). However, the computational cost of the ab initio calculations required by CSPA limits its utility to small unit cells, reducing the compositional and structural space the algorithms can explore. Past studies have bypassed unneeded ab initio calculations by utilizing machine learning to predict the stability of a material. Specifically, graph neural networks trained on large datasets of relaxed structures display high fidelity in predicting formation energy. Unfortunately, the geometries of structures produced by CSPA deviate from the relaxed state, which leads to poor predictions, hindering the model's ability to filter unstable material. To remedy this behavior, we propose a simple, physically motivated, computationally efficient perturbation technique that augments training data, improving predictions on unrelaxed structures by 66%. Finally, we show how this error reduction can accelerate CSPA.

AB We propose a general learning based framework for solving nonsmooth and nonconvex image reconstruction problems. We model the regularization function as the composition of the l2,1 norm and a smooth but nonconvex feature mapping parametrized as a deep convolutional neural network. We develop a descent-type algorithm to solve the nonsmooth nonconvex minimization problem by leveraging Nesterov's smoothing technique and the idea of residual learning, and learn the network parameters such that the outputs of the algorithm match the references in training data. Our method is versatile as one can employ various modern network structures into the regularization, and the resulting network inherits the convergence properties of the algorithm. We also show that the proposed network is parameter-efficient, and its performance compares favorably to the state-of-the-art methods in a variety of image reconstruction problems in practice.

AB Deep learning is revolutionizing many areas of science and technology, especially image, text, and speech recognition. In this paper, we demonstrate how a deep neural network (NN) trained on quantum mechanical (QM) DFT calculations can learn an accurate and transferable potential for organic molecules. We introduce ANAKIN-ME (Accurate NeurAl networK engINe for Molecular Energies) or ANI for short. ANI is a new method designed with the intent of developing transferable neural network potentials that utilize a highly-modified version of the Behler and Parrinello symmetry functions to build single-atom atomic environment vectors (AEV) as a molecular representation. AEVs provide the ability to train neural networks to data that spans both configurational and conformational space, a feat not previously accomplished on this scale. We utilized ANI to build a potential called ANI-1, which was trained on a subset of the GDB databases with up to 8 heavy atoms in order to predict total energies for organic molecules containing four atom types: H, C, N, and O. To obtain an accelerated but physically relevant sampling of molecular potential surfaces, we also proposed a Normal Mode Sampling (NMS) method for generating molecular conformations. Through a series of case studies, we show that ANI-1 is chemically accurate compared to reference DFT calculations on much larger molecular systems (up to 54 atoms) than those included in the training data set.

AB Neural networks are a contending data mining procedure to estimate propensity scores due to its robustness to non-normal residual distributions, ability to detect complex nonlinear relationships between treatments and confounding variables, nonessential model specification, and compatibility to train based on observed events. In this study, we develop artificial neural network architectures to estimate propensity scores for categorical treatments. For comparison, we estimated propensity scores with more popular techniques: logistic regression, multinomial logistic regression, and generalized boosted logistic regression using regression trees (GBM). Previous studies found lower prediction error of GBM compared with alternative methods and demonstrated that it does not require model specification yet mentions several cases of overfitting. We used Monte Carlo simulations manipulating sample coefficients, model specifications, and fixed sample sizes to compare the generalization error of trained machine-learning algorithms to never-before-seen data. Neural networks resulted in higher correlations between true propensity scores and estimated propensity scores. Also, other performance measures, such as cross-entropy values, suggest that artificial neural networks may be more accurate than more popular methods to estimate propensity scores.

AB Objective Our article demonstrates the effectiveness of using a validated framework to create a ChatGPT prompt that generates valid nursing care plan suggestions for one hypothetical older patient with lung cancer.Method This study describes the methodology for creating ChatGPT prompts that generate consistent care plan suggestions and its application for a lung cancer case scenario. After entering a nursing assessment of the patient's condition into ChatGPT, we asked it to generate care plan suggestions. Subsequently, we assessed the quality of the care plans produced by ChatGPT.Results While not all the suggested care plan terms (11 out of 16) utilized standardized nursing terminology, the ChatGPT-generated care plan closely matched the gold standard in scope and nature, correctly prioritizing oxygenation and ventilation needs.Conclusion Using a validated framework prompt to generate nursing care plan suggestions with ChatGPT demonstrates its potential value as a decision support tool for optimizing cancer care documentation.

AB New advancements in technology have made machines teachers, or technology-powered robots or AI that assist in the overall learning experience, a possibility. Though adoption rates are currently low, colleges and universities will likely incorporate some aspects of machine teachers (e.g., AI, robots) in their curriculums in the foreseeable future. However, little is known about how to create an effective machine teacher-based education. As an initial step, the present study examines whether an AI instructor's communication style would have an impact on students' perceptions about an AI instructor-based education. To test this inquiry, the study conducted an online experiment using a 2 (communication styles: functional vs. relational) x 2 (course topic: natural science vs. social science) between-subjects design. Primary results indicate that students develop more favorable perceptions about an AI instructor-based education when the AI instructor is relational rather than functional. This tendency is particularly strong when listening to a social science lecture. Further, social presence of an AI instructor functions as a mediator, which explains the reason why a relational AI instructor leads to more favorable perceptions about an AI instructor-based education is because of one's social presence of an AI instructor. Collectively, the study's findings indicate the importance of communication styles and social presence of an AI instructor.

DT Article
AB Perovskite materials, renowned for their versatility and remarkable properties, pose challenges in discovering optimal candidates due to the vast compositional space. Data-driven machine learning (ML) offers promise in expediting material discovery; however, the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency across different ML models for predicting perovskite properties is not well-understood. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of various ML models for predicting the formation energy (E-f) and band gap (E-g) of perovskites. We designed a protocol to extract perovskite structures from three databases based on the stoichiometry, octahedral lattice motif, and alignment with established perovskite prototype structures. Benchmarking conventional ML algorithms (CML) against graph neural network (GNN) models across three data sets, we identified LGBM and GATGNN models as the top performers for CML and GNN, respectively, balancing exceptional prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. We further investigated the impact of the data size on model performance, emphasizing the need for over 1000 data points for optimal prediction accuracy. Additionally, through SHAP analysis, we provided valuable insights into the interpretation of CML models in predicting E-f and E-g. Our study establishes a standardized benchmark for evaluating various ML models across diverse data sets of perovskite materials, facilitating future applications in materials science, particularly in model selection and advancement of perovskite materials.

TI Reconstruction of decays to merged photons using end-to-end deep

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
LA English
DT Article
AB A novel technique based on machine learning is introduced to reconstruct the decays of highly Lorentz boosted particles. Using an end-to-end deep learning strategy, the technique bypasses existing rule-based particle reconstruction methods typically used in high energy physics analyses. It uses minimally processed detector data as input and directly outputs particle properties of interest. The new technique is demonstrated for the reconstruction of the invariant mass of particles decaying in the CMS detector. The decay of a hypothetical scalar particle A into two photons, A gamma gamma, is chosen as a benchmark decay. Lorentz boosts gamma L 1/4 60-600 are considered, ranging from regimes where both photons are resolved to those where the photons are closely merged as one object. A training method using domain continuation is introduced, enabling the invariant mass reconstruction of unresolved photon pairs in a novel way. The new technique is validated using pi 0 gamma gamma decays in LHC collision data.

AB Accurate in-season crop phenology estimation (CPE) using remote sensing (RS)-based machine-learning methods is challenging because of limited ground-truth data. In this study, a biophysical crop model was used to guide neural network (NN)-based, in-season CPE. Using the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT), we conducted uncalibrated simulations for corn (Zea mays L.) across Iowa and Illinois in the U.S. Midwest with in-season weather and historical information for planting and harvest. We investigated guiding the NN CPE method with growth stage (GSTD) and water stress factor (WSF) outputs from these simulations. Results show that guided NNs are able to estimate onset and progression of phenological stages more accurately than an unguided baseline and a crop model-only method. GSTD guidance improved CPE during seasons when progress deviated from a regional average because of temperature but was detrimental during seasons of delayed planting and harvest. WSF guidance improved CPE during seasons when planting and harvest were delayed by heavy rainfall but performed less well during grainfill and mature stages. Neural network-based CPE guided by both GSTD and WSF provided the most accurate estimates for pre-emergence, emerged, silking, and grainfill stages as well as lower RMSE for the median stage transition date than reported in three full-season CPE studies. An accurate RS method for estimating planting could link DSSAT simulations to the current planting window and improve upon these results. This model-guided approach can be extended to other crops and regions to unlock in-season crop risk assessments that are directly linked to crop phenology.

TI Acoustic detection and classification of microchiroptera using machine
   learning: Lessons learned from automatic speech recognition
SO JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
LA English
DT Article
ID ECHOLOCATION CALLS; IDENTIFICATION; BAT; CONSEQUENCES; HABITAT
AB Current automatic acoustic detection and classification of microchiroptera utilize global features of individual calls (i.e., duration, bandwidth, frequency extrema), an approach that stems from expert knowledge of call sonograms. This approach parallels the acoustic phonetic paradigm of human automatic speech recognition (ASR), which relied on expert knowledge to account for variations in canonical linguistic units. ASR research eventually shifted from acoustic phonetics to machine learning, primarily because of the superior ability of machine learning to account for signal variation. To compare machine learning with conventional methods of detection and classification, nearly 3000 search-phase calls were hand labeled from recordings of five species: Pipistrellus bodenheimeri., Molossus molossus, Lasiurus borealis, L. cinereus semotus, and Tadarida brasiliensis. The hand labels were used to train two machine learning models: a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for detection and classification and a hidden Markov model (HMM) for classification. The GMM detector produced 4% error compared to 32% error for a baseline broadband energy detector, while the GMM and HMM classifiers produced errors of 0.6 +/- 0.2% compared to 16.9 +/- 1.1% error for a baseline discriminant function analysis classifier. The experiments showed that machine learning algorithms produced errors an order of magnitude smaller than those for conventional methods. (c) 2006 Acoustical Society of America.

AB The human brain is arguably the most complex "machine" to ever exist. Its detailed functioning is yet to be fully understood, let alone modelled. Neurological processes have logical signal-processing and biophysical aspects, and both affect the brain's structure, functioning and adaptation. Mathematical approaches based on both information and graph theory have been extensively used in an attempt to approximate its biological functioning, along with Artificial Intelligence frameworks inspired by its logical functioning. In this article, an approach to model some aspects of the brain learning and signal processing is presented, mimicking the metastability and backpropagation found in the real brain while also accounting for neuroplasticity. Several simulations are carried out with this model to demonstrate how dynamic neuroplasticity, neural inhibition and neuron migration can reshape the brain's logical connectivity to synchronise signal processing and obtain certain target latencies. This work showcases the importance of dynamic logical and biophysical remodelling in brain plasticity. Combining mathematical (agents, graph theory, topology and backpropagation) and biomedical ingredients (metastability, neuroplasticity and migration), these preliminary results prove complex brain phenomena can be reproduced-under pertinent simplifications-via affordable computations, which can be construed as a starting point for more ambitiously accurate simulations.

AB Advanced machine learning techniques have been used in remote sensing (RS) applications such as crop mapping and yield prediction, but remain under-utilized for tracking crop progress. In this study, we demonstrate the use of agronomic knowledge of crop growth drivers in a Long Short-Term Memory-based, domain-guided neural network (DgNN) for in-season crop progress estimation. The DgNN uses a branched structure and attention to separate independent crop growth drivers and captures their varying importance throughout the growing season. The DgNN is implemented for corn, using RS data in Iowa, U.S., for the period 2003-2019, with United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) crop progress reports used as ground truth. State-wide DgNN performance shows significant improvement over sequential and dense-only NN structures, and a widely-used Hidden Markov Model method. The DgNN had a 4.0% higher Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency over all growth stages and 39% more weeks with highest cosine similarity than the next best NN during test years. The DgNN and Sequential NN were more robust during periods of abnormal crop progress, though estimating the Silking-Grainfill transition was difficult for all methods. Finally, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection visualizations of layer activations showed how LSTM-based NNs separate crop growth time-series differently from a dense-only structure. Results from this study exhibit both the viability of NNs in crop growth stage estimation (CGSE) and the benefits of using domain knowledge. The DgNN methodology presented here can be extended to provide near-real time CGSE of other crops.

AB Quantitative bioactivity and toxicity assessment of chemical compounds plays a central role in drug discovery as it saves a substantial amount of resources. To this end, high-performance computing has enabled researchers and practitioners to leverage hundreds, or even thousands, of computed molecular descriptors for the activity prediction of candidate compounds. In this paper, we evaluate the utility of two large groups of chemical descriptors by such predictive modelling, as well as chemical structure discovery, through empirical analysis. We use a suite of commercially available and in-house software to calculate molecular descriptors for two sets of chemical mutagens - a homogeneous set of 95 amines, and a diverse set of 508 chemicals. Using calculated descriptors, we model the mutagenic activity of these compounds using a number of methods from the statistics and machine-learning literature, and use robust principal component analysis to investigate the low-dimensional subspaces that characterize these chemicals. Our results suggest that combining different sets of descriptors is likely to result in a better predictive model - but that depends on the compounds being modelled and the modelling technique being used.

AB Motivation: Sequence-based deep learning approaches have been shown to predict a multitude of functional genomic readouts, including regions of open chromatin and RNA expression of genes. However, a major limitation of current methods is that model interpretation relies on computationally demanding post hoc analyses, and even then, one can often not explain the internal mechanics of highly parameterized models. Here, we introduce a deep learning architecture called totally interpretable sequence-to-function model (tiSFM). tiSFM improves upon the performance of standard multilayer convolutional models while using fewer parameters. Additionally, while tiSFM is itself technically a multilayer neural network, internal model parameters are intrinsically interpretable in terms of relevant sequence motifs.Results: We analyze published open chromatin measurements across hematopoietic lineage cell-types and demonstrate that tiSFM outperforms a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network model custom-tailored to this dataset. We also show that it correctly identifies context-specific activities of transcription factors with known roles in hematopoietic differentiation, including Pax5 and Ebf1 for B-cells, and Rorc for innate lymphoid cells. tiSFM's model parameters have biologically meaningful interpretations, and we show the utility of our approach on a complex task of predicting the change in epigenetic state as a function of developmental transition.Availability and implementationThe source code, including scripts for the analysis of key findings, can be found at , implemented in Python.

AB Traditional grain size determination in materials characterization involves microscopy images and a laborious process requiring significant manual input and human expertise. In recent years, the development of computer vision (CV) has provided an alternative approach to microstructural characterization with preliminary implementations greatly simplifying the grain size determination process. Here, an end-to-end workflow to measure grain size in microscopy images without any manual input is presented. Following the ASTM standards for grain size determination, results from the line intercept (Heyn's method) and planimetric (Saltykov's method) approaches are used as the baseline. A pre-trained holistically nested edge detection (HED) model is used for CV-based edge detection, and the results are further compared to the classic Canny edge detection method. Post-processing was performed using open-source image processing packages to extract the grain size. In optical microscope images, the pre-trained HED model achieves much higher accuracy than the Canny edge detection method while reducing the image processing time by one to two orders of magnitude compared to traditional methods. The effects of morphological operations on the predicted grain size accuracy are also explored. Overall, the proposed end-to-end convolutional neural network (CNN)-based workflow can significantly reduce the processing time while maintaining the same accuracy as the traditional manual method.

AB IoT systems are used for performing a variety of essential tasks in wide-ranging sectors, such as healthcare, smart cities, agriculture, and industrial automation. Most of these systems incorporate smartness for intelligent decision making using artificial intelligence (AI) approaches. To reduce the network bandwidth usage and load on the cloud server, there is a push to relegate most of these AI-related computations to edge IoT devices/systems. Hence, to ensure good performance, the edge devices must be systematically designed with an emphasis on the respective AI requirements from exploration to deployment. State-of-the-art IoT device and system design practices place little importance on the AI specifications during the early stages of the system development resulting in systems, which are unable to meet the AI specifications without additional redesigning and optimization efforts. In this letter, we propose an automated framework for AI-rooted IoT system design approach, where the AI specifications play a vital role in deciding the system components, design, and implementation from a very early stage of the design life cycle. The proposed framework employs an expert system and a machine-readable knowledge-base to automate the design process. Using a set of case studies, we demonstrate the benefits of the proposed framework.

AB Partial atomic charge assignment is of immense practical value to force field parametrization, molecular docking, and cheminformatics. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling chemistry at unprecedented computational speeds given accurate reference data. However, certain tasks, such as charge assignment, do not have a unique solution. Herein, we use a machine learning algorithm to discover a new charge assignment model by learning to replicate molecular dipole moments across a large, diverse set of nonequilibrium conformations of molecules containing C, H, N, and O atoms. The new model, called Affordable Charge Assignment (ACA), is computationally inexpensive and predicts dipoles of out-of-sample molecules accurately. Furthermore, dipole-inferred ACA charges are transferable to dipole and even quadrupole moments of much larger molecules than those used for training. We apply ACA to dynamical trajectories of biomolecules and produce their infrared spectra. Additionally, we find that ACA assigns similar charges to Charge Model 5 but with greatly reduced computational cost.

AB Building a scalable machine learning system for unsupervised anomaly detection via representation learning is highly desirable. One of the prevalent methods is using a reconstruction error of variational autoencoder (VAE) by maximizing the evidence lower bound. We revisit VAE from the perspective of information theory to provide some theoretical foundations on using the reconstruction error and finally arrive at a simpler yet effective model for anomaly detection. In addition, to enhance the effectiveness of detecting anomalies, we incorporate a practical model uncertainty measure into the anomaly score. We show empirically the competitive performance of our approach on benchmark data sets.

ID JUDGMENT COMPETENCE
AB Objectives Artificial intelligence tools such as Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) have been used for many health care-related applications; however, there is a lack of research on their capabilities for evaluating morally and/or ethically complex medical decisions. The objective of this study was to assess the moral competence of ChatGPT.Materials and methods This cross-sectional study was performed between May 2023 and July 2023 using scenarios from the Moral Competence Test (MCT). Numerical responses were collected from ChatGPT 3.5 and 4.0 to assess individual and overall stage scores, including C-index and overall moral stage preference. Descriptive analysis and 2-sided Student's t-test were used for all continuous data.Results A total of 100 iterations of the MCT were performed and moral preference was found to be higher in the latter Kohlberg-derived arguments. ChatGPT 4.0 was found to have a higher overall moral stage preference (2.325 versus 1.755) when compared to ChatGPT 3.5. ChatGPT 4.0 was also found to have a statistically higher C-index score in comparison to ChatGPT 3.5 (29.03 +/- 11.10 versus 19.32 +/- 10.95, P =.0000275).Discussion ChatGPT 3.5 and 4.0 trended towards higher moral preference for the latter stages of Kohlberg's theory for both dilemmas with C-indices suggesting medium moral competence. However, both models showed moderate variation in C-index scores indicating inconsistency and further training is recommended.Conclusion ChatGPT demonstrates medium moral competence and can evaluate arguments based on Kohlberg's theory of moral development. These findings suggest that future revisions of ChatGPT and other large language models could assist physicians in the decision-making process when encountering complex ethical scenarios.
   In this cross-sectional study, when provided with health care and non-health care scenarios from the Moral Competence Test, ChatGPT 4.0 outperformed ChatGPT 3.5 in both scenarios in terms of moral competence and overall moral stage preference, suggesting medium moral competence. Both models showed moderate variability despite no changes to the prompts, suggesting inconsistency and the need for in-house training. Future developments of large language models have the potential to assist physicians in the decision-making process when encountering a difficult ethical decision.

AB Help-seeking is a valuable practice in online discussion forums. However, the asynchronicity and information overload of online discussion forums have made it challenging for help seekers and providers to connect effectively. This study formulated a new method to provide fair and accurate insights toward building a peer recommender to support help-seeking in online learning. Specifically, we developed the fair network embedding (Fair-NE) model and compared it with existing popular models. We trained and evaluated the models with a large dataset consisting of 187,450 discussion post-reply pairs by 10,182 Algebra I online learners from 2015 to 2020. Finally, we examined models with representation fairness, predictive accuracy, and predictive fairness. The results showed that the Fair-NE can achieve superior fairness in genders and races while retaining competitive predictive accuracy. This study marks a paradigm change from previous investigation and evaluation of fair artificial intelligence to proactively build fair artificial intelligence in education.

AB Applications of Machine learning (ML) in health informatics have gained increasing attention. The timely diagnosis of kidney disease and the subsequent immediate response to it are of the cases that shed light on the substantial role of ML diagnostic algorithms. ML in Kidney Disease Diagnosis (MLKDD) is an active research topic that aims at assisting physicians with computer-aided systems. Various investigations have tried to test the feasibility, applicability, and superiority of different ML methods over each other. However, lacking a holistic survey for this literature has always been a noticeable shortcoming. Hence, this paper provides a comprehensive literature review of ML utilizations in kidney disease diagnosis by introducing two different frameworks, one for MLs, classifying various aspects of kidney disease diagnosis, and the other is the framework of medical sub-fields related to MLKDD. In addition, research gaps are discovered, and future study directions are discussed.

AB We present the Cosmology and Astrophysics with Machine Learning Simulations (CAMELS) Multifield Data set (CMD), a collection of hundreds of thousands of 2D maps and 3D grids containing many different properties of cosmic gas, dark matter, and stars from more than 2000 distinct simulated universes at several cosmic times. The 2D maps and 3D grids represent cosmic regions that span similar to 100 million light-years and have been generated from thousands of state-of-the-art hydrodynamic and gravity-only N-body simulations from the CAMELS project. Designed to train machine-learning models, CMD is the largest data set of its kind containing more than 70 TB of data. In this paper we describe CMD in detail and outline a few of its applications. We focus our attention on one such task, parameter inference, formulating the problems we face as a challenge to the community. We release all data and provide further technical details at https://camels-multifield-dataset.readthedocs.io.

AB A general social learning theory of deviance is applied to adolescent smoking as a form of sustance use and tested with data from a 5-year longitudinal study of a panel (N=454) of respondents in grades 7 through 12 in an lowa community. The major components of the process specified in the theory are differential association, differential reinforcement, definitions (attitudes), and modeling. The process is one in which the operation of these variables produces abstinence or smoking, but with some reciprocal effects of smoking behavior on the social learning variables. Previous research on various kinds of deviance and substance use has been supportive of the theory. The findings in this study from LISREL models of the overall social learning process and each of the component of association, reinforcement, and definitions are also supportive.

AB Great potential exists for future Brain Machine Interfaces (BMIs) to help paralyzed patients, and others with motor disabilities, regain (artificial) motor control and autonomy. This paper describes a novel approach towards the development of new design architectures and research test-beds for advanced BMIs. It addresses a critical design challenge in deriving the functional mapping between the subject's movement intent and actuated behavior. Currently, adaptive signal processing techniques are used to correlate neuronal modulation with known movements generated by the subject. However, with patients who are paralyzed, access to the individual's movement is unavailable. Inspired by motor control research, this paper considers a predictive framework for BMI using multiple adaptive models trained with supervised or reinforcement learning in a closed-loop architecture that requires real-time feedback. Here, movement trajectories can be inferred and incrementally updated using instantaneous knowledge of the movement target and the individual's current neuronal activation. In this framework, BMIs require a computing infrastructure capable of selectively executing multiple models on the basis of signals received by and/or provided to the brain in real time. Middleware currently under investigation to provide this data-driven dynamic capability is discussed.

AB Hydrological streamline delineation is critical for effective environmental management, influencing agriculture sustainability, river dynamics, watershed planning, and more. This study develops a novel approach to combining transfer learning with convolutional neural networks that capitalize on ImageNet pre-trained models to improve the accuracy and transferability of streamline delineation. We evaluate the performance of eleven ImageNet pre-trained models and a baseline model using datasets from Rowan County, NC, and Covington River, VA in the USA. Our results demonstrate that when models are adapted to a new area, the fine-tuned ImageNet pre-trained model exhibits superior predictive accuracy, markedly higher than the models trained from scratch or those only fine-tuned on the same area. Moreover, the ImageNet model achieves better smoothness and connectivity between classified streamline channels. These findings underline the effectiveness of transfer learning in enhancing the delineation of hydrological streamlines across varied geographies, offering a scalable solution for accurate and efficient environmental modelling.

ID EXTREME LEARNING-MACHINE
AB This paper surveys in a tutorial fashion the recent history of universal learning machines starting with the multilayer perceptron. The big push in recent years has been on the design of universal learning machines using optimization methods linear in the parameters, such as the Echo State Network, the Extreme Learning Machine and the Kernel Adaptive filter. We call this class of learning machines convex universal learning machines or CULMs. The purpose of the paper is to compare the methods behind these CULMs, highlighting their features using concepts of vector spaces (i.e. basis functions and projections), which are easy to understand by the computational intelligence community. We illustrate how two of the CULMs behave in a simple example, and we conclude that indeed it is practical to create universal mappers with convex adaptation, which is an improvement over backpropagation.

DE Point cloud analysis; Dynamic graph neural networks; Geometric

AB This paper proposes geometric attentional dynamic graph convolutional neural networks for point cloud analysis. The core operation is a geometric attentional edge convolution module which extends classic CNN to extract both extrinsic and intrinsic properties of point clouds for a rich representation learning of point features. The relations in geometric space regarding the extrinsic geometric topological prior are modeled as geometric attention and incorporated in the EdgeConv of DGCNN which captures the intrinsic feature likelihood of point clouds. Therefore, the proposed geometric attentional edge convolution is able to learn point cloud representations from both intrinsic and extrinsic properties. To form a hierarchical architecture to capture rich information of point clouds from these two kinds of underlying properties, two graphs are dynamic constructed in the geometric and feature space respectively layer by layer. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks for various point cloud analysis tasks, including shape classification, share retrieval, normal estimation, shape part segmentation, have verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB Machine learning (ML) can aid in novel discoveries in the field of viral gene therapy. Specifically, big data gathered through next-generation sequencing (NGS) of complex capsid libraries is an especially prominent source of lost potential in data analysis and prediction. Furthermore, adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based capsid libraries are becoming increasingly popular as a tool to select candidates for gene therapy vectors. These higher complexity AAV capsid libraries have previously been created and selected in vivo; however, in silico analysis using ML computer algorithms may augment smarter and more robust libraries for selection. In this study, data of AAV capsid libraries gathered before and after viral assembly are used to train ML algorithms. We found that two ML computer algorithms, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and support vector machines (SVMs), can be trained to predict whether unknown capsid variants may assemble into viable virus-like structures. Using the most accurate models constructed, hypothetical mutation patterns in library construction were simulated to suggest the importance of N495, G546, and I554 in AAV2-derived capsids. Finally, two comparative libraries were generated using ML-derived data to biologically validate these findings and demonstrate the predictive power of ML in vector design.

AB Simple Summary Performing a mitosis count (MC) is essential in grading canine Soft Tissue Sarcoma (cSTS) and canine Perivascular Wall Tumours (cPWTs), although it is subject to inter- and intra-observer variability. To enhance standardisation, an artificial intelligence mitosis detection approach was investigated. A two-step annotation process was utilised with a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model, refined through veterinary pathologists' reviews of false positives, and subsequently optimised using an F1-score thresholding method to maximise accuracy measures. The study achieved a best F1-score of 0.75, demonstrating competitiveness in the field of canine mitosis detection.Abstract Performing a mitosis count (MC) is the diagnostic task of histologically grading canine Soft Tissue Sarcoma (cSTS). However, mitosis count is subject to inter- and intra-observer variability. Deep learning models can offer a standardisation in the process of MC used to histologically grade canine Soft Tissue Sarcomas. Subsequently, the focus of this study was mitosis detection in canine Perivascular Wall Tumours (cPWTs). Generating mitosis annotations is a long and arduous process open to inter-observer variability. Therefore, by keeping pathologists in the loop, a two-step annotation process was performed where a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model was trained on initial annotations provided by veterinary pathologists. The pathologists reviewed the output false positive mitosis candidates and determined whether these were overlooked candidates, thus updating the dataset. Faster R-CNN was then trained on this updated dataset. An optimal decision threshold was applied to maximise the F1-score predetermined using the validation set and produced our best F1-score of 0.75, which is competitive with the state of the art in the canine mitosis domain.

TI Detection of Necrosis in Digitised Whole-Slide Images for Better Grading
   of Canine Soft-Tissue Sarcomas Using Machine-Learning

AB Simple Summary Canine soft-tissue sarcomas are a group of tumours that arise from the skin and subcutaneous connective tissue. The most common method used to predict the behaviour of these tumours is grading. The grading system used for soft-tissue sarcomas is derived from a combined score calculated by evaluating the mitotic count, percentage of tumour necrosis and degree of cellular differentiation. However, these parameters are highly subjective and a high inter-observer variability has been reported in grading these tumours, which can result in complications regarding treatment plans. Manual identification of areas of necrosis is a time-consuming task that is prone to observer error. Artificial-intelligence algorithms and, in particular, machine learning, can help improve grading by automatically detecting regions of necrosis. The aim of this study was to differentiate image regions in order to automatically identify tumour necrosis in digitised canine soft-tissue sarcoma slides. This method showed an accuracy of 92.7% which represents the number of correctly classified data instances over the total number of data instances. Therefore, the proposed method is a promising tool to minimise human error in the evaluation of necrosis in soft-tissue sarcomas, and hence increase the efficiency and accuracy of histopathological grading of canine soft-tissue sarcomas. The definitive diagnosis of canine soft-tissue sarcomas (STSs) is based on histological assessment of formalin-fixed tissues. Assessment of parameters, such as degree of differentiation, necrosis score and mitotic score, give rise to a final tumour grade, which is important in determining prognosis and subsequent treatment modalities. However, grading discrepancies are reported to occur in human and canine STSs, which can result in complications regarding treatment plans. The introduction of digital pathology has the potential to help improve STS grading via automated determination of the presence and extent of necrosis. The detected necrotic regions can be factored in the grading scheme or excluded before analysing the remaining tissue. Here we describe a method to detect tumour necrosis in histopathological whole-slide images (WSIs) of STSs using machine learning. Annotated areas of necrosis were extracted from WSIs and the patches containing necrotic tissue fed into a pre-trained DenseNet161 convolutional neural network (CNN) for training, testing and validation. The proposed CNN architecture reported favourable results, with an overall validation accuracy of 92.7% for necrosis detection which represents the number of correctly classified data instances over the total number of data instances. The proposed method, when vigorously validated represents a promising tool to assist pathologists in evaluating necrosis in canine STS tumours, by increasing efficiency, accuracy and reducing inter-rater variation.

AB The number of published Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) has increased significantly in recent years. These new data-driven potential energy approximations often lack the physics-based foundations that inform many traditionally-developed interatomic potentials and hence require robust validation methods for their accuracy, computational efficiency, and applicability to the intended applications. This work presents a sequential, three-stage workflow for MLIP validation: (i) preliminary validation, (ii) static property prediction, and (iii) dynamic property prediction. This material-agnostic procedure is demonstrated in a tutorial approach for the development of a robust MLIP for boron carbide (B4C), a widely employed, structurally complex ceramic that undergoes a deleterious deformation mechanism called 'amorphization' under high-pressure loading. It is shown that the resulting B4C MLIP offers a more accurate prediction of properties compared to the available empirical potential.

AB Recent studies have significantly improved the prediction accuracy of travel demand using graph neural networks. However, these studies largely ignored uncertainty that inevitably exists in travel demand prediction. To fill this gap, this study proposes a framework of probabilistic graph neural networks (Prob-GNN) to quantify the spatiotemporal uncertainty of travel demand. This Prob-GNN framework is substantiated by deterministic and probabilistic assumptions, and empirically applied to the task of predicting the transit and ridesharing demand in Chicago. We found that the probabilistic assumptions (e.g. distribution tail, support) have a greater impact on uncertainty prediction than the deterministic ones (e.g. deep modules, depth). Among the family of Prob-GNNs, the GNNs with truncated Gaussian and Laplace distributions achieve the highest performance in transit and ridesharing data. Even under significant domain shifts, Prob-GNNs can predict the ridership uncertainty in a stable manner, when the models are trained on pre-COVID data and tested across multiple periods during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Prob-GNNs also reveal the spatiotemporal pattern of uncertainty, which is concentrated on the afternoon peak hours and the areas with large travel volumes. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of incorporating randomness into deep learning for spatiotemporal ridership prediction. Future research should continue to investigate versatile probabilistic assumptions to capture behavioral randomness, and further develop methods to quantify uncertainty to build resilient cities.

However, several unanswered questions persist regarding the potential impacts of AI on urban and regional planning research and practice, as well as the issues involved and the appropriate responses and plans. This paper aims to address these concerns in the AI-enabled planning process and accordingly create a typology of urban planning AI to categorize and outline the progression of AI in urban planning, ranging from AI-assisted and AI-augmented planning to AI-automated and eventually AI-autonomized planning, based on a scoping literature review.

AB We focus on minimizing nonconvex finite-sum functions that typically arise in machine learning problems. In an attempt to solve this problem, the adaptive cubic-regularized Newton method has shown its strong global convergence guarantees and the ability to escape from strict saddle points. In this paper, we expand this algorithm to incorporating the negative curvature method to update even at unsuccessful iterations. We call this new method Stochastic Adaptive cubic regularization with Negative Curvature (SANC). Unlike the previous method, in order to attain stochastic gradient and Hessian estimators, the SANC algorithm uses independent sets of data points of consistent size over all iterations. It makes the SANC algorithm more practical to apply for solving large-scale machine learning problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that combines the negative curvature method with the adaptive cubic-regularized Newton method. Finally, we provide experimental results, including neural networks problems supporting the efficiency of our method.

ID NEURAL-NETWORKS; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION; ROBOT
AB Weeds are a significant threat to agricultural productivity and the environment. The increasing demand for sustainable weed control practices has driven innovative developments in alternative weed control technologies aimed at reducing the reliance on herbicides. The barrier to adoption of these technologies for selective in-crop use is availability of suitably effective weed recognition. With the great success of deep learning in various vision tasks, many promising image-based weed detection algorithms have been developed. This paper reviews recent developments of deep learning techniques in the field of image-based weed detection. The review begins with an introduction to the fundamentals of deep learning related to weed detection. Next, recent advancements in deep weed detection are reviewed with the discussion of the research materials including public weed datasets. Finally, the challenges of developing practically deployable weed detection methods are summarized, together with the discussions of the opportunities for future research. We hope that this review will provide a timely survey of the field and attract more researchers to address this inter-disciplinary research problem.

AB Reinforcement learning (RL)-based online approximate optimal control methods applied to deterministic systems typically require a restrictive persistence of excitation (PE) condition for convergence. This paper develops a concurrent learning (CL)-based implementation of model-based RL to solve approximate optimal regulation problems online under a PE-like rank condition. The development is based on the observation that, given a model of the system, RL can be implemented by evaluating the Bellman error at any number of desired points in the state space. In this result, a parametric system model is considered, and a CL-based parameter identifier is developed to compensate for uncertainty in the parameters. Uniformly ultimately bounded regulation of the system states to a neighborhood of the origin, and convergence of the developed policy to a neighborhood of the optimal policy are established using a Lyapunov-based analysis, and simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the developed controller.

ID ACTION RECOGNITION; MANIFOLD
AB Reinforcement learning in large-scale environments is challenging due to the many possible actions that can be taken in specific situations. We have previously developed a means of constraining, and hence speeding up, the search process through the use of motion primitives; motion primitives are sequences of pre-specified actions taken across a state series. As a byproduct of this work, we have found that if the motion primitives' motions and actions are labeled, then the search can be sped up further. Since motion primitives may initially lack such details, we propose a theoretically viewpoint-insensitive and speed-insensitive means of automatically annotating the underlying motions and actions. We do this through a differential-geometric, spatio-temporal kinematics descriptor, which analyzes how the poses of entities in two motion sequences change over time. We use this descriptor in conjunction with a weighted-nearest-neighbor classifier to label the primitives using a limited set of training examples. In our experiments, we achieve high motion and action annotation rates for human-action-derived primitives with as few as one training sample. We also demonstrate that reinforcement learning using accurately labeled trajectories leads to high-performing policies more quickly than standard reinforcement learning techniques. This is partly because motion primitives encode prior domain knowledge and preempt the need to re-discover that knowledge during training. It is also because agents can leverage the labels to systematically ignore action classes that do not facilitate task objectives, thereby reducing the action space.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) offers potential solutions to optimize agricultural production and sustainability. This study examined American perceptions and attitudes toward AI applications in the food and agriculture systems, assessing both public optimism and concerns. Using a mixed-methods approach grounded in online ethnography and survey analysis, we identified five primary themes influencing public support for AI in agriculture: Knowledge of AI in agriculture, trust in scientific experts in agriculture and food production, concerns about using AI in agriculture, health concerns about agriculture and food production, and general attitudes toward AI technology itself. Findings indicated moderate public knowledge about AI's agricultural applications, with higher support correlating with trust in agricultural scientists and awareness of health benefits linked to AI innovations. Conversely, concerns over privacy, data security, and potential job displacement contribute to hesitancy. Our regression model further highlights the significance of these themes with demographic factors. This study indicated the need for AI stakeholders to address knowledge gaps and ethical considerations, emphasizing transparent data practices and clear communication of AI in enhancing agricultural sustainability. These insights offer valuable directions for future research and policy-making, promoting a balanced approach to integrating AI in agriculture that is responsive to public sentiment and ethical standards.

AB Insects have an important degree of collaboration for the maintenance of the ecosystem on the planet. However, after reaching a certain population level and causing damage to plants, some insects are considered as pests and represent a threat to agriculture. Aphids insects that has characteristics to reach this state as it has a high biotic potential and can cause different types of damage to plants. Climatic data as precipitation, winds and temperatures affect the population quantity of these insects. Therefore, this work proposes to apply different machine learning techniques with the objective to verify the existing correlation between climatic variables and the population dynamics of aphids. It can be concluded that variables such as precipitation, temperature, number of days when it rains in the week and climatic phenomena such as El nino and La nina have an influence on the aphid population. During the work, four models were developed in order to predict the population of these insects. The accuracy of the prediction model developed were 11.4% for Linear Regression; 26.4% for the Artificial Neural Network model; 29.3% for Decision Tree and 41.4% for Random Forest.

AB Mapping of wetlands (marsh vs. swamp vs. upland) is a common remote sensing application. Yet, discriminating between similar freshwater communities such as graminoid/sedge from remotely sensed imagery is more difficult. Most of this activity has been performed using medium to low resolution imagery. There are only a few studies using high spatial resolution imagery and machine learning image classification algorithms for mapping heterogeneous wetland plant communities. This study addresses this void by analyzing whether machine learning classifiers such as decision trees (DT) and artificial neural networks (ANN) can accurately classify graminoid/sedge communities using high resolution aerial imagery and image texture data in the Everglades National Park, Florida. In addition to spectral bands, the normalized difference vegetation index, and first-and second-order texture features derived from the near-infrared band were analyzed. Classifier accuracies were assessed using confusion tables and the calculated kappa coefficients of the resulting maps. The results indicated that an ANN (multilayer perceptron based on back propagation) algorithm produced a statistically significantly higher accuracy (82.04 %) than the DT (QUEST) algorithm (80.48 %) or the maximum likelihood (80.56 %) classifier (alpha<0.05). Findings show that using multiple window sizes provided the best results. First-order texture features also provided computational advantages and results that were not significantly different from those using second-order texture features.

AB With the development of cloud computing and big data, the internal communication business in data center has increased dramatically, and then the traffic in data center has also significantly increased. The bandwidth of data center is difficult to meet the bandwidth requirements of those intensive applications, and data center is facing a risk of network congestion. Under the background of the development of network intelligence, software-defined network (SDN) should demonstrate its intelligence as a future network architecture. In this paper, we introduce reinforcement learning into the SDN data center to implement congestion control based on flow. We improve the Q-learning and Sarsa algorithms and propose two methods of congestion control based on the algorithms. Test results show that these two congestion control methods can control congestion effectively. And Sarsa method has a better performance of link utilization. The average link utilization of the Sarsa method is 2.4% higher than the Q-learning method and is 4.48% higher than the on-demand method.

AB Background: The implementation of large language models (LLMs), such as BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) and GPT-4, has revolutionized the extraction of insights from unstructured text. These advancements have expanded into health care, allowing analysis of social media for public health insights. However, the detection of drug discontinuation events (DDEs) remains underexplored. Identifying DDEs is crucial for understanding medication adherence and patient outcomes. Objective: The aim of this study is to provide a flexible framework for investigating various clinical research questions in data-sparse environments. We provide an example of the utility of this framework by identifying DDEs and their root causes in an open-source web-based forum, MedHelp, and by releasing the first open-source DDE datasets to aid further research in this domain. Representations from Transformer with Disentangled Attention), and BART, among others, to detect and determine the root causes of DDEs in user comments posted on MedHelp. Our study design included the use of zero-shot classification, which allows these models to make predictions without task-specific training. We split user comments into sentences and applied different classification strategies to assess the performance of these models in identifying DDEs and their root causes. Results: Among the selected models, GPT-4o performed the best at determining the root causes of DDEs, predicting only 12.9% of root causes incorrectly (hamming loss). Among the open-source models tested, BART demonstrated the best performance in detecting DDEs, achieving an F1-score of 0.86, a false positive rate of 2.8%, and a false negative rate of 6.5%, all without any fine-tuning. The dataset included 10.7% (107/1000) DDEs, emphasizing the models' robustness in an imbalanced data context. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the effectiveness of open- and closed-source LLMs, such as GPT-4o and BART, for detecting DDEs and their root causes from publicly accessible data through zero-shot classification. The robust and scalable framework we propose can aid researchers in addressing data-sparse clinical research questions. The launch of open-access DDE datasets has the potential to stimulate further research and novel discoveries in this field.

AB An explainable artificial intelligence approach based on consolidating the Local Interpretable and Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME) mod& outputs was devised to discern the influence of the surface morphology on the colors exhibited by stainless-steel 304 parts polished with a Magnetic Abrasive Finishing (MAF) process. The MAF polishing process was used to create two regions, each appearing either blue or red to the naked eye. The color distribution was microscopically heterogeneous, i.e., some red microscale patches were dispersed in blue regions, and vice versa. The surface morphology was represented in the frequency domain (using a 2D Fourier transform) to capture the harmonic surface patterns, such as the feed and lay marks from the polishing process. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was employed to identify the color of the region from the frequency characteristics of the surface morphology. The CNN was able to predict the observed colors with test accuracies exceeding 99%, suggesting that the frequency characteristics of the surface morphology of the red regions are distinctly different from those of the blue regions. A LIME model was constructed around each small segment within each region of the surface to identify the frequency features that are influential for differentiating between the colors. To deal with the effect of heterogeneity, an algorithm based on the query by experts was used to reconcile the local influences and gather the global explanations of the frequency characteristics that inform the blue versus red regions. We found that the dominant morphological features in the red regions are those that capture the polishing lay patterns underlying surface structure, whereas those in the blue regions capture the non-uniform and high-frequency waveform patterns, such as those result when oxide films form due to the intense polishing conditions.

AB Analyzing deep neural networks (DNNs) via information plane (IP) theory has gained tremendous attention recently to gain insight into, among others, DNNs' generalization ability. However, it is by no means obvious how to estimate the mutual information (MI) between each hidden layer and the input/desired output to construct the IP. For instance, hidden layers with many neurons require MI estimators with robustness toward the high dimensionality associated with such layers. MI estimators should also be able to handle convolutional layers while at the same time being computationally tractable to scale to large networks. Existing IP methods have not been able to study truly deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We propose an IP analysis using the new matrix-based Renyi's entropy coupled with tensor kernels, leveraging the power of kernel methods to represent properties of the probability distribution independently of the dimensionality of the data. Our results shed new light on previous studies concerning small-scale DNNs using a completely new approach. We provide a comprehensive IP analysis of large-scale CNNs, investigating the different training phases and providing new insights into the training dynamics of large-scale neural networks.

AB The 2023 Joint Annual Congress of the International Liver Transplantation Society, European Liver and Intestine Transplant Association, and Liver Intensive Care Group of Europe were held in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, from May 3 to 6, 2023. This year, all speakers were invited to attend the Congress in person for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic. The congress was attended by 1159 registered delegates from 54 countries representing 5 continents, with the 10 countries comprising the bulk of the delegates. Of the 647 abstracts initially submitted, 542 were eventually presented at the meeting, coming from 38 countries (mainly North America, Europe, and Asia) and 85% of them (462 abstracts) came from only 10 countries. Fifty-three (9.8%) abstracts, originated from 17 countries, were submitted under the Basic/Translational Scientific Research category, a similar percentage as in 2022. Abstracts presented at the meeting were classified as (1) ischemia and reperfusion injury, (2) machine perfusion, (3) bioengineering and liver regeneration, (4) transplant oncology, (5) novel biomarkers in liver transplantation, (6) liver immunology (rejection and tolerance), and (7) artificial intelligence and machine learning. Finally, we evaluated the number of abstracts commented in the Basic and Translational Research Committee-International Liver Transplantation Society annual reports over the past 5 y that resulted in publications in peer-reviewed journals to measure their scientific impact in the field of liver transplantation.

AB Remote sensing technology is vital for precision agriculture, aiding in early issue detection, resource management, and environmentally friendly practices. Recent advances in remote sensing technology and data processing have propelled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into valuable tools for obtaining detailed data on plant diseases with high spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution. Given the growing body of scholarly research centered on UAV-based disease detection, a comprehensive review and analysis of current studies becomes imperative to provide a panoramic view of evolving methodologies in plant disease monitoring and to strategically evaluate the potential and limitations of such strategies. This study undertakes a systematic quantitative literature review to summarize existing literature and discern current research trends in UAV-based applications for plant disease detection and monitoring. Results reveal a global disparity in research on the topic, with Asian countries being the top contributing countries (43 out of 103 papers). World regions such as Oceania and Africa exhibit comparatively lesser representation. To date, research has largely focused on diseases affecting wheat, sugar beet, potato, maize, and grapevine. Multispectral, reg-green-blue, and hyperspectral sensors were most often used to detect and identify disease symptoms, with current trends pointing to approaches integrating multiple sensors and the use of machine learning and deep learning techniques. Future research should prioritize (i) development of cost-effective and user-friendly UAVs, (ii) integration with emerging agricultural technologies, (iii) improved data acquisition and processing efficiency (iv) diverse testing scenarios, and (v) ethical considerations through proper regulations.

AB AimThe aim of this study was to evaluate and compare artificial intelligence (AI)-based large language models (LLMs) (ChatGPT-3.5, Bing, and Bard) with human-based formulations in generating relevant clinical queries, using comprehensive methodological evaluations.MethodsTo interact with the major LLMs ChatGPT-3.5, Bing Chat, and Google Bard, scripts and prompts were designed to formulate PICOT (population, intervention, comparison, outcome, time) clinical questions and search strategies. Quality of the LLMs responses was assessed using a descriptive approach and independent assessment by two researchers. To determine the number of hits, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL Ultimate search results were imported separately, without search restrictions, with the search strings generated by the three LLMs and an additional one by the expert. Hits from one of the scenarios were also exported for relevance evaluation. The use of a single scenario was chosen to provide a focused analysis. Cronbach's alpha and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were also calculated.ResultsIn five different scenarios, ChatGPT-3.5 generated 11,859 hits, Bing 1,376,854, Bard 16,583, and an expert 5919 hits. We then used the first scenario to assess the relevance of the obtained results. The human expert search approach resulted in 65.22% (56/105) relevant articles. Bing was the most accurate AI-based LLM with 70.79% (63/89), followed by ChatGPT-3.5 with 21.05% (12/45), and Bard with 13.29% (42/316) relevant hits. Based on the assessment of two evaluators, ChatGPT-3.5 received the highest score (M = 48.50; SD = 0.71). Results showed a high level of agreement between the two evaluators. Although ChatGPT-3.5 showed a lower percentage of relevant hits compared to Bing, this reflects the nuanced evaluation criteria, where the subjective evaluation prioritized contextual accuracy and quality over mere relevance.ConclusionThis study provides valuable insights into the ability of LLMs to formulate PICOT clinical questions and search strategies. AI-based LLMs, such as ChatGPT-3.5, demonstrate significant potential for augmenting clinical workflows, improving clinical query development, and supporting search strategies. However, the findings also highlight limitations that necessitate further refinement and continued human oversight.Clinical RelevanceAI could assist nurses in formulating PICOT clinical questions and search strategies. AI-based LLMs offer valuable support to healthcare professionals by improving the structure of clinical questions and enhancing search strategies, thereby significantly increasing the efficiency of information retrieval.

AB Remote sensing and machine learning (ML) could assist and support growers, stakeholders, and plant pathologists determine plant diseases resulting from viral, bacterial, and fungal infections. Spectral vegetation indices (VIs) have shown to be helpful for the indirect detection of plant diseases. The purpose of this study was to utilize ML models and identify VIs for the detection of downy mildew (DM) disease in watermelon in several disease severity (DS) stages, including low, medium (levels 1 and 2), high, and very high. Hyperspectral images of leaves were collected in the laboratory by a benchtop system (380-1,000 nm) and in the field by a UAV-based imaging system (380-1,000 nm). Two classification methods, multilayer perceptron (MLP) and decision tree (DT), were implemented to distinguish between healthy and DM-affected plants. The best classification rates were recorded by the MLP method; however, only 62.3% accuracy was observed at low disease severity. The classification accuracy increased when the disease severity increased (e.g., 86-90% for the laboratory analysis and 69-91% for the field analysis). The best wavelengths to differentiate between the DS stages were selected in the band of 531 nm, and 700-900 nm. The most significant VIs for DS detection were the chlorophyll green (Cl green), photochemical reflectance index (PRI), normalized phaeophytinization index (NPQI) for laboratory analysis, and the ratio analysis of reflectance spectral chlorophyll-a, b, and c (RARSa, RASRb, and RARSc) and the Cl green in the field analysis. Spectral VIs and ML could enhance disease detection and monitoring for precision agriculture applications.

AB It is well known that accurate and reliable maintenance and repair cost estimates are important to maintain a building in its optimal condition, especially during the operation and maintenance phase within the whole life cycle. However, due to emerging trends in buildings that are high-performance, large-scale, complex, and high-rise, it is difficult to achieve those cost estimates. In addition, the impact of climate changes that tend to occur more frequent and severe natural disasters has caused increasing damages to buildings, yet little is still specifically known about predicting the impact of natural disasters on repair costs of accommodation facilities accurately and reliably. This study fills this gap by developing and validating a deep neural network (DNN) model that can generalize repair cost trends associated with natural disaster factors, including peak ground acceleration, precipitation, wind speed, geographic profiles of adjacent water systems, drawing on 1125 insurance claim payout records on accommodation facilities. The robustness of the developed DNN model was scientifically tested and validated using the root mean squared error and the mean absolute error methods. Practical applicability of the proposed modeling framework was then demonstrated by creating predicted repair cost trends. This study contributes to the existing knowledge by proposing a deep learning method that predicts repair costs of accommodation facilities associated with natural disasters, while providing both facility managers and insurance companies with evidence-based reference to develop better-informed cost management strategies against potential natural disasters.

ID MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH; MODEL
AB This article deals with approximating steady-state particle-resolved fluid flow around a fixed particle of interest under the influence of randomly distributed stationary particles in a dispersed multiphase setup using convolutional neural network (CNN). The considered problem involves rotational symmetry about the mean velocity (streamwise) direction. Thus, this work enforces this symmetry using SE(3)-equivariant, special Euclidean group of dimension 3, CNN architecture, which is translation and three-dimensional rotation equivariant. This study mainly explores the generalization capabilities and benefits of a SE(3)-equivariant network. Accurate synthetic flow fields for Reynolds number and particle volume fraction combinations spanning over a range of [86.22, 172.96] and [0.11, 0.45], respectively, are produced with careful application of symmetry-aware data-driven approach.</p>

AB Setting up workable budgets symbolizes the competence of state highway agencies (SHAs) in fulfilling their responsibilities, and unreliable cost estimates can cause economic and political complications. The unclear scope definition and scarcity of project information available at early stages make it hard to generate reliable preliminary estimates. Hence, based on the 1,249 projects retrieved from the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) database, this research aimed to develop a cost estimation model using statistical learning methods for SHAs to forecast preliminary costs during the early stages of a transportation project to fulfill different cost control and managerial functions. However, the currently used methods have serious limitations. This study introduced alternative statistical learning approaches to the currently most used methods: least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and general regression neural network (GRNN). LASSO regression, for instance, has proved in other areas of science to be remarkably better in terms of variable selection, interpretability, and numerical stability. In addition, this study also accounted for economic factors in model development because economic conditions are influential on highway construction costs but have received limited attention. Using the same dataset, LASSO and GRNN models were developed, and then their performances were evaluated based on a set of criteria, e.g., the mean absolute error and mean absolute percentage error. In comparison to the current practice with state DOTs, this research contributes to the body of knowledge by introducing a series of objective modeling approaches that can prevent human errors, requiring no substantial experience in preliminary estimating. Besides the introduction of statistical learning methods, this study took economic indicators into account when developing the models because they are important factors but have been ignored in previous studies. In addition, these statistical learning methods can produce reliable estimates in a much faster and more consistent fashion, which is critical, particularly considering the massive workload faced by most SHAs and the allowable time to make a preliminary estimate.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are poised to become an increasingly important part of education in the anatomical sciences. OpenAI has also introduced generative pretrained transformers (GPTs), which are customizable versions of the standard ChatGPT application. There is little research that has explored the potential of GPTs to serve as intelligent tutoring systems for learning the anatomical sciences. The objective of this study was to describe the design and explore the performance of AnatomyGPT, a customized artificial intelligence application intended for anatomical sciences education. The AnatomyGPT application was configured with GPT Builder by uploading open-source textbooks as knowledge sources and by providing pedagogical instructions for how to interact with users. The performance of AnatomyGPT was compared with ChatGPT by evaluating the responses of both applications to prompts of the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) sample items with respect to accuracy, rationales, and citations. AnatomyGPT achieved high scores on the NBME sample items for Gross Anatomy, Embryology, Histology, and Neuroscience and scored comparably to ChatGPT. In addition, AnatomyGPT provided several citations in the responses that it generated, while ChatGPT provided none. Both GPTs provided rationales for all sample items. The customized AnatomyGPT application demonstrated preliminary potential as an intelligent tutoring system by generating responses with increased citations as compared with the standard ChatGPT application. The findings of this study suggest that instructors and students may wish to create their own custom GPTs for teaching and learning anatomy. Future research is needed to further develop and characterize the potential of GPTs for anatomy education.

AB Introduction Automatic recognition of stutters (ARS) from speech recordings can facilitate objective assessment and intervention for people who stutter. However, the performance of ARS systems may depend on how the speech data are segmented and labelled for training and testing. This study compared two segmentation methods: event-based, which delimits speech segments by their fluency status, and interval-based, which uses fixed-length segments regardless of fluency.Methods Machine learning models were trained and evaluated on interval-based and event-based stuttered speech corpora. The models used acoustic and linguistic features extracted from the speech signal and the transcriptions generated by a state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition system.Results The results showed that event-based segmentation led to better ARS performance than interval-based segmentation, as measured by the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic. The results suggest differences in the quality and quantity of the data because of segmentation method. The inclusion of linguistic features improved the detection of whole-word repetitions, but not other types of stutters.Discussion The findings suggest that event-based segmentation is more suitable for ARS than interval-based segmentation, as it preserves the exact boundaries and types of stutters. The linguistic features provide useful information for separating supra-lexical disfluencies from fluent speech but may not capture the acoustic characteristics of stutters. Future work should explore more robust and diverse features, as well as larger and more representative datasets, for developing effective ARS systems.

AB Purpose: Facial movement analysis during facial gestures and speech provides clinically useful information for assessing bulbar amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, current kinematic methods have limited clinical application due to the equipment costs. Recent advancements in consumer-grade hardware and machine/deep learning made it possible to estimate facial movements from videos. This study aimed to establish the clinical validity of a video-based facial analysis for disease staging classification and estimation of clinical scores.
   Method: Fifteen individuals with ALS and 11 controls participated in this study. Participants with ALS were stratified into early and late bulbar ALS groups based on their speaking rate. Participants were recorded with a three-dimensional (3D) camera (color + depth) while repeating a simple sentence 10 times. The lips and jaw movements were estimated, and features related to sentence duration and facial movements were used to train a machine learning model for multiclass classification and to predict the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) bulbar subscore and speaking rate.
   Results: The classification model successfully separated healthy controls, the early ALS group, and the late ALS group with an overall accuracy of 96.1%. Video-based features demonstrated a high ability to estimate the speaking rate (adjusted R-2 = .82) and a moderate ability to predict the ALSFRS-R bulbar subscore (adjusted R-2 = .55).
   Conclusions: The proposed approach based on a 3D camera and machine learning algorithms represents an easy-to-use and inexpensive system that can be included as part of a clinical assessment of bulbar ALS to integrate facial movement analysis with other clinical data seamlessly

AB In recent years, Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) have been extensively adopted in broad Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications and have demonstrated ability and effectiveness in solving learning problems. However, developing high-performance hardware accelerators on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) for CNNs often demands skills in hardware design and verification, accurate distribution localization, and long development cycles. Besides, the depth of CNN architectures increases by reusing and replicating several layers. In this work, we take advantage of the replication of CNN layers to achieve improvement in design performance and productivity. We propose a programming flow for CNNs on FPGA to generate high-performance accelerators by assembling CNN pre-implemented components as a puzzle based on the graph topology. Using pre-implemented components allows us to use minimum of resources, predict the performance, and gain in productivity since there is no need to synthesize any Hardware Description Language (HDL) source code. Furthermore, the pre-implemented components are reused for different range of applications, reducing the engineering time. Through prototyping, we demonstrate the viability and relevance of our approach. Experiments show a productivity improvement of up to 69% compared to a traditional FPGA implementation while achieving over 1.75x higher Fmax with lower resources and higher energy efficiency.(C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB For successful printed circuit board (PCB) reverse engineering (RE), the resulting device must retain the physical characteristics and functionality of the original. Although the applications of RE are within the discretion of the executing party, establishing a viable, non-destructive framework for analysis is vital for any stakeholder in the PCB industry. A widely regarded approach in PCB RE uses non-destructive x-ray computed tomography (CT) to produce three-dimensional volumes with several slices of data corresponding to multi-layered PCBs. However, the noise sources specific to x-ray CT and variability fromdesigners hampers the thorough acquisition of features necessary for successful RE. This article investigates a deep learning approach as a successor to the current state-of-the-art for detecting vias on PCB x-ray CT images; vias are a key building block of PCB designs. During RE, vias offer an understanding of the PCB's electrical connections across multiple layers. Our method is an improvement on an earlier iteration which demonstrates significantly faster runtime with quality of results comparable to or better than the current state-of-the-art, unsupervised iterative Hough-based method. Compared with the Hough-based method, the current framework is 4.5 times faster for the discrete image scenario and 24.1 times faster for the volumetric image scenario. The upgrades to the prior deep learning version include faster feature-based detection for real-world usability and adaptive post-processing methods to improve the quality of detections.

AB Enzymatic browning is a major quality defect of packaged "ready-to-eat" fresh-cut lettuce salads. While there have been many research and breeding efforts to counter this problem, progress is hindered by the lack of a technology to identify and quantify browning rapidly, objectively, and reliably. Here, we report a deep learning model for lettuce browning score prediction. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first-of-its-kind on deep learning for lettuce browning prediction using a Siamese Quadratic Swin (SQ-Swin) transformer with several highlights. First, our model includes quadratic features in the transformer model which is more powerful to incorporate real world representations than the linear transformer. Second, a multi-scale training strategy is employed to augment the data and explore more of the inherent self-similarity of the lettuce images. Third, the proposed model uses a siamese architecture which learns the inter-relations among the limited training samples. Fourth, the model is pretrained on the ImageNet and then trained with the reptile meta-learning algorithm to learn higher-order gradients than a regular one. Experiment results on the fresh-cut lettuce datasets show that the proposed SQ-Swin outperforms the traditional methods and other deep learning-based backbones.

AB Spatio-temporal modeling of parcel-level land development dynamics is essential to maintain sustainable urban growth. Modeling parcel-level urban development controlling contemporaneous and historical conditions involve computational challenges since data sizes grow quickly beyond the capabilities of conventional statistical-based spatial models. Machine Learning (ML) methods provide computationally feasible methods for large-scale data sets. This paper introduces new ML applications using advanced algorithms and GPU parallel processing to model large-scale urban land developments. Special attention is given to accelerating the construction of spatial weight matrices and training ML models. Specifically, artificial neural networks and random forests are applied to the state of Florida's land-use data, which contains nearly 9 million parcels, to predict parcels with changes in their land use based on historical and neighborhood data. The adaptive Hashing algorithm coupled with GPU parallel processing accelerates the average processing time for identifying the fixed number of nearest neighbors used for accounting spatial autocorrelation, by almost 16,000 times. Also, ML model training times are shortened by 49-547 times using GPU. Further, our best ML model achieves approximately 92% accuracy while outperforming some competing methods, including logistic regression. Such a high prediction accuracy helps policymakers adjust budget allocations to meet local land-use change projections.

AB Neural networks have become increasingly popular in the field of machine learning and have been successfully used in many applied fields (e.g., imaging recognition). With more and more research has been conducted on neural networks, we have a better understanding of the statistical proprieties of neural networks. While many studies focus on bounding the prediction error of neural network estimators, limited research has been done on the statistical inference of neural networks. From a statistical point of view, it is of great interest to investigate the statistical inference of neural networks as it could facilitate hypothesis testing in many fields (e.g., genetics, epidemiology, and medical science). In this paper, we propose a goodness-of-fit test statistic based on neural network sieve estimators. The test statistic follows an asymptotic distribution, which makes it easy to use in practice. We have also verified the theoretical asymptotic results via simulation studies and a real data application. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID GENERATION
AB A surrogate model of the runaway electron avalanche growth rate in a magnetic fusion plasma is developed. This is accomplished by employing a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to learn the parametric solution of the adjoint to the relativistic Fokker-Planck equation. The resulting PINN is able to evaluate the runaway probability function across a broad range of parameters in the absence of any synthetic or experimental data. This surrogate of the adjoint relativistic Fokker-Planck equation is then used to infer the avalanche growth rate as a function of the electric field, synchrotron radiation and effective charge. Predictions of the avalanche PINN are compared against first principle calculations of the avalanche growth rate with excellent agreement observed across a broad range of parameters.

AB Human activities generate a large amount of environmental pollutants, including drugs and agricultural and industrial chemicals that are released into the air, water, and soil. Environmental pollutants can enter food animals through contaminated feed and water, posing risks to human health via the food chain. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling is used to predict the target organ dosimetry informing human health risk assessment. However, there is a lack of critical reviews concerning PBPK models for environmental pollutants in food animals in the last several years (2020-2024). This review is part of a series of reviews focusing on applications of PBPK models for drugs and environmental chemicals in food animals to inform human health and food safety assessments. Part I is focused on veterinary drugs. The present article is Part II and focuses on environmental chemicals, including pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), bisphenols, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). This article discusses the existing challenges in developing PBPK models for environmental pollutants and shares our perspectives on future directions, including the combinations of in vitro to in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE), machine learning and artificial intelligence, read-across approaches, and quantitative pharmacodynamic modeling to enhance the potential applications of PBPK models in assessing human health and food safety.

AB Background: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) underestimation of prostate cancer extent complicates the definition of focal treatment margins.
   Objective: To validate focal treatment margins produced by an artificial intelligence (AI) model.
   Design, setting, and participants: Testing was conducted retrospectively in an independent dataset of 50 consecutive patients who had radical prostatectomy for intermediate-risk cancer. An AI deep learning model incorporated multimodal imaging and biopsy data to produce three-dimensional cancer estimation maps and margins. AI margins were compared with conventional MRI regions of interest (ROIs), 10-mm margins around ROIs, and hemigland margins. The AI model also furnished predictions of negative surgical margin probability, which were assessed for accuracy.
   Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Comparing AI with conventional margins, sensitivity was evaluated using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and negative margin rates using chi-square tests. Predicted versus observed negative margin probability was assessed using linear regression. Clinically significant prostate cancer (International Society of Urological Pathology grade >= 2) delineated on whole-mount histopathology served as ground truth.
   Results and limitations: The mean sensitivity for cancer-bearing voxels was higher for AI margins (97%) than for conventional ROIs (37%, p < 0.001), 10-mm ROI margins (93%, p = 0.24), and hemigland margins (94%, p < 0.001). For index lesions, AI margins were more often negative (90%) than conventional ROIs (0%, p < 0.001), 10-mm ROI margins (82%, p = 0.24), and hemigland margins (66%, p = 0.004). Predicted and observed negative margin probabilities were strongly correlated (R-2 = 0.98, median error = 4%). Limitations include a validation dataset derived from a single institution's prostatectomy population.
   Conclusions: The AI model was accurate and effective in an independent test set. This approach could improve and standardize treatment margin definition, potentially reducing cancer recurrence rates. Furthermore, an accurate assessment of negative margin probability could facilitate informed decision-making for patients and physicians.
   Patient summary: Artificial intelligence was used to predict the extent of tumors in surgically removed prostate specimens. It predicted tumor margins more accurately than conventional methods. (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of European Association of Urology.

AB Acuity assessments are vital for timely interventions and fair resource allocation in critical care settings. Conventional acuity scoring systems heavily depend on subjective patient assessments, leaving room for implicit bias and errors. These assessments are often manual, time-consuming, intermittent, and challenging to interpret accurately, especially for healthcare providers. This risk of bias and error is likely most pronounced in time-constrained and high-stakes environments, such as critical care settings. Furthermore, such scores do not incorporate other information, such as patients' mobility level, which can indicate recovery or deterioration in the intensive care unit (ICU), especially at a granular level. We hypothesized that wearable sensor data could assist in assessing patient acuity granularly, especially in conjunction with clinical data from electronic health records (EHR). In this prospective study, we evaluated the impact of integrating mobility data collected from wrist-worn accelerometers with clinical data obtained from EHR for estimating acuity. Accelerometry data were collected from 87 patients wearing accelerometers on their wrists in an academic hospital setting. The data was evaluated using five deep neural network models: VGG, ResNet, MobileNet, SqueezeNet, and a custom Transformer network. These models outperformed a rule-based clinical score (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, SOFA) used as a baseline when predicting acuity state (for ground truth we labeled as unstable patients if they needed life-supporting therapies, and as stable otherwise), particularly regarding the precision, sensitivity, and F1 score. The results demonstrate that integrating accelerometer data with demographics and clinical variables improves predictive performance compared to traditional scoring systems in healthcare. Deep learning models consistently outperformed the SOFA score baseline across various scenarios, showing notable enhancements in metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC), precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. The most comprehensive scenario, leveraging accelerometer, demographics, and clinical data, achieved the highest AUC of 0.73, compared to 0.53 when using SOFA score as the baseline, with significant improvements in precision (0.80 vs. 0.23), specificity (0.79 vs. 0.73), and F1 score (0.77 vs. 0.66). This study demonstrates a novel approach beyond the simplistic differentiation between stable and unstable conditions. By incorporating mobility and comprehensive patient information, we distinguish between these states in critically ill patients and capture essential nuances in physiology and functional status. Unlike rudimentary definitions, such as equating low blood pressure with instability, our methodology delves deeper, offering a more holistic understanding and potentially valuable insights for acuity assessment.

AB The citrus industry is an important constituent of Florida's overall agricultural economy. Proper disease control measures must be undertaken in citrus groves to minimize losses. Technological strategies using machine vision and artificial intelligence are being investigated to achieve intelligent farming, including early detection of diseases in groves, selective fungicide application, etc. This research used a texture analysis method termed the color co-occurrence method (CCM) to determine whether classification algorithms could be used to identify diseased and normal citrus leaves. Normal and diseased citrus leaf samples with greasy spot, melanose, and scab were collected in the field and brought to the laboratory for the development of suitable segmentation and classification algorithms. Four feature models were created for classification analysis using varying subsets of a 39-variable texture feature set. The classification strategies used were based on a Mahalanobis minimum distance classifier using the nearest neighbor principle, as well as neural network classifiers based on the back-propagation algorithm and radial basis functions. The leaf sample discriminant analysis using the Mahalanobis statistical classifier and the CCM textural analysis achieved classification accuracies of over 95% for all classes (99% mean accuracy) when using hue and saturation texture features. Likewise, a back-propagation neural network algorithm achieved accuracies of over 90%,for all classes (95% mean accuracy) when using hue and saturation features. It was concluded that the Mahalanobis statistical classifier and the back-propagation neural network classifier performed equally well when using ten hue and saturation texture features selected through a stepwise variable reduction method. Future studies will seek to apply the developed algorithms in a natural citrus grove environment.

AB With the rise of traffic around Earth's orbit, spacecraft mission designs have placed an unprecedented demand on the capabilities of autonomous systems. In the early 2000s, the state-of-the-art autonomous spacecraft controllers were designed for static and uncluttered environments. A little over a decade later, the challenges facing spacecraft autonomy now include cluttered, dynamic environments with time-varying constraints, logical modes, fault tolerances, uncertain dynamics, and complex maneuvers. With this rise in complexity, many areas of research have been investigating more experimental control strategies, such as reinforcement learning (RL), as a potential solution to this problem. The research presented herein aims to expand on efforts to quantify the use of RL in autonomous rendezvous, proximity operations, and docking (ARPOD) environments, with consideration to the inherent drawbacks of the more common algorithms present in the field. We present hierarchical model-based RL as a solution to an autonomous docking problem. This algorithm can learn satellite parameters, extrapolate trajectory information, and learn uncertain dynamics via data collection. By using gradient-free model predictive control logic, the algorithm can handle nondifferentiable objectives and complex constraints. Lastly, the hierarchical structure demonstrates an ability to generate feasible trajectories in the presence of integrated third-party subcontrollers commonly found in spacecraft. This study highlights the ability of the hierarchical algorithm to combine and manipulate third-party subpolicies to achieve trajectories not previously trained on.

AB Background and purpose There are distinct challenges in the preprocessing of spinal cord fMRI data, particularly concerning the mitigation of voluntary or involuntary movement artifacts during image acquisition. Despite the notable progress in data processing techniques for movement detection and correction, applying motion correction algorithms developed for the brain cortex to the brainstem and spinal cord remains a challenging endeavor.Methods In this study, we employed a deep learning-based convolutional neural network (CNN) named DeepRetroMoCo, trained using an unsupervised learning algorithm. Our goal was to detect and rectify motion artifacts in axial T2*-weighted spinal cord data. The training dataset consisted of spinal cord fMRI data from 27 participants, comprising 135 runs for training and 81 runs for testing.Results To evaluate the efficacy of DeepRetroMoCo, we compared its performance against the sct_fmri_moco method implemented in the spinal cord toolbox. We assessed the motion-corrected images using two metrics: the average temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR) and Delta Variation Signal (DVARS) for both raw and motion-corrected data. Notably, the average tSNR in the cervical cord was significantly higher when DeepRetroMoCo was utilized for motion correction, compared to the sct_fmri_moco method. Additionally, the average DVARS values were lower in images corrected by DeepRetroMoCo, indicating a superior reduction in motion artifacts. Moreover, DeepRetroMoCo exhibited a significantly shorter processing time compared to sct_fmri_moco.Conclusion Our findings strongly support the notion that DeepRetroMoCo represents a substantial improvement in motion correction procedures for fMRI data acquired from the cervical spinal cord. This novel deep learning-based approach showcases enhanced performance, offering a promising solution to address the challenges posed by motion artifacts in spinal cord fMRI data.

AB Electronic systems rely on efficient hardware, popularly known as system-on-chip (SoC), to support its core functionalities. A typical SoC consists of diverse components gathered from third-party vendors to reduce SoC design cost and meet time-to-market constraints. Unfortunately, the participation of third-party companies in global supply chain introduces potential security vulnerabilities. There is a critical need to efficiently detect and mitigate hardware vulnerabilities. Machine learning has been successfully used in hardware security verification as well as development of effective countermeasures. There are recent surveys on hardware Trojan detection using machine learning. To the best of our knowledge, there are no comprehensive surveys on utilization of machine learning techniques for detection and mitigation of a wide variety of hardware vulnerabilities including malicious implants (e.g., hardware Trojans), side-channel leakage, reverse engineering, and supply-chain vulnerabilities (e.g., counterfeiting, overbuilding and recycling). In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of hardware vulnerability analysis using machine learning techniques. Specifically, we discuss how existing approaches effectively utilize machine learning algorithms for hardware security verification using simulation-based validation, formal verification as well as side-channel analysis.

AB This paper devises a data-driven off-policy inverse reinforcement learning algorithm for discrete- time linear Markov jump systems. Leveraging observed behaviors from multi-mode Markov jump systems optimized with respect to unknown mode-wise cost functions, our algorithm reconstructs each mode's associated cost function and control policies. Our approach certifies mean-square asymptotic stability, unbiased convergence, and nonuniqueness. Notably, the proposed algorithm operates solely on demonstrated behavioral data, eliminating the need for system models, prior knowledge of transition probabilities, or initial control gains. The practical efficacy of our approach is validated. (c) 2025 Elsevier Ltd. All rights are reserved, including those for text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.

AB Changes in morpho-physiological traits are important for biotic or abiotic stresses in sugarcane (Saccharum spp. interspecific hybrids). Ground measurements of such traits are labor-intensive and time-consuming. Therefore, predicting them using aerial imagery can be important for detecting stress and timely management. In this study, ground data and aerial imagery were collected from plant cane and first ratoon (two site-years) field trials of the last stage (Stage IV) of the Canal Point sugarcane cultivar development program in Florida. There were multiple genotypes (12 plant cane: 9 first ratoon) with six replications in each trial. Data were collected on soil plant analysis development (SPAD), leaf area index (LAI), plant height, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and number of millable stalks per hectare. Aerial imageries were collected using a hyperspectral sensor, and ground data using handheld sensors and manual readings on multiple dates (April, July, and September) to determine the best timing in morpho-physiological trait prediction. The gradient boosting regression tree was selected as the best prediction model. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was utilized to determine the model's prediction accuracy. Results showed that SPAD was predicted with higher accuracy (89%) compared to other traits. July was observed as the best time for predicting most of the morpho-physiological traits in plant cane and first ratoon. Furthermore, the NDVI values collected by GreenSeeker and UAV imaging were compared using the Bland-Altman degree of agreement, and it was found that the mean difference of NDVI values between the two sensing systems was low (0.09).

AB Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] is a significant source of protein and oil and is also widely used as animal feed. Thus, developing lines that are superior in terms of yield, protein, and oil content is important to feed the ever-growing population. As opposed to high-cost phenotyping, genotyping is both cost and time efficient for breeders because evaluating new lines in different environments (location-year combinations) can be costly. Several genomic prediction (GP) methods have been developed to use the marker and environment data effectively to predict the yield or other relevant phenotypic traits of crops. Our study compares a conventional GP method (genomic best linear unbiased predictor [GBLUP]), a kernel method (Gaussian kernel [GK]), an artificial-intelligence (AI) method (deep learning [DL]), and a hybrid method that corresponds to the emulation of a DL model using a kernel method (an arc-cosine kernel [AK]) in terms of their prediction accuracies for predicting grain yield, oil, and protein using data from the soybean nested association mapping experiment (1,379 genotypes tested in six environments, all genotypes in all environments). The relative performance of the four methods varied with the response variable and whether the model includes the genotype x environmental interaction (GxE) effects or not. The GBLUP consistently showed better performances, whereas GK and AK followed a similar pattern to GBLUP and DL performed slightly worse than the other three methods in most of the cases; however, this may also be attributed to suboptimal hyperparameters. The DL method performed particularly worse than the other three methods in presence of the GxE effects.

AB Imitation learning leverages example demonstrations to teach a policy to replicate a desired behavior. In this investigation, the example demonstrations consist of open-loop optimal trajectories calculated off-line. This paper introduces the use of imitation learning to demonstrate optimal feedback control of two different high-fidelity 6-degree-of-freedom (6DOF) lander models. A loss of optimality is shown when disturbances are applied to policies trained only with nominal trajectories. Methodologies such as multi-phase optimal control and triple -single-phase optimal control are applied to include disturbances in the optimal trajectory generation, and the policies are trained to mitigate loss of optimality when disturbances are applied. Monte Carlo simulations show that loss of optimality can be mitigated by including disturbances in the optimal trajectory generation and training data.

AB Strawberry growers in Florida suffer from a lack of efficient and accurate yield forecasts for strawberries, which would allow them to allocate optimal labor and equipment, as well as other resources for harvesting, transportation, and marketing. Accurate estimation of the number of strawberry flowers and their distribution in a strawberry field is, therefore, imperative for predicting the coming strawberry yield. Usually, the number of flowers and their distribution are estimated manually, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and subjective. In this paper, we develop an automatic strawberry flower detection system for yield prediction with minimal labor and time costs. The system used a small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) (DJI Technology Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China) equipped with an RGB (red, green, blue) camera to capture near-ground images of two varieties (Sensation and Radiance) at two different heights (2 m and 3 m) and built orthoimages of a 402 m(2) strawberry field. The orthoimages were automatically processed using the Pix4D software and split into sequential pieces for deep learning detection. A faster region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN), a state-of-the-art deep neural network model, was chosen for the detection and counting of the number of flowers, mature strawberries, and immature strawberries. The mean average precision (mAP) was 0.83 for all detected objects at 2 m heights and 0.72 for all detected objects at 3 m heights. We adopted this model to count strawberry flowers in November and December from 2 m aerial images and compared the results with a manual count. The average deep learning counting accuracy was 84.1% with average occlusion of 13.5%. Using this system could provide accurate counts of strawberry flowers, which can be used to forecast future yields and build distribution maps to help farmers observe the growth cycle of strawberry fields.

AB Accurately segmenting plant parts from imagery is vital for improving crop phenotypic traits. However, current 3D deep learning models for segmentation in point cloud data require specific network architectures that are usually manually designed, which is both tedious and suboptimal. To overcome this issue, a 3D neural architecture search (NAS) was performed in this study to optimize cotton plant part segmentation. The search space was designed using Point Voxel Convolution (PVConv) as the basic building block of the network. The NAS framework included a supernetwork with weight sharing and an evolutionary search to find optimal candidates, with three surrogate learners to predict mean IoU, latency, and memory footprint. The optimal candidate searched from the proposed method consisted of five PVConv layers with either 32 or 512 output channels, achieving mean IoU and accuracy of over 90 % and 96 %, respectively, and outperforming manually designed architectures. Additionally, the evolutionary search was updated to search for architectures satisfying memory and time constraints, with searched architectures achieving mean IoU and accuracy of >84 % and 94 %, respectively. Furthermore, a differentiable architecture search (DARTS) utilizing PVConv operation was implemented for comparison, and our method demonstrated better segmentation performance with a margin of >2 % and 1 % in mean IoU and accuracy, respectively. Overall, the proposed method can be applied to segment cotton plants with an accuracy over 94 %, while adjusting to available resource constraints.

ID CONTENT-ADDRESSABLE MEMORY
AB Storage and retrieval of data in a computer memory play a major role in system performance. Traditionally, computer memory organization is 'static'-i.e. it does not change based on the application-specific characteristics in memory access behaviour during system operation. Specifically, in the case of a content-operated memory (COM), the association of a data block with a search pattern (or cues) and the granularity (details) of a stored data do not evolve. Such a static nature of computer memory, we observe, not only limits the amount of data we can store in a given physical storage, but it also misses the opportunity for performance improvement in various applications. On the contrary, human memory is characterized by seemingly infinite plasticity in storing and retrieving data-as well as dynamically creating/updating the associations between data and corresponding cues. In this paper, we introduce BINGO, a brain-inspired learning memory paradigm that organizes the memory as a flexible neural memory network. In BINGO, the network structure, strength of associations, and granularity of the data adjust continuously during system operation, providing unprecedented plasticity and performance benefits. We present the associated storage/retrieval/retention algorithms in BINGO, which integrate a formalized learning process.

AB Obtaining the high-resolution distribution characteristics of urban air pollutants is crucial for effective pollution control and public health. In order to fulfill it, mobile monitoring offers a novel and practical approach compared to traditional fixed monitoring methods. However, the sparsity of mobile monitoring data still makes it a challenge to recover the high-resolution pollutant concentration across an entire area. To tackle the sparsity issue and fulfill a prediction of the spatiotemporal distribution of PM2.5, a high-resolution urban PM 2.5 prediction method was proposed based on mobile monitoring data in this study. This method enables prediction with a spatial resolution of 500m x 500m and a temporal resolution of 1 h. First, a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) was trained using mobile monitoring of PM 2.5 concentration and exogenous features to obtain complete spatiotemporal PM 2.5 concentration. Second, a model consisting of Convolutional Neural Network and Transformer (CNN-Transformer) with a customised loss function was established to predict high-resolution PM 2.5 concentration based on complete spatiotemporal data. The method was validated using real-world data collected from Cangzhou, China. The numerical results from cross-validation showed an R2 of 0.925 for imputation and 0.887 for prediction, demonstrating this method is suitable for high-resolution spatiotemporal prediction of PM 2.5 concentration based on mobile monitoring data.

ID ASYMPTOTIC TRACKING; TIME
AB An online adaptive reinforcement learning-based solution is developed for the infinite-horizon optimal control problem for continuous-time uncertain nonlinear systems. A novel actor-critic-identifier (ACI) is proposed to approximate the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation using three neural network (NN) structures actor and critic NNs approximate the optimal control and the optimal value function, respectively, and a robust dynamic neural network identifier asymptotically approximates the uncertain system dynamics. An advantage of using the ACI architecture is that learning by the actor, critic, and identifier is continuous and simultaneous, without requiring knowledge of system drift dynamics. Convergence of the algorithm is analyzed using Lyapunov-based adaptive control methods. A persistence of excitation condition is required to guarantee exponential convergence to a bounded region in the neighborhood of the optimal control and uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB) stability of the closed-loop system. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the actor-critic-identifier method for approximate optimal control. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The spittlebug (Aeneolamia varia) is one of the most important sugarcane pests in Colombia, where a recent increase in population and distribution specially in southwestern Colombia have led to the need for new technologies for integrated pest management. The objectives of this study were to determine the spatial distribution of this pest in commercial sugarcane fields and to validate machine learning (ML) tools for indirect injury detection and impact on yield (damage) using satellite images. This study was carried out in fields grown with the CC 01-1940 variety in El Cerrito, Valle del Cauca, Colombia, where systematic sampling of the populations (number of adults and nymphs per stem) was carried out. The spatial aggregation and distribution were determined using Moran's index and point patterns, sequence observations, and analysis with distance indicators (Sadie). The indirect injury detection and quantification of the impact on production were carried out with a ML approach using satellite image products with 10 m spatial and five days temporal resolutions, obtained from a Sentinel-2 sensor using Google Earth Engine. The results indicated that spittlebug populations had an aggregate spatial behavior and high spatial dependence. In addition, the ML algorithms predicted spittlebug injury, and the effect on production was estimated at 26.4 tons of cane per hectare, which represented a 17% reduction in the expected yield. The use of spatial analysis and remote sensing tools are an alternative for indirect detection of injury and for understanding population dynamics of the pest in sugarcane, so they can become instrumental for decision-making on an integrated pest management program.

AB This work aims at developing a generalizable Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction method in the meta-learning framework. Specifically, we develop a deep reconstruction network induced by a learnable optimization algorithm (LOA) to solve the nonconvex nonsmooth variational model of MRI image reconstruction. In this model, the nonconvex nonsmooth regularization term is parameterized as a structured deep network where the network parameters can be learned from data. We partition these network parameters into two parts: a task-invariant part for the common feature encoder component of the regularization, and a task-specific part to account for the variations in the heterogeneous training and testing data. We train the regularization parameters in a bilevel optimization framework which significantly improves the robustness of the training process and the generalization ability of the network. We conduct a series of numerical experiments using heterogeneous MRI data sets with various undersampling patterns, ratios, and acquisition settings. The experimental results show that our network yields greatly improved reconstruction quality over existing methods and can generalize well to new reconstruction problems whose undersampling patterns/trajectories are not present during training.

AB Inthis paper, we investigate energy-efficient channel switching for secondary users (SUs) in cognitive radio networks. Unlike existing schemes where SUs adopt the same channel switching strategies regardless of which channel they currently stay at, our scheme allows SUs to adapt their channel switching strategies to the primary users' (PUs') behaviors on the current channels and apply different channel switching strategies on different channels. Considering the unknown PUs' behaviors, we formulate a reinforcement learning problem which allows SUs to learn channel switching schemes by interacting with the environment. Through simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned channel switching scheme.

AB The assessment of bus stop amenities is important for providing fundamental data for public transit research, planning, and infrastructure enhancements. So far, public data on the amenities at bus stops have largely been unavailable. This study develops an automated, low-cost, and generalizable approach using Google Street View images and deep learning techniques to evaluate bus stop amenities. Leveraging the latest YOLOv8 model, transfer learning, and a dynamic prediction algorithm, our approach achieves efficient detection of shelters and benches with high accuracy and precision in major Florida cities. Results reveal highly heterogeneous spatial patterns for both shelters and benches within and across cities. Additionally, we conducted several tests to evaluate the transferability of the system to other urban contexts, which shows that highly accurate feature detection results can be achieved through model fine-tuning on a small sample of local data. In summary, the proposed system offers a scalable and efficient solution for large-scale real-time assessment of bus stop amenities, which can inform public transportation research and planning, especially for future transit infrastructure improvements.

AB Canine hypoadrenocorticism (CHA) is a life-threatening condition that affects approximately 3 of 1,000 dogs. It has a wide array of clinical signs and is known to mimic other disease processes, including kidney and gastrointestinal diseases, creating a diagnostic challenge. Because CHA can be fatal if not appropriately treated, there is risk to the patient if the condition is not diagnosed. However, the prognosis is excellent with appropriate therapy. A major hurdle to diagnosing CHA is the lack of awareness and low index of suspicion. Once suspected, the application and interpretation of conclusive diagnostic tests is relatively straight forward. In this study, machine learning methods were employed to aid in the diagnosis of CHA using routinely collected screening diagnostics (complete blood count and serum chemistry panel). These data were collected for 908 control dogs (suspected to have CHA, but disease ruled out) and 133 dogs with confirmed CHA. A boosted tree algorithm (AdaBoost) was trained with 80% of the collected data, and 20% was then utilized as test data to assess performance. Algorithm learning was demonstrated as the training set was increased from 0 to 600 dogs. The developed algorithm model has a sensitivity of 96.3% (95% CI, 81.7%-99.8%), specificity of 97.2% (95% CI, 93.7%-98.8%), and an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.994 (95% CI, 0.984-0.999), and it outperforms other screening methods including logistic regression analysis. An easy-to-use graphical interface allows the practitioner to easily implement this technology to screen for CHA leading to improved outcomes for patients and owners. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB Developing artificial intelligence (AI) equitably necessitates understanding how nonexperts conceptualize and share news about technoscientific risk. We examine a model predicting AI information sharing online from an interaction of framing strategies, through psychological proximity to the impacts of AI and perceived AI risk. A panel of N = 412 participants were exposed to either a control message; or one of four manipulated messages related to AI risks. Contrary to expectations, thematically framed explicit risk news primed psychological proximity compared to both a control message and episodic frame condition. Meanwhile, episodic explicit risk frames did not prime psychological proximity over a control message. These results contest the notion that episodic frames should be associated with psychological proximity to a risk over more general framing strategies. Our results support prior research suggesting that where risk-news primes psychological proximity, the decrease in distance is in-turn associated with greater risk perception and increased likelihood of news sharing online.

AB Extreme learning machine (ELM) techniques have received considerable attention in the computational intelligence and machine learning communities because of the significantly low computational time required for training new classifiers. ELM provides solutions for regression, clustering, binary classification, multiclass classifications and so on, but not for multi-label learning. Multi-label learning deals with objects having multiple labels simultaneously, which widely exist in real-world applications. Therefore, a thresholding method-based ELM is proposed in this paper to adapt ELM to multi-label classification, called extreme learning machine for multi-label classification (ELM-ML). ELM-ML outperforms other multi-label classification methods in several standard data sets in most cases, especially for applications which only have a small labeled data set.

AB This paper proposes a divide-and-conquer strategy for designing brain machine interfaces. A nonlinear combination of competitively trained local linear models (experts) is used to identify the mapping from neuronal activity in cortical areas associated with arm movement to the hand position of a primate. The proposed architecture and the training algorithm are described in detail and numerical performance comparisons with alternative linear and nonlinear modeling approaches, including time-delay neural networks and recursive multilayer perceptrons, are presented. This new strategy allows training the local linear models using normalized LMS and using a relatively smaller nonlinear network to efficiently combine the predictions of the linear experts. This leads to savings in computational requirements, while the performance is still similar to a large fully nonlinear network. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Due to the continuous increase in the globalized outsourcing of printed circuit board (PCB) fabrication, PCB counterfeits have increased by a significant margin, necessitating rapid and advanced hardware assurance techniques. PCB image segmentation is the primary step in PCB assurance. Over the years, few PCB component segmentation methods have been proposed, and none of those has provided a definite performance benchmark. Besides, those methods have not discussed how the performance is correlated with underlying data or annotation quality. This work presents a PCB image segmentation benchmark. In addition, we explore how annotation quality affects component segmentation and present possible future research directions to work with coarse annotations to alleviate the human effort behind full data annotation tasks. We have analyzed the performance of the preferred deep neural network (DNN) architecture and Transformer architecture with the data annotation quality and presented the direction to leverage the outcome with limited quality annotations. Finally, we present the qualitative as well as the quantitative results to demonstrate the performance of our techniques and provide observations and future research directions on the overall task.

AB Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) has the potential to cause severe yield losses in peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), an important annual legume grown around the world. The most effective approach to manage the disease caused by TSWV is to grow disease resistant peanut varieties. One of the key challenges to breeding for disease resistance is to develop an accurate, reproducible and efficient disease assessment method. Accurate field-based assessment of disease incidence and severity is technically challenging and time-consuming. To address this challenge, a field-based, high-throughput assessment tool was developed to quantify the spatial distribution of disease symptoms over experimental peanut plots using a Real Time Kinematic Global Positioning System (RTK-GPS), consumer-grade cameras, a microcontroller, and an open-source machine learning software. A field experiment was designed to establish a range of disease incidence and severity scenarios. This field experiment was imaged for two seasons to develop and validate the tool. Using transfer learning, an existing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was trained from supervised training imagery to classify and quantify areas within the plot-level imagery as, symptomatic, asymptomatic, or ground. Multiple images were assessed by the machine learning model and georeferenced to individual experimental plots using RTK-GPS data. The CNN model trained to detect the symptom, ?stunting and mottling?, was evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and yielded an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.97, sensitivity of 0.77, and specificity of 0.98 on the test set. Results from the disease assessment tool were compared with results from visual disease assessments, conducted by a trained plant pathologist. Field plot level means from CNN-based assessment of stunting and mottling correlated with plot level means from visual assessment of severity (r = 0.78; P < 0.0001). To further validate the CNN-based method, the TSWV field experiment was analyzed using linear mixed models with both visual severity and CNN-based severity assessments used as responses. Both models (visual or CNN-based assessment) identified the same main effects as being significant and post hoc analysis resulted in the same separation of varieties for their severity of TSWV symptoms. The results of this study demonstrate the successful application of this tool for high-throughput disease severity assessment in peanut under field conditions.

AB A new type of data mining considers the case where the instances over which induction takes place are intelligent agents who might act strategically to thwart the learner. Instances comprised of humans, companies, or governments all have this capability. One paper calls this adversarial learning and proposes an iterated learning process-much like reinforcement learning-to determine a classifier. The current authors proposed a different approach that uses rational expectation ideas to alter the learner's problem to directly anticipate possible strategic gaming by agents during the induction process. This paper explores differences between solutions produced by these two approaches on a credit dataset and draws some general insights.

AB Background: Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection in beef cattle has received less attention than in dairy herds, despite its potential impact on the beef industry. ObjectivesTo compare six different supervised machine-learning (SML) algorithms used to identify the most important risk factors for predicting BLV seropositivity in beef cattle in Florida. Animals: Retrospective study. We used a dataset of 1511 blood sample records from the Bronson Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory, Florida Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services, submitted for BLV antibody testing from 2012 to 2022. Methods: Logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), gradient boosting (GB), random forest (RF), neural network (NN), and support vector machine (SVM) were used. Results: Of the submitted samples, 11.6% were positive for BLV. The RF model best predicted BLV infection with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.98, with a misclassification rate of 0.06. The DT model showed comparable performance to RF (AUROC, 0.94; misclassification rate, 0.06). However, the NN model had the poorest performance. The RF model showed that BLV seropositivity can be best predicted by testing beef cows during the dry season, which mostly coincides with the pre-calving processing and calving seasons, particularly for cattle raised in southern Florida. Conclusions: The RF model shows promise for predicting BLV seropositivity in beef cattle. Key predictive risk factors include the dry season months coinciding with pre-calving and calving seasons and geographic location. These findings could help develop predictive tools for effective screening for BLV infection and targeted interventions.

AB The GPT-4 large language model (LLM) and ChatGPT chatbot have emerged as accessible and capable tools for generating English-language text in a variety of formats. GPT-4 has previously performed well when applied to questions from multiple standardized examinations. However, further evaluation of trustworthiness and accuracy of GPT-4 responses across various knowledge domains is essential before its use as a reference resource. Here, we assess GPT-4 performance on nine graduate-level examinations in the biomedical sciences (seven blinded), finding that GPT-4 scores exceed the student average in seven of nine cases and exceed all student scores for four exams. GPT-4 performed very well on fill-in-the-blank, short-answer, and essay questions, and correctly answered several questions on figures sourced from published manuscripts. Conversely, GPT-4 performed poorly on questions with figures containing simulated data and those requiring a hand-drawn answer. Two GPT-4 answer-sets were flagged as plagiarism based on answer similarity and some model responses included detailed hallucinations. In addition to assessing GPT-4 performance, we discuss patterns and limitations in GPT-4 capabilities with the goal of informing design of future academic examinations in the chatbot era.

AB With rapidly evolving high-throughput technologies and consistently decreasing costs, collecting multimodal omics data in large-scale studies has become feasible. Although studying multiomics provides a new comprehensive approach in understanding the complex biological mechanisms of human diseases, the high dimensionality of omics data and the complexity of the interactions among various omics levels in contributing to disease phenotypes present tremendous analytical challenges. There is a great need of novel analytical methods to address these challenges and to facilitate multiomics analyses. In this paper, we propose a multimodal functional deep learning (MFDL) method for the analysis of high-dimensional multiomics data. The MFDL method models the complex relationships between multiomics variants and disease phenotypes through the hierarchical structure of deep neural networks and handles high-dimensional omics data using the functional data analysis technique. Furthermore, MFDL leverages the structure of the multimodal model to capture interactions between different types of omics data. Through simulation studies and real-data applications, we demonstrate the advantages of MFDL in terms of prediction accuracy and its robustness to the high dimensionality and noise within the data.

AB Objective: Drawing causal estimates from observational data is problematic, because datasets often contain underlying bias (eg, discrimination in treatment assignment). To examine causal effects, it is important to evaluate what-if scenarios-the so-called "counterfactuals." We propose a novel deep learning architecture for propensity score matching and counterfactual prediction-the deep propensity network using a sparse autoencoder (DPN-SA)-to tackle the problems of high dimensionality, nonlinear/nonparallel treatment assignment, and residual confounding when estimating treatment effects.
   Materials and Methods: We used 2 randomized prospective datasets, a semisynthetic one with nonlinear/nonparallel treatment selection bias and simulated counterfactual outcomes from the Infant Health and Development Program and a real-world dataset from the LaLonde's employment training program. We compared different configurations of the DPN-SA against logistic regression and LASSO as well as deep counterfactual networks with propensity dropout (DCN-PD). Models' performances were assessed in terms of average treatment effects, mean squared error in precision on effect's heterogeneity, and average treatment effect on the treated, over multiple training/test runs.
   Results: The DPN-SA outperformed logistic regression and LASSO by 36%-63%, and DCN-PD by 6%-10% across all datasets. All deep learning architectures yielded average treatment effects close to the true ones with low variance. Results were also robust to noise-injection and addition of correlated variables. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/Shantanu48114860/DPN-SAz.
   Discussion and Conclusion: Deep sparse autoencoders are particularly suited for treatment effect estimation studies using electronic health records because they can handle high-dimensional covariate sets, large sample sizes, and complex heterogeneity in treatment assignments.

AB Noisy labels composed of correct and corrupted ones are pervasive in practice. They might significantly deteriorate the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), because CNNs are easily overfit-ted on corrupted labels. To address this issue, inspired by an observation, deep neural networks might first memorize the probably correct-label data and then corrupt-label samples, we propose a novel yet simple self-paced resistance framework to resist corrupted labels, without using any clean valida-tion data. The proposed framework first utilizes the memorization effect of CNNs to learn a curricu-lum, which contains confident samples and provides meaningful supervision for other training samples. Then it adopts selected confident samples and a proposed resistance loss to update model parameters; the resistance loss tends to smooth model parameters' update or attain equivalent prediction over each class, thereby resisting model overfitting on corrupted labels. Finally, we unify these two modules into a single loss function and optimize it in an alternative learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significantly superior performance of the proposed framework over recent state-of-the-art methods on noisy-label data. Source codes of the proposed method are available on https://github.com/xsshi2015/ Self- paced- Resistance-Learning .(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sample complexity bounds are a common performance metric in the reinforcement learning literature. In the discounted cost, infinite horizon setting, all of the known bounds can be arbitrarily large, as the discount factor approaches unity. These results seem to imply that a very large number of samples is required to achieve an epsilon-optimal policy. The objective of the present work is to introduce a new class of algorithms that have sample complexity uniformly bounded over all discount factors. One may argue that this is impossible, due to a recent min-max lower bound. The explanation is that these prior bounds concern value function approximation and not policy approximation. We show that the asymptotic covariance of the tabular Q-learning algorithm with an optimized step-size sequence is a quadratic function of a factor that goes to infinity, as discount factor approaches 1; an essentially known result. The new relative Q-learning algorithm proposed here is shown to have asymptotic covariance that is uniformly bounded over all discount factors.

AB Identifying the native language of a person by their text written in English (L1 identification) plays an important role in such tasks as authorship profiling and identification. With the current proliferation of misinformation in social media, these methods are especially topical. Most studies in this field have focused on the development of supervised classification algorithms, that are trained on a single L1 dataset. Although multiple labeled datasets are available for L1 identification, they contain texts authored by speakers of different languages and do not completely overlap. Current approaches achieve high accuracy on available datasets, but this is attained by training an individual classifier for each dataset. Studies show that joint training of multiple classifiers on different datasets can result in sharing information between the classifiers, leading to an increase in the accuracy of both tasks. In this study, we develop a novel deep neural network (DNN) architecture for L1 classification; it is based on an adversarial multitask learning method that integrates shared knowledge from multiple L1 datasets. We propose several variants of the architecture and rigorously evaluate their performance on multiple datasets. Our results indicate the proposed multitask architecture is more efficient in terms of classification accuracy than previously proposed methods. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB In this article, we address the synchronization problem in multiplayer multiagent graphical games, where each agent has multiple control input players. Herein, an agent represents a system, and the agent's control input represents a player's outcome. We formulate a Nash-minmax strategy, where the interactions of players in the same agent are nonzero-sum, while interactions of players between agents are antagonistic (e.g., zero-sum game). That is, the players in each agent minimize their costs, while the players from neighboring agents go against and maximize the costs. This approach finds the Nash control solutions for players within each agent and the worst control solutions for players in neighboring agents. The asymptotic stability under mild conditions and Nash-minmax solutions are guaranteed in the games. Offline policy iteration and online data-driven off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms are proposed, with proven convergence, to compute the Nash-minmax solutions. A simulation example validates the proposed strategy and algorithms.

AB Design optimization of emerging nanoscale transistor technologies often requires careful design tradeoff between many objectives, including speed, power, variability, and so on. By leveraging machine learning (ML) methods, we develop a multiobjective optimization (MOO) framework for 2-D-material-based field-effect transistors (FETs) near the scaling limit. The MOO design framework performs gradient-free efficient global optimization and offers the option of using active learning. Optimum designs with a tradeoff between transistor speed, power, and variability are identified automatically for transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) and black phosphorene FETs by applying the MOO design framework that couples ML methods to quantum transport device simulations. The design optimization results show that the International Roadmap of Devices and Systems (IRDS) target of 2025 and 2028 technology nodes can be met by 2-D FETs.

AB Dynamic cache reconfiguration has been widely explored for energy optimization and performance improvement for single-core systems. Cache partitioning techniques are introduced for the shared cache in multicore systems to alleviate inter-core interference. While these techniques focus only on performance and energy, they ignore vulnerability due to soft errors. In this article, we present a static profiling based algorithm to enable vulnerability-aware energy-optimization for real-time multicore systems. Our approach can efficiently search the space of cache configurations and partitioning schemes for energy optimization while task deadlines and vulnerability constraints are satisfied. A machine learning technique has been employed to minimize the static profiling time without sacrificing the accuracy of results. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve 19.2% average energy savings compared with the base configuration, while drastically reducing the vulnerability (49.3% on average) compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, the machine learning technique enabled more than 10x speedup in static profiling time with a negligible prediction error of 3%.

AB Resilience offers a broad social-technical framework to deal with breakdown, response and recovery of transportation networks adapting to various disruptions. Although current research works model and simulate transportation resilience from different perspectives, the real-world resilience of urban road network is still unclear. In this paper, a novel end to end deep learning framework is proposed to estimate and predict the spatiotemporal patterns of transportation resilience under extreme weather events. Diffusion Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network and a dynamic-capturing algorithm of transportation resilience jointly form the backbone of this framework. The presented framework can capture the spatiotemporal dependencies of urban road network and evaluate transportation resilience based on real-world big data, including on-demand ride services data provided by DiDi Chuxing and grid meteorological data. Results show that aggregate data of related precipitation events could be used for transportation resilience modeling under extreme weather events when facing sample imbalance problem due to limited historical disaster data. In terms of observed transportation resilience, transportation network demonstrates different characteristics between sparse network and dense network, as well as general precipitation events and extreme weather events. The response time is double or triple of the recovery time, and an elastic limit exists in the recovery process of network resilience. In terms of resilience prediction, the proposed model outperforms competitors by incorporating topological information and has better predictions of the system performance degradation than other resilience indices. The above results could assist researchers and policy makers clearly understand the real-world resilience of urban road networks in both theory and practice, and take effective responses under emergent disruptive events.

AB Spanish voiced stops /b, d, g/ surfaced as fricatives [beta, (sic), gamma] in intervocalic position due to a phonological process known as spirantization or, more broadly, lenition. However, conditioned by various factors such as stress, place of articulation, flanking vowel quality, and speaking rate, phonetic studies reveal a great deal of variation and gradience of these surface forms, ranging from fricative-like to approximant-like [beta, (sic), gamma]. Several acoustic measurements have been used to quantify the degree of lenition, but none is standard. In this study, the posterior probabilities of sonorant and continuant phonological features in a corpus of Argentinian Spanish estimated by a deep learning Phonet model as measures of lenition were compared to traditional acoustic measurements of intensity, duration, and periodicity. When evaluated against known lenition factors: stress, place of articulation, surrounding vowel quality, word status, and speaking rate, the results show that sonorant and continuant posterior probabilities predict lenition patterns that are similar to those predicted by relative acoustic intensity measures and are in the direction expected by the effort-based view of lenition and previous findings. These results suggest that Phonet is a reliable alternative or additional approach to investigate the degree of lenition.

DT Article
DE Best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP); Feature importance; Partial
   dependence; Phenotype; Genotype
AB Best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) is widely used in plant research to address experimental variation. For phenotypic values, BLUP accuracy is largely dependent on properly controlled experimental repetition and how variable components are outlined in the model. Thus, determining BLUP robustness implies the need to evaluate contributions from each repetition. Here, we assessed the robustness of BLUP values for simulated or empirical phenotypic datasets, where the BLUP value and each experimental repetition served as dependent and independent (feature) variables, respectively. Our technique incorporated machine learning and partial dependence. First, we compared the feature importance estimated with the neural networks. Second, we compared estimated average marginal effects of individual repetitions, calculated with a partial dependence analysis. We showed that contributions of experimental repetitions are unequal in a phenotypic dataset, suggesting that the calculated BLUP value is likely to be influenced by some repetitions more than others (such as failing to detect simulated true positive associations). To resolve disproportionate sources, variable components in the BLUP model must be further outlined.

AB Non-destructive detection of human foodborne pathogens is critical to ensuring food safety and public health. Here, we report a new method using a paper chromogenic array coupled with a machine learning neural network (PCA-NN) to detect viable pathogens in the presence of background microflora and spoilage microbe in seafood via volatile organic compounds sensing. Morganella morganii and Shewanella putrefaciens were used as the model pathogen and spoilage bacteria. The study evaluated microbial detection in monoculture and cocktail multiplex detection. The accuracy of PCA-NN detection was first assessed on standard media and later validated on cod and salmon as real seafood models with pathogenic and spoilage bacteria, as well as background microflora. In this study PCA-NN method successfully identified pathogenic microorganisms from microflora with or without the prevalent spoilage microbe, Shewanella putrefaciens in seafood, with accuracies ranging from 90% to 99%. This approach has the potential to advance smart packaging by achieving nondestructive pathogen surveillance on food without enrichment, incubation, or other sample preparation.

DE Deep learning; Correntropy; Stacked auto-encoders; Unsupervised feature
   learning
AB Deep learning systems aim at using hierarchical models to learning high-level features from low-level features. The progress in deep learning is great in recent years. The robustness of the learning systems with deep architectures is however rarely studied and needs further investigation. In particular, the mean square error (MSE), a commonly used optimization cost function in deep learning, is rather sensitive to outliers (or impulsive noises). Robust methods are needed to improve the learning performance and immunize the harmful influences caused by outliers which are pervasive in real-world data. In this paper, we propose an efficient and robust deep learning model based on stacked auto-encoders and Correntropy-induced loss function (CLF), called CLF-based stacked auto-encoders (CSAE). CLF as a nonlinear measure of similarity is robust to outliers and can approximate different norms (from to ) of data. Essentially, CLF is an MSE in reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Different from conventional stacked auto-encoders, which use, in general, the MSE as the reconstruction loss and KL divergence as the sparsity penalty term, the reconstruction loss and sparsity penalty term in CSAE are both built with CLF. The fine-tuning procedure in CSAE is also based on CLF, which can further enhance the learning performance. The excellent and robust performance of the proposed model is confirmed by simulation experiments on MNIST benchmark dataset.

AB More than 15% of adults suffer from pathological procrastination, which leads to substantial harm to their mental and psychiatric health. Our previous work demonstrated the role of three neuroanatomical networks as neural substrates of procrastination, but their potential interaction remains unknown. Three large-scale independent samples (total n = 901) were recruited. In sample A, tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and connectome-based graph-theoretical analysis was conducted to probe association between topological properties of white matter (WM) network and procrastination. In sample B, the above analysis was reproduced to demonstrate replicability. In sample C, machine learning models were built to predict individual procrastination. TBSS results showed a negative association between procrastination and WM integrity of limbic-prefrontal connection, and a positive relationship between intra-connection within the limbic system and procrastination. Also, both the efficiency and integrity of limbic WM network were found to be linked to procrastination. The above findings were all confirmed to replicate in an independent sample; prediction models demonstrated that these WM features can predict procrastination accurately in sample C. In conclusion, this study moves forward our understanding of procrastination by clarifying the role of interplay of self-control and emotional regulation with it.

AB In this paper, we present a novel kernel adaptive recurrent filtering algorithm based on the autoregressive-moving-average (ARMA) model, which is trained with recurrent stochastic gradient descent in the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. This kernelized recurrent system, the kernel adaptive ARMA (KAARMA) algorithm, brings together the theories of adaptive signal processing and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), extending the current theory of kernel adaptive filtering (KAF) using the representer theorem to include feedback. Compared with classical feedforward KAF methods, the KAARMA algorithm provides general nonlinear solutions for complex dynamical systems in a state-space representation, with a deferred teacher signal, by propagating forward the hidden states. We demonstrate its capabilities to provide exact solutions with compact structures by solving a set of benchmark nondeterministic polynomial-complete problems involving grammatical inference. Simulation results show that the KAARMA algorithm outperforms equivalent input-space recurrent architectures using first-and second-order RNNs, demonstrating its potential as an effective learning solution for the identification and synthesis of deterministic finite automata.

AB Obtaining future traffic state evolution information is critical to traffic control algorithms design and further to intelligent transportation systems. However, accurately predicting traffic state evolution is not an easy task, although the traffic prediction-related study attracted a lot of attention. This study develops a macroscopic traffic flow model-integrated deep learning framework ( MTFD ) for the high-resolution temporal-spatial traffic state dynamic propagation on a road network, integrating temporal-spatial traffic dependency, traffic flow theory, and data analysis techniques. First, traffic state propagation on every road section is mathematically described by the CTM model given traffic initial and boundary conditions. Next, a temporal-spatial traffic dependency attention ( TSTD ) recurrent neural network is developed to predict boundary conditions factoring the traffic temporal-spatial dependency. Also, this paper develops a graph theory-based method to capture the temporal-spatial traffic dependency among the traffic on neighboring road sections. Last, the extended Kalman Filter ( EKF ) is introduced to adjust the predicted traffic state at an intersection to satisfy the conservation law. The numerical experiments illustrate that the proposed method predicts the traffic state evolution in a freeway network within 30 minutes with accuracy varying from 75%-95%. It has a better performance compared to the tested baseline models (APTN, Graph CNN-LSTM, and so on). The experimental results also illustrate that factoring traffic dependency and integrating data assimilation techniques can improve prediction accuracy.

AB The wide adoption of dicamba-tolerant (DT) soybean has led to numerous cases of off-target dicamba damage to non-DT soybean and dicot crops. This study aimed to develop a method to differentiate soybean response to dicamba using unmanned-aerial-vehicle-based imagery and machine learning models. Soybean lines were visually classified into three classes of injury, i.e., tolerant, moderate, and susceptible to off-target dicamba. A quadcopter with a built-in RGB camera was used to collect images of field plots at a height of 20 m above ground level. Seven image features were extracted for each plot, including canopy coverage, contrast, entropy, green leaf index, hue, saturation, and triangular greenness index. Classification models based on artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF) algorithms were developed to differentiate the three classes of response to dicamba. Significant differences for each feature were observed among classes and no significant differences across fields were observed. The ANN and RF models were able to precisely distinguish tolerant and susceptible lines with an overall accuracy of 0.74 and 0.75, respectively. The imagery-based classification model can be implemented in a breeding program to effectively differentiate phenotypic dicamba response and identify soybean lines with tolerance to off-target dicamba damage.

AB In this paper, we propose a novel Deep Spectral Feature Pyramid in the Frequency domain (DSFP) to share the merits of deep features and spectral approaches for long-term action recognition. More specifically, in the spatial domain, deep features of sparse sampled frames are extracted by Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to cover long-term temporal structure. In the frequency domain, appearance features of sampled frames are partitioned recursively along the time dimension and spectral transform is applied to each partitioned feature respectively. All coefficients of partitioned features are then concatenated into a video-level feature to better model the spatio-temporal structure of actions in the form of a pyramid. So DSFP could model actions from both microcosmic and macroscopic aspects. Extensive experiments conducted on two challenging action benchmarks UCF101 and HMDB51 show that our proposed DSFP is effective for spatio-temporal representation of actions and achieves comparable performance with the state-of-the-arts.

AB Pests can cause huge yield loss in crop production without timely and effective monitoring methods. The traditional method of manually counting pests is time-consuming and causes bias between different observers. Therefore, this study developed an Android -based smartphone application for automated pest counting using a deep learning model (YOLOv7 tiny). This study evaluated the smartphone application using twospotted spider mite (TSSM) detection as a case study and compared it with the manual counting method. The smartphone application records the total number of pests and the GPS coordinates into a MySQL database. The spatial interpolation method was used to generate a spatial distribution map of TSSM in real-time, which could guide growers to apply the right amount of pesticide at the right location. To train the deep learning model for TSSM detection, 3,348 images were collected using three smartphones. The YOLOv7 tiny model was trained at three input image sizes (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640 pixels). The model trained at 320x320 pixels was chosen to deploy on the smartphone application because of the superior performance for both detection accuracy and inference speed. The Android -based smartphone application was installed on two widely used smartphones (Samsung Galaxy S10e and LG Stylo 6) for field testing. The counting accuracy of TSSM motiles (all life stages except eggs) and TSSM eggs using the smartphone application was 78.1% and 75.3%, respectively. The average counting speed of the smartphone application was 233 s per strawberry (trifoliate) leaf. The smartphone application had higher counting accuracy (7.1% higher for TSSM motiles and 12.7% higher for TSSM eggs) and speed (29 s faster per leaf) than manual counting using a magnifying lens. The quick assessment of field conditions with smartphone technology can allow growers to implement quick management tactics and potentially reduce the amount of pesticides to manage TSSM, which can save growers money and protect the environment.

ID IDENTIFICATION; RNA
AB BackgroundmicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to play essential roles in a wide range of biological processes. Many computational methods have been developed to identify targets of miRNAs. However, the majority of these methods depend on pre-defined features that require considerable efforts and resources to compute and often prove suboptimal at predicting miRNA targets. ResultsWe developed a novel hybrid deep learning-based (DL-based) approach that is capable of predicting miRNA targets at a higher accuracy. This approach integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that excel in learning spatial features and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that discern sequential features. Therefore, our approach has the advantages of learning both the intrinsic spatial and sequential features of miRNA:target. The inputs for our approach are raw sequences of miRNAs and genes that can be obtained effortlessly. We applied our approach on two human datasets from recently miRNA target prediction studies and trained two models. We demonstrated that the two models consistently outperform the previous methods according to evaluation metrics on test datasets. Comparing our approach with currently available alternatives on independent datasets shows that our approach delivers substantial improvements in performance. We also show with multiple evidences that our approach is more robust than other methods on small datasets. Our study is the first study to perform comparisons across multiple existing DL-based approaches on miRNA target prediction. Furthermore, we examined the contribution of a Max pooling layer in between the CNN and RNN and demonstrated that it improves the performance of all our models. Finally, a unified model was developed that is robust on fitting different input datasets.ConclusionsWe present a new DL-based approach for predicting miRNA targets and demonstrate that our approach outperforms the current alternatives. We supplied an easy-to-use tool, miTAR, at https://github.com/tjgu/miTAR. Furthermore, our analysis results support that Max Pooling generally benefits the hybrid models and potentially prevents overfitting for hybrid models.

ID TRANSPORT PHENOMENA; NEURAL-NETWORKS; FUSION; MODEL
AB A physics-informed neural network (PINN) is used to evaluate the fast ion distribution in the hot spot of an inertial confinement fusion target. The use of tailored input and output layers to the neural network is shown to enable a PINN to learn the parametric solution to the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation in the absence of any synthetic or experimental data. As an explicit demonstration of the approach, the specific problem of Knudsen layer fusion yield reduction is treated. Here, the predictions from the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck PINN are used to provide a non-perturbative solution of the fast ion tail in the vicinity of the hot spot, thus allowing the spatial profile of the fusion reactivity to be evaluated for a range of collisionalities and hot spot conditions. Excellent agreement is found between the predictions of the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck PINN and the results from traditional numerical solvers with respect to both the energy and spatial distribution of fast ions and the fusion reactivity profile, demonstrating that the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck PINN provides an accurate and efficient means of determining the impact of Knudsen layer yield reduction across a broad range of plasma conditions.

TI DICOM Image ANalysis and Archive (DIANA): an Open-Source System for

AB In the era of data-driven medicine, rapid access and accurate interpretation of medical images are becoming increasingly important. The DICOM Image ANalysis and Archive (DIANA) system is an open-source, lightweight, and scalable Python interface that enables users to interact with hospital Picture Archiving and Communications Systems (PACS) to access such data. In this work, DIANA functionality was detailed and evaluated in the context of retrospective PACS data retrieval and two prospective clinical artificial intelligence (AI) pipelines: bone age (BA) estimation and intra-cranial hemorrhage (ICH) detection. DIANA orchestrates activity beginning with post-acquisition study discovery and ending with online notifications of findings. For AI applications, system latency (exam completion to system report time) was quantified and compared to that of clinicians (exam completion to initial report creation time). Mean DIANA latency was 9.04 +/- 3.83 and 20.17 +/- 10.16 min compared to clinician latency of 51.52 +/- 58.9 and 65.62 +/- 110.39 min for BA and ICH, respectively, with DIANA latencies being significantly lower (p < 0.001). DIANA's capabilities were also explored and found effective in retrieving and anonymizing protected health information for "big-data" medical imaging research and analysis. Mean per-image retrieval times were 1.12 +/- 0.50 and 0.08 +/- 0.01 s across x-ray and computed tomography studies, respectively. The data herein demonstrate that DIANA can flexibly integrate into existing hospital infrastructure and improve the process by which researchers/clinicians access imaging repository data. This results in a simplified workflow for large data retrieval and clinical integration of AI models.

ID MECHANISM
AB The increasing Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices have produced large volumes of data. A deep learning technique is widely used to analyze the potential value of these data due to its unprecedented performance in both the academic and industrial communities. However, the data generated from the IoT devices are distributed among different users. Directly combining these data to a central server will cause privacy leakage, especially for personal sensitive data. Rather than centralized training by getting access to all these raw data, an alternative is to collaboratively learn a model in a distributed manner. However, there exist two main challenges in a distributed learning setting. The first one is how to preserve the privacy of users. The second one is to reduce the communication burden (e.g., mobile users have limited bandwidth) due to high-frequent data exchange. To address these two challenges, we design a communication efficient and privacy-preserving framework to enable different participants to distributively learn a model with a privacy protection guarantee. In particular, we develop a differentially private approximate mechanism for the distributed deep learning. In addition, we design a new gradient sparsification method to, at the first time, reduce both upload and download communication costs. The performance of the proposed framework is tested under different neural network structures for different data sets including, image classification and mobile sensor data. The experimental results demonstrate that we can reduce the communication up to only 2% compared to the full gradients exchange and achieve up to 16% accuracy increase compared to the previous works.

AB Two-dimensional materials are a class of atomically thin materials with assorted electronic and quantum properties. Accurate identification of layer thickness, especially for a single monolayer, is crucial for their characterization. This characterization process, however, is often time-consuming, requiring highly skilled researchers and expensive equipment like atomic force microscopy. This project aims to streamline the identification process by using machine learning to analyze optical images and quickly determine layer thickness. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of three machine learning models - SegNet, 1D U-Net, and 2D U-Net- in accurately identifying monolayers in microscopic images. Additionally, we explore labeling and image processing techniques to determine the most effective and accessible method for identifying layer thickness in this class of materials.

ID BUILDINGS; CONSUMPTION
AB In developed countries, buildings are involved in almost 50% of total energy use and 30% of global annual greenhouse gas emissions. The operational energy needs of buildings are highly dependent on various building physical, operational, and functional characteristics, as well as meteorological and temporal properties. Besides physics-based energy modeling of buildings, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the capability to provide faster and higher accuracy estimates, given buildings' historic energy consumption data. Looking beyond individual building levels, forecasting building energy performance can help city and community managers have a better understanding of their future energy needs, and to plan for satisfying them more efficiently. Focusing at an urban scale, this research develops a campus energy use prediction tool for predicting the effects of long-term climate change on the energy performance of buildings using AI techniques. The tool comprises four steps: Data Collection, AI Development, Model Validation, and Model Implementation, and can predict the energy use of campus buildings with 90% accuracy. We have relied on energy use data of buildings situated in the University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida (FL). To study the impact of climate change, we have used climate properties of three future weather files of Gainesville, FL, developed by the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP), represented based on their impact: median (year 2063), hottest (2057), and coldest (2041).

AB Background Perhaps nowhere else in the healthcare system than in the intensive care unit environment are the challenges to create useful models with direct time-critical clinical applications more relevant and the obstacles to achieving those goals more massive. Machine learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to define states and predict future events are commonplace activities of modern life. However, their penetration into acute care medicine has been slow, stuttering and uneven. Major obstacles to widespread effective application of AI approaches to the real-time care of the critically ill patient exist and need to be addressed.Main body Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) in acute and critical care environments support clinicians, not replace them at the bedside. As will be discussed in this review, the reasons are many and include the immaturity of AI-based systems to have situational awareness, the fundamental bias in many large databases that do not reflect the target population of patient being treated making fairness an important issue to address and technical barriers to the timely access to valid data and its display in a fashion useful for clinical workflow. The inherent "black-box" nature of many predictive algorithms and CDSS makes trustworthiness and acceptance by the medical community difficult. Logistically, collating and curating in real-time multidimensional data streams of various sources needed to inform the algorithms and ultimately display relevant clinical decisions support format that adapt to individual patient responses and signatures represent the efferent limb of these systems and is often ignored during initial validation efforts. Similarly, legal and commercial barriers to the access to many existing clinical databases limit studies to address fairness and generalizability of predictive models and management tools.Conclusions AI-based CDSS are evolving and are here to stay. It is our obligation to be good shepherds of their use and further development.

AB Thanks to advancements in diagnosis and treatment, prostate cancer patients have high long-term survival rates. Currently, an important goal is to preserve quality of life during and after treatment. The relationship between the radiation a patient receives and the subsequent side effects he experiences is complex and difficult to model or predict. Here, we use machine learning algorithms and statistical models to explore the connection between radiation treatment and post-treatment gastro-urinary function. Since only a limited number of patient datasets are currently available, we used image flipping and curvature-based interpolation methods to generate more data to leverage transfer learning. Using interpolated and augmented data, we trained a convolutional autoencoder network to obtain near-optimal starting points for the weights. A convolutional neural network then analyzed the relationship between patient-reported quality-of-life and radiation doses to the bladder and rectum. We also used analysis of variance and logistic regression to explore organ sensitivity to radiation and to develop dosage thresholds for each organ region. Our findings show no statistically significant association between the bladder and quality-of-life scores. However, we found a statistically significant association between the radiation applied to posterior and anterior rectal regions and changes in quality of life. Finally, we estimated radiation therapy dose thresholds for each organ. Our analysis connects machine learning methods with organ sensitivity, thus providing a framework for informing cancer patient care using patient reported quality-of-life metrics.

TI Hierarchical transfer learning for deep learning velocity model building
SO GEOPHYSICS
LA English
DT Article
ID CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL-NETWORK; WAVE-FORM INVERSION; PICKING; PHASE
AB Deep learning is a promising approach to velocity model building because it has the potential of processing large seismic surveys with minimal resources. By leveraging large quantities of model-gather pairs, neural networks (NNs) can automatically map data to the model space, directly providing a solution to the inverse problem. Such mapping requires big data, which proves prohibitive for 2D and 3D surveys of realistic size. We have de-veloped a transfer learning (TL) strategy. A network is first trained on a smaller subproblem, which then becomes the start-ing solution to a larger, more difficult data set, akin to the hier-archical multiscale strategy for full-waveform inversion. We perform TL by having subobjectives that escalate in complexity and by first training an NN at estimating horizontally layered velocity models and then proceeding to train an augmented net-work at estimating 2D dipping layered models. TL improves con-vergence and allows using a lesser quantity of 2D models for training. For synthetic tests, the structural similarity index mea-sure of 2D interval velocity models in the time domain is 0.893 +/- 0.052 and the root-mean-square (rms) error is (198 +/- 91) m/s. We benchmark our algorithm on the Marmousi2 model and ob-serve that our method can apply to velocity models with continu-ous deformed layers with dips up to 35 degrees. We benchmark our algorithm on 2D marine field data and produce an rms velocity model that leads to coherent stacking and a time interval velocity model that reproduces salient features of the stacked section. TL expedites and regularizes training and data-driven techniques may be applied to field data with minimal preprocessing even though we lack real target velocity models.

AB Tomato crops are susceptible to multiple diseases, several of which may be present during the same season. Therefore, rapid disease identification could enhance crop management consequently increasing the yield. In this study, nondestructive methods were developed to detect diseases that affect tomato crops, such as bacterial spot (BS), target spot (TS), and tomato yellow leaf curl (TYLC) for two varieties of tomato (susceptible and tolerant to TYLC only) by using hyperspectral sensing in two conditions: a) laboratory (benchtop scanning), and b) in field using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV-based). The stepwise discriminant analysis (STDA) and the radial basis function were applied to classify the infected plants and distinguish them from noninfected or healthy (H) plants. Multiple vegetation indices (VIs) and the M statistic method were utilized to distinguish and classify the diseased plants. In general, the classification results between healthy and diseased plants were highly accurate for all diseases; for instance, when comparing H vs. BS, TS, and TYLC in the asymptomatic stage and laboratory conditions, the classification rates were 94%, 95%, and 100%, respectively. Similarly, in the symptomatic stage, the classification rates between healthy and infected plants were 98% for BS, and 99-100% for TS and TYLC diseases. The classification results in the field conditions also showed high values of 98%, 96%, and 100%, for BS, TS, and TYLC, respectively. The VIs that could best identify these diseases were the renormalized difference vegetation index (RDVI), and the modified triangular vegetation index 1 (MTVI 1) in both laboratory and field. The results were promising and suggest the possibility to identify these diseases using remote sensing.

AB An important decision support system component is machine learning/data mining. Classical machine learning methods implicitly assume that attributes of instances under classification do not change to acquire a positive classification. However, in many situations these instances represent people or organizations that can proactively seek to alter their characteristics to gain a positive classification. We argue that the learning mechanism should take this possible strategic learning into consideration during the induction process. We call this strategic learning. In this paper we define this concept, summarize related research, and present a number of future research areas.

TI Deep-learned event variables for collider phenomenology
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
LA English
DT Article
ID MASS
AB The choice of optimal event variables is crucial for achieving the maximal sensitivity of experimental analyses. Over time, physicists have derived suitable kinematic variables for many typical event topologies in collider physics. Here, we introduce a deep-learning technique to design good event variables, which are sensitive over a wide range of values for the unknown model parameters. We demonstrate that the neural networks trained with our technique on some simple event topologies are able to reproduce standard event variables like invariant mass, transverse mass, and stransverse mass. The method is automatable and completely general and can be used to derive sensitive, previously unknown, event variables for other, more complex event topologies.

AB Intelligent tutoring systems have been in existence for decades, and their characteristics can be beneficially applied in environments utilizing information and communication technology (ICT). The "intelligence" in these systems is seen through the way these systems adapt themselves to the characteristics of the students, such as speed of learning, specific areas in which the student excels as well as falls behind, and rate of learning as more knowledge is learned. In such intelligent learning environments, the agent or set of agents can be modeled to perform pedagogical tasks. This paper considers the necessary characteristics that constitute a good intelligent tutoring system. This paper introduces a framework incorporating an incremental machine-learning approach to capture 1) the dynamics of knowledge creation in the domain of interest and 2) the learned-knowledge content of the student over time. Some of the components of the proposed system are illustrated using examples from an introductory course on database design.

AB Machine learning is becoming a popular tool to quantify galaxy morphologies and identify mergers. However, this technique relies on using an appropriate set of training data to be successful. By combining hydrodynamical simulations, synthetic observations, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we quantitatively assess how realistic simulated galaxy images must be in order to reliably classify mergers. Specifically, we compare the performance of CNNs trained with two types of galaxy images, stellar maps and dust-inclusive radiatively transferred images, each with three levels of observational realism: (1) no observational effects (idealized images), (2) realistic sky and point spread function (semirealistic images), and (3) insertion into a real sky image (fully realistic images). We find that networks trained on either idealized or semireal images have poor performance when applied to survey-realistic images. In contrast, networks trained on fully realistic images achieve 87.1 per cent classification performance. Importantly, the level of realism in the training images is much more important than whether the images included radiative transfer, or simply used the stellarmaps (87.1 per cent compared to 79.6 per cent accuracy, respectively). Therefore, one can avoid the large computational and storage cost of running radiative transfer with a relatively modest compromise in classification performance. Making photometry-based networks insensitive to colour incurs a very mild penalty to performance with survey-realistic data (86.0 per cent with r-only compared to 87.1 per cent with gri). This result demonstrates that while colour can be exploited by colour-sensitive networks, it is not necessary to achieve high accuracy and so can be avoided if desired. We provide the public release of our statistical observational realism suite, REALSIM, as a companion to this paper.

AB Molecular diffusion coefficients calculated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suffer from finite-size (i.e., finite box size and finite particle number) effects. Results from finite-sized MD simulations can be upscaled to infinite simulation size by applying a correction factor. For self-diffusion of single-component fluids, this correction has been well-studied by many researchers including Yeh and Hummer (YH); for binary fluid mixtures, a modified YH correction was recently proposed for correcting MD-predicted Maxwell-Stephan (MS) diffusion rates. Here we use both empirical and machine learning methods to identify improvements to the finite-size correction factors for both self-diffusion and MS diffusion of binary Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluid mixtures. Using artificial neural networks (ANNs), the error in the corrected LJ fluid diffusion is reduced by an order of magnitude versus existing YH corrections, and the ANN models perform well for mixtures with large dissimilarities in size and interaction energies where the YH correction proves insufficient.

AB Business-to-business (B2B) exchanges are expected to bring about lower prices for buyers through reverse auctions. Analysis of such settings for seller pricing behavior often points to mixed-strategy equilibria. In real life, it is plausible that managers learn this complex ideal behavior over time. We modeled the two-seller game in a synthetic environment, where two agents use a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to change their pricing strategy over time. We find that the agents do indeed converge towards the theoretical Nash equilibrium. The results are promising enough to consider the use of artificial learning mechanisms in electronic marketplace transactions. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

DE Deep learning; earth imagery segmentation; imperfect labels; weakly

ID QUALITY; NOISE
AB In recent years, deep learning has achieved tremendous success in image segmentation for computer vision applications. The performance of these models heavily relies on the availability of large-scale high-quality training labels (e.g., PASCAL VOC 2012). Unfortunately, such large-scale high-quality training data are often unavailable in many real-world spatial or spatiotemporal problems in earth science and remote sensing (e.g., mapping the nationwide river streams for water resource management). Although extensive efforts have been made to reduce the reliance on labeled data (e.g., semi-supervised or unsupervised learning, few-shot learning), the complex nature of geographic data such as spatial heterogeneity still requires sufficient training labels when transferring a pre-trained model from one region to another. On the other hand, it is often much easier to collect lower-quality training labels with imperfect alignment with earth imagery pixels (e.g., through interpreting coarse imagery by non-expert volunteers). However, directly training a deep neural network on imperfect labels with geometric annotation errors could significantly impact model performance. Existing research that overcomes imperfect training labels either focuses on errors in label class semantics or characterizes label location errors at the pixel level. These methods do not fully incorporate the geometric properties of label location errors in the vector representation. To fill the gap, this article proposes a weakly supervised learning framework to simultaneously update deep learning model parameters and infer hidden true vector label locations. Specifically, we model label location errors in the vector representation to partially reserve geometric properties (e.g., spatial contiguity within line segments). Evaluations on real-world datasets in the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) refinement application illustrate that the proposed framework outperforms baseline methods in classification accuracy.

AB This review describes the weaknesses of traditional clinical decision-support systems and proposes that artificial intelligence should be used to augment surgical decision-making.
   Importance Surgeons make complex, high-stakes decisions under time constraints and uncertainty, with significant effect on patient outcomes. This review describes the weaknesses of traditional clinical decision-support systems and proposes that artificial intelligence should be used to augment surgical decision-making. Observations Surgical decision-making is dominated by hypothetical-deductive reasoning, individual judgment, and heuristics. These factors can lead to bias, error, and preventable harm. Traditional predictive analytics and clinical decision-support systems are intended to augment surgical decision-making, but their clinical utility is compromised by time-consuming manual data management and suboptimal accuracy. These challenges can be overcome by automated artificial intelligence models fed by livestreaming electronic health record data with mobile device outputs. This approach would require data standardization, advances in model interpretability, careful implementation and monitoring, attention to ethical challenges involving algorithm bias and accountability for errors, and preservation of bedside assessment and human intuition in the decision-making process. Conclusions and Relevance Integration of artificial intelligence with surgical decision-making has the potential to transform care by augmenting the decision to operate, informed consent process, identification and mitigation of modifiable risk factors, decisions regarding postoperative management, and shared decisions regarding resource use.

AB Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely recognized as the foundation for machine vision systems. The conventional rule of teaching CNNs to understand images requires training images with human annotated labels, without any additional instructions. In this article, we look into a new scope and explore the guidance from text for neural network training. We present two versions of attention mechanisms to facilitate interactions between visual and semantic information and encourage CNNs to effectively distill visual features by leveraging semantic features. In contrast to dedicated text-image joint embedding methods, our method realizes asynchronous training and inference behavior: a trained model can classify images, irrespective of the text availability. This characteristic substantially improves the model scalability to multiple (multimodal) vision tasks. We also apply the proposed method onto medical imaging, which learns from richer clinical knowledge and achieves attention-based interpretable decision-making. With comprehensive validation on two natural and two medical datasets, we demonstrate that our method can effectively make use of semantic knowledge to improve CNN performance. Our method performs substantial improvement on medical image datasets. Meanwhile, it achieves promising performance for multi-label image classification and caption-image retrieval as well as excellent performance for phrase-based and multi-object localization on public benchmarks.

TI ManifoldNet: A Deep Neural Network for Manifold-Valued Data With

SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE

DT Article
DE Weighted frechet mean; equivariance; group action; riemannian manifolds
AB Geometric deep learning is a relatively nascent field that has attracted significant attention in the past few years. This is partly due to the availability of data acquired from non-euclidean domains or features extracted from euclidean-space data that reside on smooth manifolds. For instance, pose data commonly encountered in computer vision reside in Lie groups, while covariance matrices that are ubiquitous in many fields and diffusion tensors encountered in medical imaging domain reside on the manifold of symmetric positive definite matrices. Much of this data is naturally represented as a grid of manifold-valued data. In this paper we present a novel theoretical framework for developing deep neural networks to cope with these grids of manifold-valued data inputs. We also present a novel architecture to realize this theory and call it the ManifoldNet. Analogous to vector spaces where convolutions are equivalent to computing weighted sums, manifold-valued data 'convolutions' can be defined using the weighted Frechet Mean (wFM). (This requires endowing the manifold with a Riemannian structure if it did not already come with one.) The hidden layers of ManifoldNet compute wFMs of their inputs, where the weights are to be learnt. This means the data remain manifold-valued as they propagate through the hidden layers. To reduce computational complexity, we present a provably convergent recursive algorithm for computing the wFM. Further, we prove that on non-constant sectional curvature manifolds, each wFM layer is a contraction mapping and provide constructive evidence for its non-collapsibility when stacked in layers. This captures the two fundamental properties of deep network layers. Analogous to the equivariance of convolution in euclidean space to translations, we prove that the wFM is equivariant to the action of the group of isometries admitted by the Riemannian manifold on which the data reside. To showcase the performance of ManifoldNet, we present several experiments using both computer vision and medical imaging data sets.

AB Building an accurate disease risk prediction model is an essential step in the modern quest for precision medicine. While high-dimensional genomic data provides valuable data resources for the investigations of disease risk, their huge amount of noise and complex relationships between predictors and outcomes have brought tremendous analytical challenges. Deep learning model is the state-of-the-art methods for many prediction tasks, and it is a promising framework for the analysis of genomic data. However, deep learning models generally suffer from the curse of dimensionality and the lack of biological interpretability, both of which have greatly limited their applications. In this work, we have developed a deep neural network (DNN) based prediction modeling framework. We first proposed a groupwise feature importance score for feature selection, where genes harboring genetic variants with both linear and non-linear effects are efficiently detected. We then designed an explainable transfer-learning based DNN method, which can directly incorporate information from feature selection and accurately capture complex predictive effects. The proposed DNN-framework is biologically interpretable, as it is built based on the selected predictive genes. It is also computationally efficient and can be applied to genome-wide data. Through extensive simulations and real data analyses, we have demonstrated that our proposed method can not only efficiently detect predictive features, but also accurately predict disease risk, as compared to many existing methods.

AB Objective Given the importance AI in genomics and its potential impact on human health, the American Medical Informatics Association-Genomics and Translational Biomedical Informatics (GenTBI) Workgroup developed this assessment of factors that can further enable the clinical application of AI in this space.Process A list of relevant factors was developed through GenTBI workgroup discussions in multiple in-person and online meetings, along with review of pertinent publications. This list was then summarized and reviewed to achieve consensus among the group members.Conclusions Substantial informatics research and development are needed to fully realize the clinical potential of such technologies. The development of larger datasets is crucial to emulating the success AI is achieving in other domains. It is important that AI methods do not exacerbate existing socio-economic, racial, and ethnic disparities. Genomic data standards are critical to effectively scale such technologies across institutions. With so much uncertainty, complexity and novelty in genomics and medicine, and with an evolving regulatory environment, the current focus should be on using these technologies in an interface with clinicians that emphasizes the value each brings to clinical decision-making.

TI Rethinking Greulich and Pyle: A Deep Learning Approach to Pediatric Bone
   Age Assessment Using Pediatric Trauma Hand Radiographs
SO RADIOLOGY-ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Purpose: To develop a deep learning approach to bone age assessment based on a training set of developmentally normal pediatric hand radiographs and to compare this approach with automated and manual bone age assessment methods based on Greulich and Pyle (GP).
   Methods: In this retrospective study, a convolutional neural network (trauma hand radiograph-trained deep learning bone age assessment method [TDL-BAAM]) was trained on 15 129 frontal view pediatric trauma hand radiographs obtained between December 14, 2009, and May 31, 2017, from Children's Hospital of New York, to predict chronological age. A total of 214 trauma hand radiographs from Hasbro Children's Hospital were used as an independent test set. The test set was rated by the TDL-BAAM model as well as a GP-based deep learning model (GPDL-BAAM) and two pediatric radiologists (radiologists 1 and 2) using the GP method. All ratings were compared with chronological age using mean absolute error (MAE), and standard concordance analyses were performed.
   Results: The MAE of the TDL-BAAM model was 11.1 months, compared with 12.9 months for GPDL-BAAM (P=.0005), 14.6 months for radiologist 1 (P<.0001), and 16.0 for radiologist 2 (P<.0001). For TDL-BAAM, 95.3% of predictions were within 24 months of chronological age compared with 91.6% for GPDL-BAAM (P=.096), 86.0% for radiologist 1 (P<.0001), and 84.6% for radiologist 2 (P<.0001). Concordance was high between all methods and chronological age (intraclass coefficient > 0.93). Deep learning models demonstrated a systematic bias with a tendency to overpredict age for younger children versus radiologists who showed a consistent mean bias.
   Conclusion: A deep learning model trained on pediatric trauma hand radiographs is on par with automated and manual GP-based methods for bone age assessment and provides a foundation for developing population-specific deep learning algorithms for bone age assessment in modern pediatric populations.

SO COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
DE Machine learning; Crack statistics; Validation; Cost reduction
ID DISCRETE ELEMENT METHOD; EVOLUTION; MODEL
AB Failure in brittle materials under dynamic loading conditions is a result of the propagation and coalescence of microcracks. Simulating this discrete crack evolution at the continuum level is computationally expensive or, in some cases, intractable, resulting in the need to make broad assumptions or neglect key physics. We have developed an approach using machine learning that overcomes the current inability to represent meso-scale physics at the macro-scale. Our approach leverages damage and stress data from a computationally expensive high-fidelity model that explicitly resolves microcrack behavior to build an inexpensive machine learning emulator. Once trained, the machine learning emulator is used to predict the evolution of crack length statistics, which then informs a continuum-scale constitutive model. This results in a significant speed-up of the workflow by four orders of magnitude. Both the machine learning emulator and the continuum-scale model are validated against the high-fidelity model and experimental data, respectively, showing excellent agreement. There are two key findings. The first is that we can reduce the dimensionality of the problem, establishing that the machine learning emulator only needs the length of the longest crack and one of the maximum stress components to capture the necessary physics. Another compelling finding is that the emulator can be trained in one experimental setting and transferred successfully to predict behavior in a different setting.

ID HEALTH; BIAS; PREDICTION; STATE
AB Objective: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in health care to aid clinical decisions is widespread. However, as AI and ML take important roles in health care, there are concerns about AI and ML associated fairness and bias. That is, an AI tool may have a disparate impact, with its benefits and drawbacks unevenly distributed across societal strata and subpopulations, potentially exacerbating existing health inequities. Thus, the objectives of this scoping review were to summarize existing literature and identify gaps in the topic of tackling algorithmic bias and optimizing fairness in AI/ML models using real -world data (RWD) in health care domains. Methods: We conducted a thorough review of techniques for assessing and optimizing AI/ML model fairness in health care when using RWD in health care domains. The focus lies on appraising different quantification metrics for accessing fairness, publicly accessible datasets for ML fairness research, and bias mitigation approaches. Results: We identified 11 papers that are focused on optimizing model fairness in health care applications. The current research on mitigating bias issues in RWD is limited, both in terms of disease variety and health care applications, as well as the accessibility of public datasets for ML fairness research. Existing studies often indicate positive outcomes when using pre-processing techniques to address algorithmic bias. There remain unresolved questions within the field that require further research, which includes pinpointing the root causes of bias in ML models, broadening fairness research in AI/ML with the use of RWD and exploring its implications in healthcare settings, and evaluating and addressing bias in multi -modal data. Conclusion: This paper provides useful reference material and insights to researchers regarding AI/ML fairness in real -world health care data and reveals the gaps in the field. Fair AI/ML in health care is a burgeoning field that requires a heightened research focus to cover diverse applications and different types of RWD.

DE Thyroid nodule; Frozen section; Whole slide image; Deep learning;

AB Frozen sections provide a basis for rapid intraoperative diagnosis that can guide surgery, but the diagnoses often challenge pathologists. Here we propose a rule-based system to differentiate thyroid nodules from intraoperative frozen sections using deep learning techniques. The proposed system consists of three components: (1) automatically locating tissue regions in the whole slide images (WSIs), (2) splitting located tissue regions into patches and classifying each patch into predefined categories using convolutional neural networks (CNN), and (3) integrating predictions of all patches to form the final diagnosis with a rule-based system. To be specific, we fine-tune the InceptionV3 model for thyroid patch classification by replacing the last fully connected layer with three outputs representing the patch's probabilities of being benign, uncertain, or malignant. Moreover, we design a rule-based protocol to integrate patches' predictions to form the final diagnosis, which provides interpretability for the proposed system. On 259 testing slides, the system correctly predicts 95.3% (61/64) of benign nodules and 96.7% (148/153) of malignant nodules, and classify 16.2% (42/259) slides as uncertain, including 19 benign and 16 malignant slides, which are a sufficiently small number to be manually examined by pathologists or fully processed through permanent sections. Besides, the system allows the localization of suspicious regions along with the diagnosis. A typical whole slide image, with 80, 000 x 60, 000 pixels, can be diagnosed within 1 min, thus satisfying the time requirement for intraoperative diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply deep learning to diagnose thyroid nodules from intraoperative frozen sections.

AB Big Data refers to the growing challenge of turning massive, often unstructured datasets into meaningful, organized, and actionable data. As datasets grow from petabytes to exabytes and beyond, it becomes increasingly difficult to run advanced analytics, especially Machine Learning (ML) applications, in a reasonable time and on a practical power budget using traditional architectures. Previous work has focused on accelerating analytics readily implemented as SQL queries on data-parallel platforms, generally using off-the-shelf CPUs and General Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs) for computation or acceleration. However, these systems are general-purpose and still require a vast amount of data transfer between the storage devices and computing elements, thus limiting the system efficiency. As an alternative, this article presents a reconfigurable memory-centric advanced analytics accelerator that operates at the last level of memory and dramatically reduces energy required for data transfer. We functionally validate the framework using an FPGA-based hardware emulation platform and three representative applications: Naive Bayesian Classification, Convolutional Neural Networks, and k-Means Clustering. Results are compared with implementations on a modern CPU and workstation GPGPU. Finally, the use of in-memory dataset decompression to further reduce data transfer volume is investigated. With these techniques, the system achieves an average energy efficiency improvement of 74x and 212x over GPU and single-threaded CPU, respectively, while dataset compression is shown to improve overall efficiency by an additional 1.8x on average.

TI Evaluation of a machine learning tool to screen for hypoadrenocorticism
   in dogs presenting to a teaching hospital
SO JOURNAL OF VETERINARY INTERNAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE ACTH; Addison's disease; artificial intelligence; cortisol
AB Background: Dogs with hypoadrenocorticism (HA) have clinical signs and clinicopathologic abnormalities that can be mistaken as other diseases. In dogs with a differential diagnosis of HA, a machine learning model (MLM) has been validated to discriminate between HA and other diseases. This MLM has not been evaluated as a screening tool for a broader group of dogs.
   Hypothesis: An MLM can accurately screen dogs for HA.
   Animals: Dogs (n = 1025) examined at a veterinary hospital.
   Methods: Dogs that presented to a tertiary referral hospital that had a CBC and serum chemistry panel were enrolled. A trained MLM was applied to clinicopathologic data and in dogs that were MLM positive for HA, diagnosis was confirmed by measurement of serum cortisol.
   Results: Twelve dogs were MLM positive for HA and had further cortisol testing. Five had HA confirmed (true positive), 4 of which were treated for mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid deficiency, and 1 was treated for glucocorticoid deficiency alone. Three MLM positive dogs had baseline cortisol >= 2 mu g/dL but were euthanized or administered glucocorticoid treatment without confirming the diagnosis with an ACTH-stimulation test (classified as "undetermined"), and in 4, HA was ruled out (false positives). The positive likelihood ratio of the MLM was 145 to 254. All dogs diagnosed with HA by attending clinicians tested positive by the MLM.
   Conclusions and Clinical Importance: This MLM can robustly predict HA status when indiscriminately screening all dogs with blood work. In this group of dogs with a low prevalence of HA, the false positive rates were clinically acceptable.

AB Premise of the Study Phenological annotation models computed on large-scale herbarium data sets were developed and tested in this study. Methods Herbarium specimens represent a significant resource with which to study plant phenology. Nevertheless, phenological annotation of herbarium specimens is time-consuming, requires substantial human investment, and is difficult to mobilize at large taxonomic scales. We created and evaluated new methods based on deep learning techniques to automate annotation of phenological stages and tested these methods on four herbarium data sets representing temperate, tropical, and equatorial American floras. Results Deep learning allowed correct detection of fertile material with an accuracy of 96.3%. Accuracy was slightly decreased for finer-scale information (84.3% for flower and 80.5% for fruit detection). Discussion The method described has the potential to allow fine-grained phenological annotation of herbarium specimens at large ecological scales. Deeper investigation regarding the taxonomic scalability of this approach is needed.

AB Modeling systems from collected data faces two main difficulties: the first one concerns the choice of measurable variables that will define the learnt model features, which should be the ones concerned by the addressed physics, optimally neither more nor less than the essential ones. The second one is linked to accessibility to data since, generally, only limited parts of the system are accessible to perform measurements. This work revisits some aspects related to the observation, description, and modeling of systems that are only partially accessible and shows that a model can be defined when the loading in unresolved degrees of freedom remains unaltered in the different experiments.

TI Pharmacists' perceptions of artificial intelligence: A national survey
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing and evolving field impacting pharmacy research, education, and professional practice. The development and adaptation of AI technologies have the potential to radically shape the future of the pharmacy profession. However, it remains unclear how aware pharmacists are of these technologies or their perceptions regarding current and future utilization. Objective: The purpose of this study is to describe the perceptions and awareness of artificial intelligence technologies in a population of practicing pharmacists across the United States. Methods: A 19-question electronic survey was administered via Qualtrics to assess various AI perceptions among U.S. pharmacists. The survey ran from September 5th to November 22nd, 2023 and targeted practicing pharmacists through professional organizations and publicly available email lists. Responses were analyzed for descriptive trends and demographic analysis focusing on factors predicting AI use and were categorized into sub-focuses for detailed analysis. Results: A total of 1363 practicing pharmacists completed the survey. 82.5% of respondents expressed some degree of familiarity with AI software, but only 38.7% reported having used AI. Of those using AI software, the most common applications were Large Language Models (33.7%) and Image Generation (10%). 56.1% of pharmacists feel that AI will decrease the number of pharmacy jobs, and 34.9% of pharmacists express some degree of distrust of AI. Despite this, 64.1% of pharmacists feel that AI could enhance their professional effectiveness and productivity. Males appear much more likely than females to use AI (50.1% Vs. 31%, P < .001). Younger responders also reported higher AI utilization with the highest utilization aged 23e29 (47.5%) and lowest in 60 & thorn; (25.6%, P < .001) Conclusion: Understanding pharmacists' current awareness, concerns, and perspectives on AI is crucial for navigating its potential impact on the profession including potential professional utilization, addressing concerns regarding job security, ethical considerations, and regulatory uncertainty.

AB The rapid growth of deep learning (DL) has raised serious concerns about users' data and neural network (NN) models' security and privacy, particularly the risk of backdoor insertion when outsourcing the training or employing pre-trained models. To ensure resilience against such backdoor attacks, this work presents GuardianMPC, a novel framework leveraging secure multiparty computation (MPC). GuardianMPC is built upon garbled circuits (GC) within the LEGO protocol framework to accelerate oblivious inference on FPGAs in the presence of malicious adversaries that can manipulate the model weights and/or insert a backdoor in the architecture of a pre-trained model. In this regard, GuardianMPC is the first to offer private function evaluation in the LEGO family. GuardianMPC also supports private training to effectively counter backdoor attacks targeting NN model architectures and parameters. With optimized pre-processing, GuardianMPC significantly accelerates the online phase, achieving up to $13.44\times $ faster computation than its software counterparts. Our experimental results for multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) assess GuardianMPC's time complexity and scalability across diverse NN model architectures. Interestingly, GuardianMPC does not adversely affect the training accuracy, as opposed to many existing private training frameworks. These results confirm GuardianMPC as a high-performance, model-agnostic solution for secure NN computation with robust security and privacy guarantees.

AB As the ubiquity and complexity of system-on-chip (SoC) designs increase across electronic devices, incorporating security into an SoC design flow poses significant challenges. Existing security solutions are inadequate to effectively verify modern SoC designs due to their limitations in scalability, comprehensiveness, and adaptability. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) are celebrated for their remarkable success in language understanding, advanced reasoning, and program synthesis tasks. Recognizing an opportunity, our research explores leveraging the emergent capabilities of generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) to address the existing gaps in SoC security, aiming for a more efficient, scalable, and adaptable methodology. By integrating LLMs into the SoC security verification paradigm, we open a new frontier of possibilities and challenges to ensure the security of increasingly complex SoCs. This paper offers an in-depth analysis of existing works, presents practical case studies, and demonstrates comprehensive experiments. We also present the achievements, prospects, and challenges of employing LLM in different SoC security verification tasks.

AB Today's acoustic monitoring devices are capable of recording and storing tremendous amounts of data. Until recently, the classification of animal vocalizations from field recordings has been relegated to qualitative approaches. For large-scale acoustic monitoring studies, qualitative approaches are very time-consuming and suffer from the bias of subjectivity. Recent developments in supervised learning techniques can provide rapid, accurate, species-level classification of bioacoustics data. We compared the classification performances of four supervised learning techniques (random forests, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and discriminant function analysis) for five different classification tasks using bat echolocation calls recorded by a popular frequency-division bat detector. We found that all classifiers performed similarly in terms of overall accuracy with the exception of discriminant function analysis, which had the lowest average performance metrics. Random forests had the advantage of high sensitivities, specificities, and predictive powers across the majority of classification tasks, and also provided metrics for determining the relative importance of call features in distinguishing between groups. Overall classification accuracy for each task was slightly lower than reported accuracies using calls recorded by time-expansion detectors. Myotis spp. were particularly difficult to separate; classifiers performed best when members of this genus were combined in genus-level classification and analyzed separately at the level of species. Additionally, we identified and ranked the relative contributions of all predictor features to classifier accuracy and found measurements of frequency, total call duration, and characteristic slope to be the most important contributors to classification success. We provide recommendations to maximize accuracy and efficiency when analyzing acoustic data, and suggest an application of automated bioacoustics monitoring to contribute to wildlife monitoring efforts.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed society in many ways. AI in medicine has the potential to improve medical care and reduce healthcare professional burnout but we must be cautious of a phenomenon termed "AI hallucinations" and how this term can lead to the stigmatization of AI systems and persons who experience hallucinations. We believe the term "AI misinformation" to be more appropriate and avoids contributing to stigmatization. Healthcare professionals can play an important role in AI's integration into medicine, especially regarding mental health services, so it is important that we continue to critically evaluate AI systems as they emerge.

AB Classical demand modeling analyzes travel behavior using only low-dimensional numeric data (i.e. sociodemographics and travel attributes) but not high-dimensional urban imagery. However, travel behavior depends on the factors represented by both numeric data and urban imagery, thus necessitating a synergetic framework to combine them. This study creates a theoretical framework of deep hybrid models consisting of a mixing operator and a behavioral predictor, thus integrating the numeric and imagery data for travel behavior analysis. Empiri-cally, this framework is applied to analyze travel mode choice using the Chicago MyDailyTravel Survey as the numeric inputs and the satellite images as the imagery inputs. We found that deep hybrid models significantly outperform both classical demand models and deep learning models in predicting aggregate and disaggregate travel behavior. The deep hybrid models can reveal spatial clusters with meaningful sociodemographic associations in the latent space. The models can also generate new satellite images that do not exist in reality and compute the corresponding economic information, such as substitution patterns and social welfare. Overall, the deep hybrid models demonstrate the complementarity between the low-dimensional numeric and high-dimensional imagery data and between the traditional demand modeling and recent deep learning. They enrich the family of hybrid demand models by using deep architecture as the latent space and enabling researchers to conduct associative analysis for sociodemographics, travel decisions, and generated satellite imagery. Future research could address the limitations in interpretability, robustness, and transferability, and propose new methods to further enrich the deep hybrid models.

AB Human-robot collaboration has gained popularity in various construction applications. The key to a successful human-robot collaboration at the same construction workplace is the delicate algorithm for predicting human motions to strengthen the robot's situational awareness, i.e., robot-human awareness. Most existing approaches have focused on predicting human motions based on repetitive patterns of human behaviors in well-defined task contexts, such as specific object picking tasks, for a relatively short period of time. These methods can hardly capture the "pattern inconsistency" of human actions, i.e., the differences across people in terms of motion features and even for the same person at different time points of the task. This paper proposes an analytical pipeline that segments and clusters the human inconsistent behaviors into different pattern groups and builds separate human motion pattern prediction models correspondingly. The proposed method, Human Motion Feature Grouping and Prediction (HMFGP), quantifies the spatiotemporal relationship between gaze focus and hand movement trajectories, segments the raw data based on the detected gaze-hand relationship pattern changes, and clusters the matched gaze-hand data segments into several pattern groups based on the pattern similarity of the gaze-hand relationships. Then a time series Deep Learning method is used to predict hand motions based on gaze focus trajectories for each of the pattern groups. The gaze and hand motion data of a human subject experiment (n = 120) for pipe skid maintenance was used to test the prediction performance of HMFGP. The result shows that HMFGP can significantly improve the accuracy of human hand motion prediction and help quantity different patterns of human motions for specific analyses.

AB Modeling plant canopy biophysical parameters at the individual plant level remains a major challenge. This study presents a workflow for automatic strawberry canopy delineation and biomass prediction from high-resolution images using deep neural networks. High-resolution (5 mm) RGB orthoimages, near-infrared (NIR) orthoimages, and Digital Surface Models (DSM), which were generated by Structure from Motion (SfM), were utilized in this study. Mask R-CNN was applied to the orthoimages of two band combinations (RGB and RGB-NIR) to identify and delineate strawberry plant canopies. The average detection precision rate and recall rate were 97.28% and 99.71% for RGB images and 99.13% and 99.54% for RGB-NIR images, and the mean intersection over union (mIoU) rates for instance segmentation were 98.32% and 98.45% for RGB and RGB-NIR images, respectively. Based on the center of the canopy mask, we imported the cropped RGB, NIR, DSM, and mask images of individual plants to vanilla deep regression models to model canopy leaf area and dry biomass. Two networks (VGG-16 and ResNet-50) were used as the backbone architecture for feature map extraction. The R-2 values of dry biomass models were about 0.76 and 0.79 for the VGG-16 and ResNet-50 networks, respectively. Similarly, the R-2 values of leaf area were 0.82 and 0.84, respectively. The RMSE values were approximately 8.31 and 8.73 g for dry biomass analyzed using the VGG-16 and ResNet-50 networks, respectively. Leaf area RMSE was 0.05m(2) for both networks. This work demonstrates the feasibility of deep learning networks in individual strawberry plant extraction and biomass estimation.

AB In hyperspectral unmixing, the prevalent model used is the linear mixing model, and a large variety of techniques based on this model has been proposed to obtain endmembers and their abundances in hyperspectral imagery. However, it has been known for some time that nonlinear spectral mixing effects can be a crucial component in many real-world scenarios, such as planetary remote sensing, intimate mineral mixtures, vegetation canopies, or urban scenes. While several nonlinear mixing models have been proposed decades ago, only recently there has been a proliferation of nonlinear unmixing models and techniques in the signal processing literature. This paper aims to give an historical overview of the majority of nonlinear mixing models and nonlinear unmixing methods, and to explain some of the more popular techniques in detail. The main models and techniques treated are bilinear models, models for intimate mineral mixtures, radiosity-based approaches, ray tracing, neural networks, kernel methods, support vector machine techniques, manifold learning methods, piece-wise linear techniques, and detection methods for nonlinearity. Furthermore, we provide an overview of several recent developments in the nonlinear unmixing literature that do not belong into any of these categories.

AB As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to embed itself in our daily lives, many focus on the threats it poses to privacy, security, due process, and democracy itself But beyond these legitimate concerns, AI promises to optimize activities, increase efficiency, and enhance the accuracy and efficacy of the many aspects of society relying on predictions and likelihoods. In short, its most promising applications may come, not from uses affecting civil liberties and the social fabric of our society, but from those particularly complex technical problems lying beyond our ready human capacity. Climate change is one such complex problem, requiring fundamental changes to our transportation, agricultural, building, and energy sectors. This Article argues for the enhanced use of AI to address climate change, using the energy sector to exemplify its potential promise and pitfalls. The Article then analyzes critical policy tradeoffs that may be associated with an increased use of AI and argues for its disciplined use in a way that minimizes its limitations while harnessing its benefits to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.

AB The landscape of medical treatments is undergoing a transformative shift. Precision medicine has ushered in a revolutionary era in healthcare by individualizing diagnostics and treatments according to each patient's uniquely evolving health status. This groundbreaking method of tailoring disease prevention and treatment considers individual variations in genes, environments, and lifestyles. The goal of precision medicine is to target the "five rights": the right patient, the right drug, the right time, the right dose, and the right route. In this pursuit, in silico techniques have emerged as an anchor, driving precision medicine forward and making this a realistic and promising avenue for personalized therapies. With the advancements in high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies, genomic data, including genetic variants and their interactions with each other and the environment, can be incorporated into clinical decision-making. Pharmacometrics, gathering pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data, and mathematical models further contribute to drug optimization, drug behavior prediction, and drug-drug interaction identification. Digital health, wearables, and computational tools offer continuous monitoring and real-time data collection, enabling treatment adjustments. Furthermore, the incorporation of extensive datasets in computational tools, such as electronic health records (EHRs) and omics data, is also another pathway to acquire meaningful information in this field. Although they are fairly new, machine learning (ML) algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are also resources researchers use to analyze big data and develop predictive models. This review explores the interplay of these multiple in silico approaches in advancing precision medicine and fostering individual healthcare. Despite intrinsic challenges, such as ethical considerations, data protection, and the need for more comprehensive research, this marks a new era of patient-centered healthcare. Innovative in silico techniques hold the potential to reshape the future of medicine for generations to come.

AB Image stitching involves combining multiple images of the same scene captured from different viewpoints into a single image with an expanded field of view. While this technique has various applications in computer vision, traditional methods rely on the successive stitching of image pairs taken from multiple cameras. While this approach is effective for organized camera arrays, it can pose challenges for unstructured ones, especially when handling scene overlaps. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach for stitching images from large unstructured camera sets covering complex scenes. Our method processes images concurrently by using the SandFall algorithm to transform data from multiple cameras into a reduced fixed array, thereby minimizing data loss. A customized convolutional neural network then processes these data to produce the final image. By stitching images simultaneously, our method avoids the potential cascading errors seen in sequential pairwise stitching while offering improved time efficiency. In addition, we detail an unsupervised training method for the network utilizing metrics from Generative Adversarial Networks supplemented with supervised learning. Our testing revealed that the proposed approach operates in roughly similar to 1/7th the time of many traditional methods on both CPU and GPU platforms, achieving results consistent with established methods.

TI IMPROVING CLOUD GAMING EXPERIENCE THROUGH MOBILE EDGE COMPUTING
SO IEEE WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
AB With the development of 4G/5G technology and smart devices, more and more users begin to play games via their mobile devices. As a promising way to enable users to play any games, cloud gaming is proposed to stream game scene rendered remotely in the cloud with the format of video. However, it faces major challenges in terms of long delay and high network bandwidth. To this end, a novel framework named EdgeGame is proposed to improve the cloud gaming experience by leveraging resources in the edge. Compared to existing cloud gaming systems, EdgeGame offloads the computation-intensive rendering to the network edge instead, which can reduce network delay and bandwidth consumption greatly. Moreover, EdgeGame introduces deep reinforcement learning in the edge to adjust the video bitrates adaptively to accommodate the network dynamics. Finally, we implemented a prototype system and compared it with an existing cloud gaming system.

AB Short-term prediction of urban air quality is critical to pollution management and public health. However, existing studies have failed to make full use of the spatiotemporal correlations or topological relationships among air quality monitoring networks (AQMN), and hence exhibit low precision in regional prediction tasks. With this consideration, we proposed a novel deep learning-based hybrid model of Res-GCN-BiLSTM combining the residual neural network (ResNet), graph convolutional network (GCN), and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), for predicting short-term regional NO2 and O3 concentrations. Auto-correlation analysis and cluster analysis were first utilized to reveal the inherent temporal and spatial properties respectively. They demonstrated that there existed temporal daily periodicity and spatial similarity in AQMN. Then the identified spatiotemporal properties were sufficiently leveraged, and monitoring network topological information, as well as auxiliary pollutants and meteorology were also adaptively integrated into the model. The hourly observed data from 51 air quality monitoring stations and meteorological data in Shanghai were employed to evaluate it. Results show that the Res-GCN-BiLSTM model was better adapted to the pollutant characteristics and improved the prediction accuracy, with nearly 11% and 17% improvements in mean absolute error for NO2 and O3, respectively compared to the best performing baseline model. Among the three types of monitoring stations, traffic monitoring stations performed the best for O3, but the worst for NO2, mainly due to the impacts of intensive traffic emissions and the titration reaction. These findings illustrate that the hybrid architecture is more suitable for regional pollutant concentration.

AB Computational drug design relies on the calculation of binding strength between two biological counterparts especially a chemical compound, i.e., a ligand, and a protein. Predicting the affinity of protein-ligand binding with reasonable accuracy is crucial for drug discovery, and enables the optimization of compounds to achieve better interaction with their target protein. In this paper, we propose a data-driven framework named DeepAtom to accurately predict the protein-ligand binding affinity. With 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN) architecture, DeepAtom could automatically extract binding related atomic interaction patterns from the voxelized complex structure. Compared with the other CNN based approaches, our light-weight model design effectively improves the model representational capacity, even with the limited available training data. We carried out validation experiments on the PDBbind v.2016 benchmark and the independent Astex Diverse Set. We demonstrate that the less feature engineering dependent DeepAtom approach consistently outperforms the other baseline scoring methods. We also compile and propose a new benchmark dataset to further improve the model performances. With the new dataset as training input, DeepAtom achieves Pearson's R=0.83 and RMSE=1.23 pK units on the PDBbind v.2016 core set. The promising results demonstrate that DeepAtom models can be potentially adopted in computational drug development protocols such as molecular docking and virtual screening.

AB Although numerous studies have attempted to understand the causes of various forms of police misconduct, there is still no clear theoretical explanation of police misbehavior. Akers' social learning theory posits that peer associations, attitudes, reinforcement, and modeling are predictors of delinquency and crime in general. With this article, we seek to determine if the theory can account for police deviance. Data from a random sample of Philadelphia police officers are used to examine how officer attitudes and perceptions of peer behavior are related to citizen complaints of police misconduct. Findings suggest that social learning theory provides a useful explanation of police misconduct.

ID STATE RESTORATION; SILICON
AB A key problem in postsilicon validation is to identify a small set of traceable signals that are effective for debug during silicon execution. Structural analysis used by traditional signal selection techniques leads to a poor restoration quality. In contrast, simulation-based selection techniques provide superior restorability but incur significant computation overhead. In this paper, we propose an efficient signal selection technique using machine learning to take advantage of simulation-based signal selection while significantly reducing the simulation overhead. The basic idea is to train a machine learning framework with a few simulation runs and utilize its effective prediction capability (instead of expensive simulation) to identify beneficial trace signals. Specifically, our approach uses: 1) bounded mock simulations to generate training vectors for the machine learning technique and 2) a compound search-space exploration approach to identify the most profitable signals. Experimental results indicate that our approach can improve restorability by up to 143.1% (29.2% on average) while maintaining or improving runtime compared with the state-of-the-art signal selection techniques.

AB Deep convolutional neural networks offer state-of-the-art performance for medical image analysis. However, their architectures are manually designed for particular problems. On the one hand, a manual designing process requires many trials to tune a large number of hyperparameters and is thus quite a time-consuming task. On the other hand, the fittest hyperparameters that can adapt to source data properties (e.g., sparsity, noisy features) are not able to be quickly identified for target data properties. For instance, the realistic noise in medical images is usually mixed and complicated, and sometimes unknown, leading to challenges in applying existing methods directly and creating effective denoising neural networks easily. In this paper, we present a Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based network evolution approach to search for the fittest genes to optimize network structures automatically. We expedite the evolutionary process through an experience-based greedy exploration strategy and transfer learning. Our evolutionary algorithm procedure has flexibility, which allows taking advantage of current state-of-the-art modules (e.g., residual blocks) to search for promising neural networks. We evaluate our framework on a classic medical image analysis task: denoising. The experimental results on computed tomography perfusion (CTP) image denoising demonstrate the capability of the method to select the fittest genes for building high-performance networks, named EvoNets. Our results outperform state-of-the-art methods consistently at various noise levels. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose The use of the ionization chamber array ICProfiler (ICP) is limited by its relatively poor detector spatial resolution and the inherent volume averaging effect (VAE). The purpose of this work is to study the feasibility of reconstructing VAE-free continuous photon beam profiles from ICP measurements with a machine learning technique. Methods In- and cross-plane photon beam profiles of a 6 MV beam from an Elekta linear accelerator, ranging from 2 x 2 to 10 x 10 cm(2) at 1.5 cm, 5 cm, and 10 cm depth, were measured with an ICP. The discrete measurements were interpolated with a Makima method to obtain continuous beam profiles. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) were trained to restore the penumbra of the beam profiles. Plane-specific (in- and cr-plane) ANNs and a combined ANN were separately trained. The performance of the ANNs was evaluated using the penumbra width difference (PWD, the difference between the penumbra widths of the reconstructed and the reference profile). The plane-specific and the combined ANNs were compared to study the feasibility of using a single ANN for both in- and cross-plane. Results The profiles reconstructed with all the ANNs had excellent agreement with the reference. For in-plane, the ANNs reduced the PWD from 1.6 +/- 0.7 mm at 1.5 cm depth to 0.1 +/- 0.1 mm, from 1.8 +/- 0.6 mm at 5.0 cm depth to 0.1 +/- 0.1 mm, and from 2.4 +/- 0.1 mm at 10.0 cm depth to 0.0 +/- 0.0 mm; for cross-plane, the ANNs reduced the PWD from 1.2 +/- 0.4 mm at 1.5 cm depth, 1.2 +/- 0.3 mm at 5.0 cm depth, and 1.6 +/- 0.1 mm at 10.0 cm depth, to 0.1 +/- 0.1 mm. Conclusions This study demonstrated the feasibility of using simple ANNs to reconstruct VAE-free continuous photon beam profiles from discrete ICP measurements. A combined ANN can restore the penumbra of in- and cross-plane beam profiles of various fields at different depths.

AB We model the role played by the Basal Ganglia (BC) in the generation of voluntary saccadic eye movements. The BG model explicitly represents key nuclei like the striatum (caudate), Substantia Nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and compata (SNc), the Subthalamic Nucleus (STN), the two pallidal nuclei and Superior Colliculus. The model is cast within the Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, with the dopamine representing the temporal difference error, the striatum serving as the critic, and the indirect pathway playing the role of the explorer. Performance of the model is evaluated on a set of tasks such as feature and conjunction searches, directional selectivity and a successive saccade task. Behavioral phenomena such as independence of search time on number of distractors in feature search and linear increase in search time with number of distractors in conjunction search are observed. It is also seen that saccadic reaction times are longer and search efficiency is impaired on diminished BC contribution, which corroborates with reported data obtained from Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients.

ID DIAGNOSIS
AB Liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B is the pathological repair response of the liver to chronic injury, which is a key step in the development of various chronic liver diseases to cirrhosis and an important link affecting the prognosis of chronic liver diseases. The further development of liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B can lead to the disorder of hepatic lobule structure, nodular regeneration of hepatocytes, formation of a pseudolobular structure, namely, cirrhosis, clinical manifestations of liver dysfunction, and portal hypertension. So far, the diagnosis of liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B has been made manually by doctors. However, this is very subjective and boring for doctors. Doctors are likely to be interfered with by external factors, such as fatigue and lack of sleep. This paper proposed a 5-layer deep convolution neural network structure for the automatic classification of liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis B. In the 5-layer deep convolution neural network structure, there were three convolution layers and two fully connected layers, and each convolution layer was connected with a pooling layer. 123 ADC images were collected, and the following results were obtained: the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1, MCC, and FMI were 88.13%+/- 1.47%, 81.45%+/- 3.69%, 91.12%+/- 1.72%, 80.49%+/- 2.94%, 80.90%+/- 2.39%, 72.36%+/- 3.39%, and 80.94%+/- 2.37%, respectively.

AB Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely adopted in intelligent systems with unprecedented accuracy but at the cost of a substantial amount of data movement. Although the emerging processing-in-memory (PIM) architecture seeks to minimize data movement by placing memory near processing elements, memory is still the major bottleneck in the entire system. The selection of hyper-parameters in the training of CNN applications requires over hundreds of kilobytes cache capacity for concurrent processing of convolutions. How to jointly explore the computation capability of the PIM architecture and the highly parallel property of neural networks remains a critical issue. This paper presents Para-Net, that exploits Parallelism for deterministic convolutional neural Networks on the PIM architecture. Para-Net achieves data-level parallelism for convolutions by fully utilizing the on-chip processing engine (PE) in PIM. The objective is to capture the characteristics of neural networks and present a hardware-independent design to jointly optimize the scheduling of both intermediate results and computation tasks. We formulate this data allocation problem as a dynamic programming model and obtain an optimal solution. To demonstrate the viability of the proposed Para-Net, we conduct a set of experiments using a variety of realistic CNN applications. The graph abstractions are obtained from deep learning framework Caffe. Experimental results show that Para-Net can significantly reduce processing time and improve cache efficiency compared to representative schemes.

ID IMPACT; BIAS
AB Machine Learning has become a popular tool in a variety of applications in criminal justice, including sentencing and policing. Media has brought attention to the possibility of predictive policing systems causing disparate impacts and exacerbating social injustices. However, there is little academic research on the importance of fairness in machine learning applications in policing. Although prior research has shown that machine learning models can handle some tasks efficiently, they are susceptible to replicating systemic bias of previous human decision-makers. While there is much research on fair machine learning in general, there is a need to investigate fair machine learning techniques as they pertain to the predictive policing. Therefore, we evaluate the existing publications in the field of fairness in machine learning and predictive policing to arrive at a set of standards for fair predictive policing. We also review the evaluations of ML applications in the area of criminal justice and potential techniques to improve these technologies going forward. We urge that the growing literature on fairness in ML be brought into conversation with the legal and social science concerns being raised about predictive policing. Lastly, in any area, including predictive policing, the pros and cons of the technology need to be evaluated holistically to determine whether and how the technology should be used in policing.

AB Theoretical physicists describe nature by i) building a theory model and ii) determining the model parameters. The latter step involves the dual aspect of both fitting to the existing experimental data and satisfying abstract criteria like beauty, naturalness, etc. We use the Yukawa quark sector as a toy example to demonstrate how both of those tasks can be accomplished with machine learning techniques. We propose loss functions whose minimization results in true models that are also beautiful as measured by three different criteria - uniformity, sparsity, or symmetry.

AB IMPORTANCE Current approaches to identifying individuals at high risk for opioid overdose target many patients who are not truly at high risk.
   OBJECTIVE To develop and validate a machine-learning algorithm to predict opioid overdose risk among Medicare beneficiaries with at least 1 opioid prescription.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prognostic study was conducted between September 1, 2017, and December 31, 2018. Participants (n = 560 057) included fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries without cancer who filled 1 or more opioid prescriptions from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2015. Beneficiaries were randomly and equally divided into training, testing, and validation samples.
   EXPOSURES Potential predictors (n = 268), including sociodemographics, health status, patterns of opioid use, and practitioner-level and regional-level factors, were measured in 3-month windows, starting 3 months before initiating opioids until loss of follow-up or the end of observation.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Opioid overdose episodes from inpatient and emergency department claims were identified. Multivariate logistic regression (MLR), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-type regression (LASSO), random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and deep neural network (DNN) were applied to predict overdose risk in the subsequent 3 months after initiation of treatment with prescription opioids. Prediction performance was assessed using the C statistic and other metrics (eg, sensitivity, specificity, and number needed to evaluate [NNE] to identify one overdose). The Youden index was used to identify the optimized threshold of predicted score that balanced sensitivity and specificity.
   RESULTS Beneficiaries in the training (n = 186 686), testing (n = 186 685), and validation (n = 186 686) samples had similar characteristics (mean [SD] age of 68.0 [14.5] years, and approximately 63% were female, 82% were white, 35% had disabilities, 41% were dual eligible, and 0.60% had at least 1 overdose episode). In the validation sample, the DNN (C statistic = 0.91; 95% CI, 0.88-0.93) and GBM (C statistic = 0.90; 95% CI, 0.87-0.94) algorithms outperformed the LASSO (C statistic = 0.84; 95% CI, 0.80-0.89), RF (C statistic = 0.80; 95% CI, 0.75-0.84), and MLR (C statistic = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.69-0.80) methods for predicting opioid overdose. At the optimized sensitivity and specificity, DNN had a sensitivity of 92.3%, specificity of 75.7%, NNE of 542, positive predictive value of 0.18%, and negative predictive value of 99.9%. The DNN classified patients into low-risk (76.2%[142 180] of the cohort), medium-risk (18.6%[34 579] of the cohort), and high-risk (5.2%[9747] of the cohort) subgroups, with only 1 in 10 000 in the low-risk subgroup having an overdose episode. More than 90% of overdose episodes occurred in the high-risk and medium-risk subgroups, although positive predictive values were low, given the rare overdose outcome.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Machine-learning algorithms appear to perform well for risk prediction and stratification of opioid overdose, especially in identifying low-risk subgroups that have minimal risk of overdose.

AB In this systematic review, we synthesize ten empirical peer-reviewed articles published between 2019 and 2023 that used generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) for automated feedback in higher education. There are significant opportunities and challenges to integrate these tools effectively into learning environments as the demand for timely and personalized feedback grows. We examine the articles based on instructional contexts and system characteristics, identifying critical implementation possibilities for GenAI in automated feedback. Our findings reveal that GenAI provides diverse feedback across various contexts with multiple instructional purposes. GenAI systems can reduce instructor workload by automating routine grading and feedback tasks, allowing educators to focus on more complex teaching responsibilities with augmented capabilities. Additionally, these systems enhance communication, offer cognitive and emotional support, and improve accessibility by creating supportive, stress-free learning environments. Overall, implementing GenAI automated feedback systems improves educational outcomes and creates a more efficient and supportive learning environment for students and instructors. We conclude with future research directions to better integrate GenAI with human instruction by reconsidering instructors' roles, especially in providing feedback to create more effective educational experiences.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB As opportunities for artificial intelligence to augment surgical care expand, the accompanying surge in published literature has generated both substantial enthusiasm and grave concern regarding the safety and efficacy of artificial intelligence in surgery. For surgeons and surgical data scientists, it is increasingly important to understand the state-of-the-art, recognize knowledge and technology gaps, and critically evaluate the deluge of literature accordingly. This article summarizes the experiences and perspectives of a global, multi-disciplinary group of experts who have faced development and implementation challenges, overcome them, and produced incipient evidence thereof. Collectively, evidence suggests that artificial intelligence has the potential to augment surgeons via decision-support, technical skill assessment, and the semi-autonomous performance of tasks ranging from resource allocation to patching foregut defects. Most applications remain in preclinical phases. As technologies and their implementations improve and positive evidence accumulates, surgeons will face professional imperatives to lead the safe, effective clinical implementation of artificial intelligence in surgery. Substantial challenges remain; recent progress in using artificial intelligence to achieve performance advantages in surgery suggests that remaining challenges can and will be overcome.

AB As the device size scalesdown to the nanometer regime, quantum effects play an important role in device characteristicsand performance. Quantum transport device simulation based on the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) has been extensively applied to simulate the nanoscaledevices. TheNEGF simulations, however, can be computationally expensive, especially in the presence of scattering. In this study, a machine learning (ML)-based framework is developed, targeting on replacing the computationally intensive NEGF simulations. This framework first learns a sparse representation of a quantum transport property of interest and then trains a model to describe the quantitative mapping relation between the device parameters and properties. Also, the accuracy is further improved with the application of feature engineering. As an example, a graphene-ferroelectric-metal (GFM) ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) is simulated. The results show that the ML-based framework allows circumventing the NEGF calculation and simultaneously maintaining high accuracy in quantum transmissions and tunneling I - V characteristics. This ML-based framework can be applied to speed up the quantum transport device simulations and enable efficient tunneling device design.

AB Molecular dynamics modeling is a useful tool to study the interface physics of the clay-water system at the nanoscale. A key parameter to characterize the interface physics of unsaturated soils is the contact angle between clay and water. In this paper, we propose a deep-learning enhanced numerical method to accurately determine the clay-water contact angle at elevated temperatures from molecular dynamics simulations. In this approach the water droplet on clay is treated as a 3D point cloud. The spatial location of individual water molecular is derived from the coordinate of the molecule's center-of-mass. At each point, the covariance matrix method is used to fit a tangent plane to a surface spanned by its k-nearest neighbors. The clay-water contact angle is calculated from the normal of the tangent plane. The covariance matrix method is enhanced by a deep-learning algorithm through the randomized Hough transform. Through the transform, each normal is mapped to a Hough accumulator with many bins. The final normal is obtained from the most voted bin via the deep-learning algorithm. Numerical results have demonstrated that the deep-learning enhanced algorithm is robust in characterizing variations of the contact angle between clay and water at elevated temperatures.

AB This paper investigates a two-competing group scheduling problem on serial-batching machines considering setup times and truncated job-dependent learning effects. The objective is to minimize the makespan of one group with truncated learning effect under the constraint that the makespan of the other group with general learning effect cannot exceed an upper bound. We propose some structural properties for the scheduling problem on a given machine, and design a Less-is-more-based iterative reference greedy algorithm for parallel machines scheduling problems. The computational results show that the proposed algorithm can solve the studied problems effectively.

AB In the current education field, the assessment of teaching management quality mostly relies on subjective judgment and static data, and lacks a real-time and dynamic feedback mechanism. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based human behavior analysis method, which aims to assess teaching management quality in real time by analyzing the behaviors of teachers and students in the classroom. First, in order to detect individual students in the video stream, an augmented detection framework based on YOLO v5s is introduced to process and analyze human actions and interaction patterns in the video data. Immediately after that, we design a channel residual decoupled convolutional neural network to recognize the different states of students. Teaching management quality is assessed by detecting students' classroom attention scores. By conducting experiments in different disciplines and teaching management environments to collect and train the model, the results show that the method can effectively improve the objectivity and accuracy of teaching management quality assessment.

AB To avoid unexpected failures of units in manufacturing systems, failure mode recognition and prognostics are critically important in prognostics health management (PHM). Most existing methods either ignored the effects of various failure modes on remaining useful lifetime (RUL) prediction or implemented failure mode recognition and RUL prediction as two independent tasks, which failed to exploit failure mode information to obtain accurate RUL prediction. In fact, RUL highly depends on failure modes because sensor signals under different failure modes usually present different degradation patterns. To address the issue, this paper proposes a joint learning model of failure mode recognition and RUL prediction for degradation processes based on multiple sensor signals. The proposed joint learning model first extracts features by considering the degradation mechanism to ensure good interpretability for degradation modeling, and then takes the extracted features as inputs to a deep neural network. By conducting failure mode recognition and RUL prediction as a collaborative task, the proposed model can fully characterize the complex relationship among the extracted features, RUL and failure modes, and outputs the recognized failure modes and the predicted RUL of units simultaneously. A case study on the degradation of aircraft gas turbine engines is presented to evaluate the proposed model performance. Note to Practitioners-The paper aims to develop a joint learning method for failure mode recognition and RUL prediction of operating units. Specifically, the developed method addresses a challenging issue in practice, i.e., how to effectively conduct failure mode recognition and RUL prediction as a joint task based on interpretable extracted degradation features from multiple sensor signals. To implement this method in practice, four steps are included as follows: First, collect multiple sensor signals, failure time, and failure modes of historical units. Second, construct the joint learning model based on features extracted from sensor signals by considering the degradation mechanism. Third, estimate model parameters using the data of historical units. Fourth, recognize the failure mode and predict the RUL of an in-service unit. Since the proposed method is a data-driven neural network with flexible model structure that considers complex data relationships, it is expected to be applicable to many practical situations and use cases, especially for manufacturing systems with complex structures and unknown failure thresholds.

AB Social desirability bias (SDB) is a common threat to the validity of conclusions from responses to a scale or survey. There is a wide range of person-fit statistics in the literature that can be employed to detect SDB. In addition, machine learning classifiers, such as logistic regression and random forest, have the potential to distinguish between biased and unbiased responses. This study proposes a new application of these classifiers to detect SDB by considering several person-fit indices as features or predictors in the machine learning methods. The results of a Monte Carlo simulation study showed that for a single feature, applying person-fit indices directly and logistic regression led to similar classification results. However, the random forest classifier improved the classification of biased and unbiased responses substantially. Classification was improved in both logistic regression and random forest by considering multiple features simultaneously. Moreover, cross-validation indicated stable area under the curves (AUCs) across machine learning classifiers. A didactical illustration of applying random forest to detect SDB is presented.

AB Drawing from prior literature on machine-generated news, this study examines machine-generated artworks in a cross-cultural context. It combines machine learning approaches with online experiments and investigates how different genres of artworks and different authorship cues influence participants' open-ended responses to machine-generated works. Results suggest that while genres and cultures affected participants' discussion topics and word use, the differences between participants' responses to machine-generated artworks and human-generated ones were not evident. This study tests the explanatory power of machine heuristic and demonstrates the feasibility of integrating multiple methods in future AI-based media research.

AB A disaster-resilient city should address social inequity in all its forms. Complete, accurate, and up-to-the-minute situational awareness (SA) can help disaster relief organizations stabilize the dangers and prevent further losses in poor and ethnic minority neighborhoods. However, the lapse of months or years of survey data could lead to biases since retrospective studies are affected by the emotional status at the time of the survey. To address this, we aim to examine the effects of neighborhood equity on SA in a hurricane event using geotagged Twitter data. We adopted the sentiment analysis, convolutional neural network (CNN) model and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model to reflect SA in Hurricane Florence. The multinomial logit regression model reveals that the tweet originated from a poor neighborhood has a higher probability of being more negative, compared to being neutral. Also, we surprisingly found that the sentiment of a tweet in a black neighborhood could be less likely to be negative. Another novel finding is that black neighborhoods could discuss the hurricane with a positive attitude while poor neighborhoods are more concerned about the work during the hurricane. This study shows that, by incorporating with aggregated sociodemographic data, geotagged Twitter data can also be used to understand disaster SA from the perspective of social equity.

AB Several machine learning algorithms have recently been applied to modeling the specificity of HIV-1 protease. The problem is challenging because of the three issues as follows: (1) datasets with high dimensionality and small number of samples could misguide classification modeling and its interpretation; (2) symbolic interpretation is desirable because it provides us insight to the specificity in the form of human-understandable rules, and thus helps us to design effective HIV inhibitors; (3) the interpretation should take into account complexity or dependency between positions in sequences. Therefore, it is neccessary to investigate multivariate and feature-selective methods to model the specificity and to extract rules from the model.
   We have tested extensively various machine learning methods, and we have found that the combination of neural networks and decompositional approach can generate a set of effective rules. By validation to experimental results for the HIV-1 protease, the specificity rules outperform the ones generated by frequency-based, univariate or black-box methods. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Machine Learning based data classification is a widely used data mining technique. By learning massive data collected from the real world, data classification helps learners discover hidden data patterns. These hidden data patterns are represented by the learned model in different machine learning schemes. Based on such models, a user can classify whether the new incoming data belongs to an existing class; or, multiple entities may test the similarity of their datasets. However, due to data locality and privacy concerns, it is infeasible for large-scale distributed systems to share each individual's datasets for classifying or testing. On the one hand, the learned model is an entity's private asset and may leak private information, which should be well protected from all other non-collaborative entities. On the other hand, the new incoming data may contain sensitive information which cannot be disclosed directly for classification. To address the above privacy issues, we propose an approach to preserve the model privacy of the data classification and similarity evaluation for distributed systems. With our scheme, neither new data nor learned models are directly revealed during the classification and similarity evaluation procedures. Based on extensive real-world experiments, we have evaluated the privacy preservation, feasibility, and efficiency of the proposed scheme.

AB (Aim) To detect COVID-19 patients more accurately and more precisely, we proposed a novel artificial intelligence model. (Methods) We used previously proposed chest CT dataset containing four categories: COVID-19, community-acquired pneumonia, secondary pulmonary tuberculosis, and healthy subjects. First, we proposed a novel VGG-style base network (VSBN) as backbone network. Second, convolutional block attention module (CBAM) was introduced as attention module into our VSBN. Third, an improved multiple-way data augmentation method was used to resist over-fitting of our Al model. In all, our model was dubbed as a 12-layer attention-based VGG-style network for COVID-19 (AVNC) (Results) This proposed AVNC achieved the sensitivity/precision/F1 per class all above 95%. Particularly, AVNC yielded a micro-averaged F1 score of 96.87%, which is higher than 11 state-of-the-art approaches. (Conclusion) This proposed AVNC is effective in recognizing COVID-19 diseases.

AB The energy efficiency optimization of Florida's residential buildings is essential for the reduction of fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. This optimization requires designers to accurately calculate the building energy loads at the design stage to efficiently design the cooling and heating systems. However, due to time and cost constraints, designers usually explore only a few design alternatives and simulate their energy use. This study developed an artificial-neural-network (ANN)-based generative design (GD) framework to automate the design process of detached residences while optimizing their energy performance. The ANN model was developed using the machine learning platform TensorFlow and some Python-based Keras libraries based on a big data set of about 17,000 newly constructed detached residences in Florida between the years 2009 and 2021. The GD framework was established using Autodesk Dynamo and the Autodesk Revit GD add-on that uses the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II), in which multiple design parameters mainly relating to the house geometry and its energy performance were incorporated. Considering 10 independent variables, including the total wall area, roof area, floor area, and the windows' U-value, the ANN model predicted the required capacities of the cooling and heating systems in detached houses, with R2 values of 0.955 and 0.904, respectively. The ANN then was integrated within the GD framework for performance evaluation purposes. The findings of this study resulted in a fully automated 3-min design process of an energy-efficient detached house envelope, maximizing the productivity of designers and developers and greatly reducing the financial strain and time consumed using traditional techniques.

AB For a long time topological relationships between spatial objects have been a focus of research in a number of disciplines like artificial intelligence, cognitive science, linguistics, robotics, and spatial reasoning. Especially as predicates they support the design of suitable query languages for spatial data retrieval and analysis in spatial databases and geographical information systems (GIS). Unfortunately, they have so far only been defined for and applicable to simplified abstractions of spatial objects like single points, continuous lines, and simple regions. With the introduction of complex spatial data types an issue arises regarding the design, definition, and number of topological relationships operating on these complex types. This article closes this gap and first introduces definitions of general and versatile spatial data types for complex points, complex lines, and complex regions. Based on the well known 9-intersection model, it then determines the complete sets of mutually exclusive topological relationships for all type combinations. Completeness and mutual exclusion are shown by a proof technique called proof-by-constraint-and-drawing. Due to the resulting large numbers of predicates and the difficulty of handling them, the user is provided with the concepts of topological cluster predicates and topological predicate groups, which permit one to reduce the number of predicates to be dealt with in a user-defined and/or application-specific manner.

AB Currently, many critical care indices are not captured automatically at a granular level, rather are repetitively assessed by overburdened nurses. In this pilot study, we examined the feasibility of using pervasive sensing technology and artificial intelligence for autonomous and granular monitoring in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). As an exemplary prevalent condition, we characterized delirious patients and their environment. We used wearable sensors, light and sound sensors, and a camera to collect data on patients and their environment. We analyzed collected data to detect and recognize patient's face, their postures, facial action units and expressions, head pose variation, extremity movements, sound pressure levels, light intensity level, and visitation frequency. We found that facial expressions, functional status entailing extremity movement and postures, and environmental factors including the visitation frequency, light and sound pressure levels at night were significantly different between the delirious and non-delirious patients. Our results showed that granular and autonomous monitoring of critically ill patients and their environment is feasible using a noninvasive system, and we demonstrated its potential for characterizing critical care patients and environmental factors.

TI Traffic Flow Prediction Based on Spatiotemporal Potential Energy Fields

   potential energy fields; spatiotemporal data mining
ID NETWORKS; MODEL
AB Traffic flow prediction is a fundamental problem in spatiotemporal data mining. Most of the existing studies focuses on designing statistical models to fit historical traffic data, which are purely data-driven approaches and fail to reveal the underlying mechanisms of urban traffic. To address this issue, we propose the spatiotemporal potential energy field model (ST-PEF+), which applies the field theory for human mobility to interpret the underlying mechanisms of urban traffic, and introduces the theory into data-driven deep learning models. ST-PEF+ consists of a PEF extraction module and a data-driven module. Inspired by the field theory for human mobility, the PEF extraction module adopts an algorithm to decompose the grid-based traffic flow graph into several polytree-based potential energy fields (PEFs), where traffic flows from high potential locations to low potential locations, just as water is driven by the gravity field. We also provide a theoretical analysis to ensure that the polytree decomposition algorithm can decompose any traffic flow graph. In the data-driven module, ST-PEF+ learns a spatiotemporal deep learning model to predict the dynamics of PEFs. The model adopts correlation-adaptive neural network structures, which consists of a temporal component for temporal correlations and a spatial component for spatial correlations. The temporal component employs a GRU and DCN combined structure to capture both short-term autocorrelation and long-term repeating patterns of PEFs. The spatial component extends the GAT using weighted directed attention to model the asymmetric spatial structure in PEFs. The prediction results of traffic flow are finally derived from PEFs that are predicted by the spatiotemporal deep learning model. We conduct extensive evaluations on three real-world traffic datasets. The results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines. In addition, case studies confirm that the PEFs learned in our framework can reveal the underlying mechanisms of urban traffic, thus improving the model interpretability.

AB Accurate prediction of product failures and the need for repair services become critical for various reasons, including understanding the warranty performance of manufacturers, defining cost-efficient repair strategies, and compliance with safety standards. The purpose of this study is to use machine learning tools to analyze several parameters crucial for achieving a robust repair service system, including the number of repairs, the time of the next repair ticket or product failure, and the time to repair. A large data set of over 530,000 repairs and maintenance of medical devices has been investigated by employing the Support Vector Machine (SVM) tool. SVM with four kernel functions is used to forecast the timing of the next failure or repair request in the system for two different products and two different failure types, namely, random failure and physical damage. Frequency analysis is also conducted to explore the product quality level based on product failure and the time to repair it. Besides, the best probability distributions are fitted for the failure count, the time between failures, and the time to repair. The results reveal the value of data analytics and machine learning tools in analyzing post-market product performance and the cost of repair and maintenance operations.

AB Biomass is a key biophysical parameter for precision agriculture and plant breeding. Fast, accurate and non-destructive monitoring of biomass enables various applications related to crop growth. In this paper, strawberry dry biomass weight was modeled using 4 canopy geometric parameters (area, average height, volume, standard deviation of height) and 25 spectral variables (5 band original reflectance values and 20 vegetation indices (VIs)) extracted from the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) multispectral imagery. Six regression techniques-multiple linear regression (MLR), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and artificial neural network (ANN)-were employed and evaluated for biomass prediction. The ANN had the highest accuracy in a five-fold cross-validation, with R-2 of 0.89-0.93, RMSE of 7.16-8.98 g and MAE of 5.06-6.29 g. As for the other five models, the addition of VIs increased the R-2 from 0.77-0.80 to 0.83-0.86, and reduced the RMSE from 8.89-9.58 to 7.35-8.09 g and the MAE from 6.30-6.70 to 5.25-5.47 g, respectively. Red-edge-related VIs, including the normalized difference red-edge index (NDRE), simple ratio vegetation index red-edge (SRRedEdge), modified simple ratio red-edge (MSRRedEdge) and chlorophyll index red and red-edge (CIred&RE), were the most influential VIs for biomass modeling. In conclusion, the combination of canopy geometric parameters and VIs obtained from the UAV imagery was effective for strawberry dry biomass estimation using machine learning models.

ID QUERY
AB Topological relationships like overlap, inside, meet, and disjoint uniquely characterize the relative position between objects in space. For a long time, they have been a focus of interdisciplinary research as in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, linguistics, robotics, and spatial reasoning. Especially as predicates, they support the design of suitable query languages for spatial data retrieval and analysis in spatial database systems and geographical information systems. While, to a large extent, conceptual aspects of topological predicates (like their definition and reasoning with them) as well as strategies for avoiding unnecessary or repetitive predicate executions (like predicate migration and spatial index structures) have been emphasized, the development of robust and efficient implementation techniques for them has been largely neglected. Especially the recent design of topological predicates for all combinations of complex spatial data types has resulted in a large increase of their numbers and stressed the importance of their efficient implementation. The goal of this article is to develop correct and efficient implementation techniques of topological predicates for all combinations of complex spatial data types including two-dimensional point, line, and region objects, as they have been specified by different authors and in different commercial and public domain software packages. Our solution consists of two phases. In the exploration phase, for a given scene of two spatial objects, all topological events like intersection and meeting situations are summarized in two precisely defined topological feature vectors (one for each argument object of a topological predicate) whose specifications are characteristic and unique for each combination of spatial data types. These vectors serve as input for the evaluation phase which analyzes the topological events and determines the Boolean result of a topological predicate (predicate verification) or the kind of topological predicate (predicate determination) by a formally defined method called nine-intersection matrix characterization. Besides this general evaluation method, the article presents an optimized method for predicate verification, called matrix thinning, and an optimized method for predicate determination, called minimum cost decision tree. The methods presented in this article are applicable to all known complete collections of mutually exclusive topological predicates that are formally based on the well known nine-intersection model.

AB Farmers and stakeholders who use groundwater for irrigation need efficient and cost-effective tools to support sustainable crop production. The variation of groundwater levels at local scale and its continuous use for agriculture intensifies the demand for reliable groundwater information. However, groundwater levels are very dynamic and difficult to predict under traditional modeling approaches, and manual monitoring of wells is costly and time-consuming. Simplified but powerful machine learning models represent a practical alternative to support groundwater management decisions at the farm scale. The predictive capacity of a nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous inputs (NARX) artificial neural network (ANN) and a support vector regression (SVR) trained with a radial basis function (RBF) algorithm were evaluated for an irrigation well located in a highly productive agricultural region in the southeastern USA. We used separately multiple years of daily historical time series classified by summer (withdrawal) and winter (recharge) seasons and evaluated the impacts of this division in the models' predictive capability. Results showed that SVR had a better modeling performance based on the mean squared error (MSE) and prediction trend for both seasons. In addition, our study suggests that the prediction of daily levels with input time series classified by seasons provides higher accuracy than using the entire withdrawal and recharge periods as a whole. Results also indicate that the recharge season becomes a linear problem, which substantially reduces the SVR modeling computational requirements. The application of our proposed modeling approach in the management of groundwater sources for irrigation provides important information, at short time scale, for the estimation of groundwater variability at local scale.

ID DESIGN
AB Recent trend in eCommerce applications toward effectively reducing supply chain costs-including spatial, temporal, and monetary resources-has spurred interest among researchers as well as practitioners to efficiently utilize supply chains. One of the least studied of these views is adaptive or dynamic configuration of supply chains. This problem is relatively new since faster communications over the Internet or by any other means and the willingness to utilize it for effective management of supply chains did not exist a few decades ago. The proposed framework addresses the problem of supply chain configuration. We incorporate machine-learning techniques to develop a dynamically configurable supply chain framework, and evaluate its effectiveness with respect to comparable static supply chains. Specifically, we consider the case where several parts go into the production of a product. A single supplier or a combination of suppliers could supply these parts. The proposed framework automatically forms the supply chain dynamically as per the dictates of incoming orders and the constraints from suppliers upstream. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose Little is known about the characteristics and impact of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) during episodes of asthma exacerbation. We aimed to characterize patients diagnosed with acute PE in the setting of asthma exacerbation, develop a prediction model to help identify future patients and assess the impact of acute PE on hospital outcomes. Methods We included 758 patients who were treated for asthma exacerbation and underwent a computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTA) during the same encounter at a university-based hospital between June 2011 and October 2018. We compared clinical characteristics of patients with and without acute PE and developed a machine learning prediction model to classify the PE status based on the clinical variables. We used multivariable regression analysis to evaluate the impact of acute PE on hospital outcomes. Results Twenty percent of the asthma exacerbation patients who underwent CTA had an acute PE. Factors associated with acute PE included previous history of PE, high CHA(2)DS(2)-VASc score, hyperlipidemia, history of deep vein thrombosis, malignancy, chronic systemic corticosteroids use, high body mass index and atrial fibrillation. Using these factors, we developed a random forest machine learning prediction model which had an 88% accuracy in classifying the acute PE status of the patients (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.899; 95% confidence interval: 0.885-0.913). Acute PE in asthma exacerbation was associated with longer hospital stay and intensive care unit stay. Conclusion It is important to consider acute PE, a potentially life-threatening event, in the setting of asthma exacerbation especially when other risk factors are present.

DE Inverse reinforcement learning; Inverse optimal control; Optimal

AB A key challenge in solving the deterministic inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) problem online and in real-time is the existence of multiple solutions. Nonuniqueness necessitates the study of the notion of equivalent solutions, i.e., solutions that result in a different cost functional but same feedback matrix. While offline algorithms that result in convergence to equivalent solutions have been developed in the literature, online, real-time techniques that address nonuniqueness are not available. In this paper, a regularized history stack observer that converges to approximately equivalent solutions of the IRL problem is developed. Novel data-richness conditions are developed to facilitate the analysis and simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed technique. (c) 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, a novel framework is presented for designing lifetime-reliable SoCs with self-adaptation capability against aging-induced degradation. The proposed flow utilizes the existing logic built-in-self-test (LBIST) hardware, and software implemented machine learning predictor to activate appropriate countermeasures to remedy the wear out in the field. Using an innovative method, we convert ATPG-generated transition delay test patterns into LBIST patterns to activate highusage critical/ near-critical paths in-field, and the corresponding responses are utilized in developing the predictor. A gate-overlap and path-delay-aware algorithm selects the optimum set of patterns. The area and test time overhead for the framework are very low. We implemented our proposed flow on SoC benchmark designs, and the results demonstrated its efficacy.

AB The advancement of vital sign radar technology has proven to be a useful tool in assessing various physiological dynamics, including heartbeat and respiration. There remains several signal processing challenges in this field, which include overcoming the nonlinearities and harmonics that populate the power spectrum. Respiration harmonics distort and overwhelm the measurement of heartbeat due to the large signal amplitude. A supervised machine learning algorithm, the gamma filter, offers an efficient, calibration-free solution to model the time series heartbeat signal given respiration and respiration artifacts. The measured signal is provided by a 5.8-GHz quadrature Doppler radar and a modified electrocardiogram signal is used as the ground truth for training the filter. Experimental results show that the heartbeat is independent and separable from respiration and the algorithm can be implemented in real time.

AB Purpose: Recent developments in the field of artificial intelligence and acoustics have made it possible to objectively monitor cough in clinical and ambulatory settings. We hypothesized that time patterns of objectively measured cough in COVID-19 patients could predict clinical prognosis and help rapidly identify patients at high risk of intubation or death.Methods: One hundred and twenty-three patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were enrolled at University of Florida Health Shands and the Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite acute accent de Montre acute accent al. Patients' cough was continuously monitored digitally along with clinical severity of disease until hospital discharge, intubation, or death. The natural history of cough in hospitalized COVID-19 disease was described and logistic models fitted on cough time patterns were used to predict clinical outcomes.Results: In both cohorts, higher early coughing rates were associated with more favorable clinical outcomes. The transitional cough rate, or maximum cough per hour rate predicting unfavorable outcomes, was 3.40 and the AUC for cough frequency as a predictor of unfavorable outcomes was 0.761. The initial 6 h (0.792) and 24 h (0.719) post-enrolment observation periods confirmed this association and showed similar predictive value.Interpretation: Digital cough monitoring could be used as a prognosis biomarker to predict unfavorable clinical outcomes in COVID-19 disease. With early sampling periods showing good predictive value, this digital biomarker could be combined with clinical and paraclinical evaluation and is well adapted for triaging patients in overwhelmed or resources-limited health programs.

AB This paper presents a practical deep-learning-based crack detection model for inspecting concrete pavement, asphalt pavement, and bridge deck cracks. Crack detection is a typical semantic segmentation task; thus, we propose an encoder-decoder structural model with a fully convolutional neural network, namely, PCSN, by referring to SegNet. This model accepts images of arbitrary size as input data and can be trained pixel by pixel. Moreover, VGG16 net is adopted without the top layer as the encoder, and it is initialized with open-source pretrained weights. "Adadelta" is employed as the optimizer and the cross-entropy is used as the loss function. a crack dataset of images containing complex crack textures is constructed by manual pixelwise annotation. Finally, the dataset is fed into PCSN to train and test the network. FCN-8s and MRCNN are also trained with the same dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate that the PCSN outperforms other algorithm on crack detection, additionally, the basic principle of methodological integration is also briefly introduced.

AB Excessive use of herbicides for weed control increases the cost of crop production and can lead to environmental degradation. An intelligent spraying system can apply agrochemicals on an as-needed basis by detecting and selectively targeting the weeds. The objective of this research was to investigate the feasibility of using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) for detecting lamb's quarters (Chenopodium album) in potato fields. Five potato fields were selected in Prince Edward Island (PEI) and New Brunswick (NB), Canada to collect images of spatially and temporally varied potato plants and lamb's quarters. The image database included pictures, taken under varying growth stages of potato, outdoor light (clear, cloudy, and partly cloudy), and shadowy conditions. The images were trained for DCNN models, namely GoogLe Net, VGG-16, and Efficient Net to classify lamb's quarters and potato plants. Performance of two frameworks, namely Tensor Flow and PyTorch, were compared in training, testing, and during inferring the DCNNs. Results showed excellent performance of DCNNs in lamb's quarters and potato plant classification (accuracy > 90%). However, the Efficient Net with PyTorch framework showed a maximum accuracy of (0.92-0.97) for every growth stage of the plants. Inference times of DCNNs were recorded using three graphics processing units (GPUs), namely Nvidia GeForce 930MX, Nvidia GeForce GTX1080 Ti, and Nvidia GeForce GTX1050. All the DCNNs performed better with PyTorch than Tensor Flow frameworks. It was concluded that the trained models can be used in automation of the spraying systems for the site-specific application of agrochemicals for weed control in potato fields. Such precision agriculture technologies will ensure economically viable and environmentally safe potato cultivation.

AB This paper presents the results of a simulation model regarding the productivity and safety working space for construction workers through the floors of a building using swarm intelligence (SI), a field of artificial intelligence (AI), and specifically using artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization. After designing the algorithm used to build the simulation model, the simulation was used in an actual building project by comparing the travel times of workers conventionally transporting material with another group working on routes optimized by the algorithm. Thus, the proposed algorithm provides routes combining shorter travel times and correct distances between workers when transporting materials in a construction site, handling the interference between crews. After validating the algorithm on-site, no statistically significant differences were found between the travel times of workers and the times delivered by the algorithm. Additionally, the travel times using the routes obtained through the algorithm were significantly lower than those made by workers who moved freely without a predefined route. In summary, the algorithm proposed may help construction practitioners maintain safe movements that respond to hazard contexts imposed by any restriction that demands a safety distance.

ID FINANCIAL NEWS; PREDICTION
AB In recent years, there has been an increased interest from both academics and practitioners in automatically analyzing the textual part of companies' financial reports to extract meaning rich in information for future outcomes. In particular, tracking textual changes among companies' reports can have a large and significant impact on stock prices. This impact happens with a lag implying that investors only gradually realize the implications of the news hinted by document changes. However, the length of these documents as well as their complexity in terms of structure and language have been increasing dramatically making this process more and more difficult to perform. In this paper, we analyzed how to face this complexity by learning arbitrary dimensional vector representations for US corporate filings (10-Ks) from 1998 to 2018, exploiting and comparing different neural network embedding techniques which take into account words' semantics through vectors proximity. We also compared their ability to capture changes associated with future risk-adjusted abnormal returns with other more commonly used approaches in literature. Finally, we propose a novel investment strategy named Semantic Similarity Portfolio (SSP) that exploits these neural network embeddings. We show that firms that do not change their 10-Ks in a semantically important way from the previous year tend to have large and statistically significant future risk-adjusted abnormal returns. We, also document an amplifying effect when we incorporate a momentum-related criterion, where the companies selected must also have had positive previous year returns. Specifically, a portfolio that buys "non-changers" based on this strategy earns up to 10% in yearly risk-adjusted abnormal returns (alpha).

AB We present new constraints on the masses of the halos hosting the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies derived using graph neural networks. Our models, trained on 2,000 state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations of the CAMELS project, only make use of the positions, velocities and stellar masses of the galaxies belonging to the halos, and are able to perform likelihood-free inference on halo masses while accounting for both cosmological and astrophysical uncertainties. Our constraints are in agreement with estimates from other traditional methods, within our derived posterior standard deviation.

TI Cosmic Ray Background Removal With Deep Neural Networks in SBND
SO FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
LA English
DT Article

   detectors
AB In liquid argon time projection chambers exposed to neutrino beams and running on or near surface levels, cosmic muons, and other cosmic particles are incident on the detectors while a single neutrino-induced event is being recorded. In practice, this means that data fromsurface liquid argon time projection chambers will be dominated by cosmic particles, both as a source of event triggers and as the majority of the particle count in true neutrino-triggered events. In this work, we demonstrate a novel application of deep learning techniques to remove these background particles by applying deep learning on full detector images from the SBND detector, the near detector in the Fermilab Short-Baseline Neutrino Program. We use this technique to identify, on a pixel-by-pixel level, whether recorded activity originated from cosmic particles or neutrino interactions.

ID FUTURE
AB Applications of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) combined with Machine Learning (ML) techniques enhance real-time performance tracking and increase structural integrity awareness of civil, aerospace and automotive infrastructures. This SHM-ML synergy has gained popularity in the last years thanks to the anticipation of maintenance provided by arising ML algorithms and their ability of handling large quantities of data and considering their influence in the problem.In this paper we develop a novel ML nearest-neighbors-alike algorithm based on the principle of maximum entropy to predict fatigue damage (Palmgren-Miner index) in composite materials by processing the signals of Lamb Waves - a non-destructive SHM technique - with other meaningful features such as layup parameters and stiffness matrices calculated from the Classical Laminate Theory (CLT). The full data analysis cycle is applied to a dataset of delamination experiments in composites. The predictions achieve a good level of accuracy, similar to other ML algorithms, e.g. Neural Networks or Gradient-Boosted Trees, and computation times are of the same order of magnitude.The key advantages of our proposal are: (1) The automatic determination of all the parameters involved in the prediction, so no hyperparameters have to be set beforehand, which saves time devoted to hypertuning the model and also represents an advantage for autonomous, self-supervised SHM. (2) No training is required, which, in an online learning context where streams of data are fed continuously to the model, avoids repeated training-essential for reliable real-time, continuous monitoring.

AB The plight of navigating high-dimensional transcription datasets remains a persistent problem. This problem is further amplified for complex disorders, such as cancer as these disorders are often multigenic traits with multiple subsets of genes collectively affecting the type, stage, and severity of the trait. We are often faced with a trade off between reducing the dimensionality of our datasets and maintaining the integrity of our data. To accomplish both tasks simultaneously for very high dimensional transcriptome for complex multigenic traits, we propose a new supervised technique, Class Separation Transformation (CST). CST accomplishes both tasks simultaneously by significantly reducing the dimensionality of the input space into a one-dimensional transformed space that provides optimal separation between the differing classes. Furthermore, CST offers an means of explainable ML, as it computes the relative importance of each feature for its contribution to class distinction, which can thus lead to deeper insights and discovery. We compare our method with existing state-of-the-art methods using both real and synthetic datasets, demonstrating that CST is the more accurate, robust, scalable, and computationally advantageous technique relative to existing methods.

AB Reinforcers frequently chosen may not offer the same nutritional value as fruits and vegetables. Prior researchers have explored preferences and the effectiveness of salty and sweet foods compared to fruits and vegetables, but the criteria for demonstrating effectiveness have often been arbitrary rather than academic. In addition, it remains unclear how the integration of these potentially nutritious reinforcers might affect learning or hinder learning efficiency. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate whether introducing fruits or vegetables as potential reinforcers could sustain responding achieved with salty or sweet reinforcers. The implications of this model for incorporating a variety of reinforcers while maintaining responding are also discussed.

AB This paper seeks to combine differential game theory with the actor-critic-identifier architecture to determine forward-in-time, approximate optimal controllers for formation tracking in multiagent systems, where the agents have uncertain heterogeneous nonlinear dynamics. A continuous control strategy is proposed, using communication feedback from extended neighbors on a communication topology that has a spanning tree. A model-based reinforcement learning technique is developed to cooperatively control a group of agents to track a trajectory in a desired formation. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the developed technique.

AB The Entomological Society of America (ESA) Student Debates is an annual student competition at the ESA Annual Meeting organized by Student Debates Subcommittee (SDS) members of the ESA Student Affairs Committee. In conjunction with the 2023 ESA Annual Meeting theme, 'Insects and influence: Advancing entomology's impact on people and policy', the theme of this year's student debate was 'Addressing emerging issues in entomology'. With the aid of ESA membership, the SDS selected the following debate topics: (1) Should disclosure of artificial intelligence large language models in scientific writing always be required? and (2) Is it more important to prioritize honey bee or native pollinator health for long-term food security within North America? Four student teams from across the nation, composed of 3-5 student members and a professional advisor, were assigned a topic and stance. Over the course of 5 months, all team members researched and prepared for their assigned topic before debating live with an opposing team at the 2023 ESA Annual Meeting in National Harbor, Maryland. SDS members additionally prepared and presented introductions for each debate topic to provide unbiased backgrounds to the judges and audience for context in assessing teams' arguments. The result was an engaging discussion between our teams, judges, and audience members on emerging issues facing entomology and its impact on people and policy, such as scientific communication and food security, that brought attention to the complexities involved when debating topics concerning insects and influence.

   outcomes framework; quasi-experimental designs; inverse probability of
   treatment weighting
AB Artificial neural networks (NN) can help researchers estimate propensity scores for quasi-experimental estimation of treatment effects because they can automatically detect complex interactions involving many covariates. However, NN is difficult to implement due to the complexity of choosing an algorithm for various treatment levels and monitoring model performance. This research aims to develop a tutorial to facilitate the use of NN to derive causal inferences. The tutorial provides social scientists with a gentle overview of machine learning terminology and best practices for training, validating, and testing NN to estimate propensity scores. The veracity of NN is demonstrated in this study using data on 5,770 teachers from the Beginner Teacher Longitudinal Study. Propensity score analysis was used to estimate the effects of assigning mentors to new teachers on the probability of continuing in the teaching profession. The results show that NN provided a better covariate balance between treatment versions than multinomial logistic regression and generalized boosted modeling. The study's findings align with previous research showing NN's advantages over conventional propensity score estimation methods.

AB Businesses across Latin America are working towards economic recovery. This case study of the Consumer-Packaged Goods (CPG) industry shows how business intelligence can help organizations more accurately forecast demand by applying business analytics and machine learning. The study case discusses how traditional forecasting methods are being utilized today and what limitations and challenges they are facing, and what machine learning alternatives exist. Also, it is discussed why data granularity was a key factor in creating the proposed forecasting models and how machine learning capabilities provide better insights and more accurate results. Lastly, the implementation of data-driven philosophy is discussed, explaining components, interaction, data gathering, transformation, and what technologies were used. This comprehensive study case can help other enterprises looking to start their journey to become data-driven organizations relying on business analytics to make better decisions during their efforts for economic recovery.

ID IMPACTS
AB The aim of this article was to describe a novel methodology for transforming complex nursing care plan data into meaningful variables to assess the impact of nursing care. We extracted standardized care plan data for older adults from the electronic health records of 4 hospitals. We created a palliative care framework with 8 categories. A subset of the data was manually classified under the framework, which was then used to train random forest machine learning algorithms that performed automated classification. Two expert raters achieved a 78% agreement rate. Random forest classifiers trained using the expert consensus achieved accuracy (agreement with consensus) between 77% and 89%. The best classifier was utilized for the automated classification of the remaining data. Utilizing machine learning reduces the cost of transforming raw data into representative constructs that can be used in research and practice to understand the essence of nursing specialty care, such as palliative care.

AB Urban systems involve a multitude of closely intertwined components, which are more measurable than before due to new sensors, data collection, and spatio-temporal analysis methods. Turning these data into knowledge to facilitate planning efforts in addressing current challenges of urban complex systems requires advanced interdisciplinary analysis methods, such as urban informatics or urban data science. Yet, by applying a purely data-driven approach, it is too easy to get lost in the 'forest' of data, and to miss the 'trees' of successful, livable cities that are the ultimate aim of urban planning. This paper assesses how geospatial data, and urban analysis, using a mixed methods approach, can help to better understand urban dynamics and human behavior, and how it can assist planning efforts to improve livability. Based on reviewing state-of-the-art research the paper goes one step further and also addresses the potential as well as limitations of new data sources in urban analytics to get a better overview of the whole 'forest' of these new data sources and analysis methods. The main discussion revolves around the reliability of using big data from social media platforms or sensors, and how information can be extracted from massive amounts of data through novel analysis methods, such as machine learning, for better-informed decision making aiming at urban livability improvement.

AB We present a machine learning approach to calculate unrelaxed and relaxed formation energies of compounds relative to the ground state crystal structure of the pure components in the context of structure predictions in binary systems. Typical methods for structure predictions such as genetic algorithms often rely on density-functional theory codes to perform such calculations at a relatively high computational cost. In this work, we explore two commonly used kernel-based learning algorithms, kernel ridge regression and support vector regression. The efficiency of machine learning approaches relies on suitable data representations that encode the relevant physical information about the crystal structures. We select partial radial distribution functions to represent this structural information. We apply the machine learning approaches to the binary Li-Ge system and show that these methods provide small root-mean square prediction errors of about 20 meV/atom across the composition and structure space. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the model can be trained to predict the formation energies of the relaxed structures with the same accuracy when given unrelaxed structures as input. The high accuracy for the prediction of the relaxed energies of unrelaxed structures suggests that the machine-learning method can eliminate unlikely candidate structures from a genetic algorithm search, thus reducing the computational cost required for the explorations of energy landscapes and improving the performance of genetic algorithms for structure predictions.

AB Introduction Historically, therapeutic treatment of disease has been restricted to targeting proteins. Of the approximately 20,000 translated human proteins, approximately 1600 are associated with diseases. Strikingly, less than 15% of disease-associated proteins are predicted or known to be 'druggable.' While the concept and narrative of protein druggability continue to evolve with the development of novel technological and pharmacological advances, most of the human proteome remains undrugged. Recent genomic studies indicate that less than 2% of the human genome encodes for proteins, and while as much as 75% of the genome is transcribed, RNA has largely been ignored as a druggable target for therapeutic interventions. Areas covered This review delineates the theory and techniques involved in the development of small molecule inhibitors of RNAs from brute force, high-throughput screening technologies to de novo molecular design using computational machine and deep learning. We will also highlight the potential pitfalls and limitations of targeting RNA with small molecules. Expert opinion Although significant advances have recently been made in developing systems to identify small molecule inhibitors of RNAs, many challenges remain. Focusing on RNA structure and ligand binding sites may help bring drugging RNA in line with traditional protein drug targeting.

AB Landslide is a severe geohazard in many mountainous areas of Vietnam during the rainy season. They directly threaten human lives and properties every year. Landslide susceptibility maps are useful tools for risk mitigation, land-use planning, and early warning systems for local areas. It is necessary to update these maps continuously because of the complexity of landslide events. This fact requires further extending the approach techniques with practical implications. Therefore, this study aimed to develop landslide susceptibility prediction maps based on advanced machine learning (ML) techniques. Five state-of-the-art hybrid ML models were developed: bagging MLP, dagging MLP, decorate MLP, rotation forest MLP, and random subspace MLP with multilayer perceptron (MLP) as a base classifier. Sixteen causative factors were collected to build landslide susceptibility maps based on the relationship between historical landslide locations and specific local geo-environmental conditions. The model performance was verified using various statistical indexes. Based on the area under ROC curve (AUC) analysis results of the testing dataset, the rotation forest MLP model has the greatest predictive accuracy of AUC = 0.818. It is followed by the decorate MLP and bagging MLP (AUC = 0.804), the random subspace MLP model (AUC = 0.796), the dagging MLP (AUC = 0.789), and the single MLP (AUC = 0.698). The results of this study can be applied effectively to other mountainous regions to mitigate the risk of landslides.

AB Diabetic retinopathy is a severe ocular condition that can result in vision loss due to damage to the retinal vessels. Early detection is of paramount importance in reducing the risk of further vision impairment and guiding appropriate treatment strategies. This study presents an innovative approach to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of diabetic retinopathy detection by integrating the Inception-V4 deep learning-based neural network with a modified dynamic Snow Leopard Optimization (DSLO) algorithm. The DSLO algorithm optimizes feature selection, thereby contributing to improved diagnostic performance. By analyzing digital images obtained during routine eye exams, automated image processing algorithms can identify early signs of diabetic retinopathy, such as leaking vessels or optic nerve edema. The proposed Inception-V4/DSLO model is evaluated using a practical dataset, Diabetic Retinopathy 2015, and compared to other state-of-the-art models, including mining local and long-range dependence (MLLD), parallel convolutional neural network (PCNN) and ELM classifier (PCNN/ELM), diabetic retinopathy using convolutional neural networks for feature extraction and classification (DRFEC), Retrained AlexNet convolutional neural network (R-AlexNet), and Deep-DR demonstrating superior performance and improved detection of early-stage diabetic retinopathy cases.

ID MACHINE; SIMULATION
AB Active machine learning is widely used in computational studies where repeated numerical simulations can be conducted on high performance computers without human intervention. But translation of these active learning methods to physical systems has proven more difficult and the accelerated pace of discoveries aided by these methods remains as yet unrealized. Through the presentation of a general active learning framework and its application to large-scale boundary layer wind tunnel experiments, we demonstrate that the active learning framework used so successfully in computational studies is directly applicable to the investigation of physical experimental systems and the corresponding improvements in the rate of discovery can be transformative. We specifically show that, for our wind tunnel experiments, we are able to achieve in approximately 300 experiments a learning objective that would be impossible using traditional methods.

AB Empirical studies have shown that pruning a decision tree can increase the accuracy of a learned concept. A recent result identified conditions under which pruning techniques increase prediction accuracy. However, this result is based on samples of size three. This paper provides a generalization of previous results and investigates conditions where pruning is beneficial for concept accuracy as well as concept simplification. We show that pruning is theoretically useful in many situations.

AB This article addresses the problem of learning the objective function of linear discrete-time systems that use static output-feedback (OPFB) control by designing inverse reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Most of the existing inverse RL methods require the availability of states and state-feedback control from the expert or demonstrated system. In contrast, this article considers inverse RL in a more general case where the demonstrated system uses static OPFB control with only input-output measurements available. We first develop a model-based inverse RL algorithm to reconstruct an input-output objective function of a demonstrated discrete-time system using its system dynamics and the OPFB gain. This objective function infers the demonstrations and OPFB gain of the demonstrated system. Then, an input-output Q -function is built for the inverse RL problem upon the state reconstruction technique. Given demonstrated inputs and outputs, a data-driven inverse Q -learning algorithm reconstructs the objective function without the knowledge of the demonstrated system dynamics or the OPFB gain. This algorithm yields unbiased solutions even though exploration noises exist. Convergence properties and the nonunique solution nature of the proposed algorithms are studied. Numerical simulation examples verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

AB Multiple-instance learning (MIL) is a learning paradigm used for learning a target concept in the presence of noise or with an uncertainty in target information including class labels. Due to the difficult situations in which hyperspectral images (HSIs) are collected, research in this area is extremely relevant and directly applicable. In the following, an MIL framework is proposed for target spectra learning for HSI analysis. MIL techniques are compared to their non-MIL counterparts (standard machine learning techniques). Experimental results indicate that MIL can learn target spectra with a lack of target information and, furthermore, result in improved classifiers.

DE Analysis and statistical methods; Pattern recognition; cluster finding;
   calibration and fitting methods; Neutrino detectors
AB We present a simulation-based study using deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) to identify neutrino interaction vertices in the MINERvA passive targets region, and illustrate the application of domain adversarial neural networks (DANNs) in this context. DANNs are designed to be trained in one domain (simulated data) but tested in a second domain (physics data) and utilize unlabeled data from the second domain so that during training only features which are unable to discriminate between the domains are promoted. MINERvA is a neutrino-nucleus scattering experiment using the NuMI beamline at Fermilab. A-dependent cross sections are an important part of the physics program, and these measurements require vertex finding in complicated events. To illustrate the impact of the DANN we used a modified set of simulation in place of physics data during the training of the DANN and then used the label of the modified simulation during the evaluation of the DANN. We find that deep learning based methods offer significant advantages over our prior track-based reconstruction for the task of vertex finding, and that DANNs are able to improve the performance of deep networks by leveraging available unlabeled data and by mitigating network performance degradation rooted in biases in the physics models used for training.

AB This paper is concerned with optimal control problems for control systems in continuous time, and interacting particle system methods designed to construct approximate control solutions. Particular attention is given to the linear quadratic (LQ) control problem. There is a growing interest in re-visiting this classical problem, in part due to the successes of reinforcement learning (RL). The main question of this body of research (and also of our paper) is to approximate the optimal control law without explicitly solving the Riccati equation. A novel simulation-based algorithm, namely a dual ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), is introduced. The algorithm is used to obtain formulae for optimal control, expressed entirely in terms of the EnKF particles. An extension to the nonlinear case is also presented. The theoretical results and algorithms are illustrated with numerical experiments. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SO PLOS ONE

DT Article
ID RISK
AB Preterm birth (PTB) presents a complex challenge in pregnancy, often leading to significant perinatal and long-term morbidities. "While machine learning (ML) algorithms have shown promise in PTB prediction, the lack of interpretability in existing models hinders their clinical utility. This study aimed to predict PTB in a pregnant population using ML models, identify the key risk factors associated with PTB through the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm, and provide comprehensive explanations for these predictions to assist clinicians in providing appropriate care. This study analyzed a dataset of 3509 pregnant women in the United Arab Emirates and selected 35 risk factors associated with PTB based on the existing medical and artificial intelligence literature. Six ML algorithms were tested, wherein the XGBoost model exhibited the best performance, with an area under the operator receiving curves of 0.735 and 0.723 for parous and nulliparous women, respectively. The SHAP feature attribution framework was employed to identify the most significant risk factors linked to PTB. Additionally, individual patient analysis was performed using the SHAP and the local interpretable model-agnostic explanation algorithms (LIME). The overall incidence of PTB was 11.23% (11 and 12.1% in parous and nulliparous women, respectively). The main risk factors associated with PTB in parous women are previous PTB, previous cesarean section, preeclampsia during pregnancy, and maternal age. In nulliparous women, body mass index at delivery, maternal age, and the presence of amniotic infection were the most relevant risk factors. The trained ML prediction model developed in this study holds promise as a valuable screening tool for predicting PTB within this specific population. Furthermore, SHAP and LIME analyses can assist clinicians in understanding the individualized impact of each risk factor on their patients and provide appropriate care to reduce morbidity and mortality related to PTB.

AB Catastrophe insurance is an important element of disaster management. Yet the historical presence of inequalities in insurance, from redlining to pricing disparity, has had a devastating impact on minority communities. Whereas the fairness of insurance ratemaking is studied in general, we identify a unique challenge for catastrophe insurance that sets it apart from other lines of insurance. Drawing upon the recent advances in machine learning for fair data valuation, we reveal striking connections between the two seemingly unrelated problems and lean on insights from machine learning to mathematically and empirically study the fairness of ratemaking methods for catastrophe insurance. Our results indicate the potential existence of disparate impact against minorities across existing methods and point to a unique mathematical solution that can satisfy a few commonly assumed properties of fair ratemaking for catastrophe insurance.

AB This proposed novel method consists of three levels of analyses of diffusion tensor imaging data: 1) voxel level analysis of fractional anisotropy of white matter tracks, 2) connection level analysis, based on fiber tracks between specific brain regions, and 3) network level analysis, based connections among multiple brain regions. Machine-learning techniques of (Fisher score) feature selection, (Support Vector Machine) pattern classification, and (Leave-one-out) cross-validation are performed, for recognition of the neural connectivity patterns for diagnostic purposes. For validation proposes, this multilevel approach achieved an average classification accuracy of 90% between Alzheimer's disease and healthy controls, 83% between Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment, and 83% between mild cognitive impairment and healthy controls. The results indicate that the multilevel diffusion tensor imaging approach used in this analysis is a potential diagnostic tool for clinical evaluations of brain disorders. The presented pipeline is now available as a tool for scientifically applications in a broad range of studies from both clinical and behavioral spectrum, which includes studies about autism, dyslexia, schizophrenia, dementia, motor body performance, among others.

TI AdaLN: A Vision Transformer for Multidomain Learning and Predisaster
   Building Information Extraction from Images
SO JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING

DT Article
ID STREET VIEW; CLASSIFICATION
AB Satellite and street view images are widely used in various disciplines as a source of information for understanding the built environment. In natural hazard engineering, high-quality building inventory data sets are crucial for the simulation of hazard impacts and for supporting decision-making. Screening the building stocks to gather the information for simulation and to detect potential structural defects that are vulnerable to natural hazards is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. This paper presents an automated method for extracting building information through the use of satellite and street view images. The method is built upon a novel transformer-based deep neural network we developed. Specifically, a multidomain learning approach is employed to develop a single compact model for multiple image-based deep learning information extraction tasks using multiple data sources (e.g., satellite and street view images). Our multidomain Vision Transformer is designed as a unified architecture that can be effectively deployed for multiple classification tasks. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated in a case study in which we use pretrained models to collect regional-scale building information that is related to natural hazard risks.

AB Sea-level rise threatens to increase saltwater intrusion in low-lying coastal communities worldwide. In addition, changing patterns of evaporation and precipitation are expected to modify the lengths of saltwater intrusion in estuaries. This study aims to define the length of saltwater intrusion among distinct estuaries with contrasting responses to variations in river discharge and water level. A Markovchain Monte Carlo model was used as a supervised machine learning of the relationship among saltwater intrusion length, river discharge, water level, wind velocity and pluvial precipitation in three estuaries The supervised learning provided a relationship to project saltwater intrusion for different climatic conditions in the estuaries. The length of saltwater intrusion and river discharge were proportional for the dynamically deep Dee River estuary (UK) and Capibaribe River estuary (Brazil). Increased river discharge in those two estuaries was followed by increased limit of saltwater intrusion. For these two cases, however, it is hypothesized that beyond a threshold of river discharge, both estuaries will show a decreased saltwater intrusion with increased river discharge and transition to dynamically shallow estuaries. The dynamically shallow St. Johns River estuary (USA) had the typically expected response of decreased saltwater intrusion after increases in river discharge. (C) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB Electronics supply chain vulnerabilities have broadened in scope over the past two decades. With nearly all integrated circuit (IC) design companies relinquishing their fabrication, packaging, and test facilities, they are forced to rely upon companies from around the world to produce their ICs. This dependence leaves the electronics supply chain open to counterfeiting activities. In this article, we propose an electromagnetic (EM)-based fingerprinting framework, called EMFORCED, to detect remarked and cloned counterfeit ICs. Here, we demonstrate the benefits of using naturally occurring EM side channels to identify the IC design layout without decapsulating the chip under test. Enabling only the clock, Vdd , and ground pins allows us to generate a design-specific fingerprint that is dependent upon the physical parameters of the chip under test. EMFORCED leverages the EM emissions from the clock distribution network to create a holistic, design-level, fingerprint, including both temporal information and spatial information. We utilize the fingerprint information of functionally similar 8051-series microprocessors from three vendors and perform unsupervised (principal component analysis) and supervised (linear discriminant analysis) machine learning methods on all ICs to determine their intravendor and intervendor similarities. We acquired ICs from multiple dates and lot codes along with variants acquired from the gray market and analyzed them for authenticity using physical inspection and X-ray tomography. Statistical analysis and machine learning techniques are used to demonstrate the reference-free and reference-inclusive classification methods based on EMFORCED measurements. We demonstrate the classification accuracies of 99.46% and 100% for unsupervised and supervised approaches, respectively.

AB As coastal populations increase every year, greater numbers of people and buildings to support them are left vulnerable to severe hazards associated with hurricanes, which have shown signs of increasing strength and frequency related to climate change. Community-level decision making is essential to adequately prepare populations for the risks associated with imminent hurricanes and to adapt buildings to be more resilient. This creates a need for state-of-the-art methods such as data-driven machine learning to predict the damage that buildings will experience during hurricanes and support decisions for community stakeholders. Previous research has attempted to proactively forecast hurricane damage using numerical frameworks for individual building archetypes or by incorporating a narrow spectrum of input features. The focus of this study is a novel machine learning framework trained on building, hazard, and geospatial data to hindcast damage from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Michael, and Laura, with the objective of forecasting expected damage from future hurricanes. Performance of different algorithms were investigated including k-nearest neighbors, decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting trees algorithms. In predicting qualitative damage states, random forest outperforms other algorithms with 76% accuracy in the hindcast. Parametric studies identify which features contribute the most to accurate predictions and demonstrate that prediction accuracy increases linearly for this case study with additional reconnaissance data to train the model. Finally, a comparison is drawn between this model and the ability of Federal Emergency Management Agency's Hazus Multi-Hazard Hurricane Model to estimate building-specific damage on the same hindcast set of buildings.

AB In this paper, we proposed a novel approach for flood risk assessment, which is a combination of a deep learning algorithm and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). The framework of the flood risk assessment involves three main elements: hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. For this purpose, one of the flood-prone areas of Vietnam, namely Quang Nam province was selected as the study area. Data of 847 past flood locations of this area was analyzed to generate training and testing datasets for the models. In this study, we have used one of the popular Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) algorithm for generation of flood susceptibility map while Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), which is a popular MCDA approach, was used to generate the hazard, exposure, and vulnerability maps. We have also used hybrid models namely BFPA and DFPA which are the ensembles of Bagging and Decorate with Forest by Penalizing Attributes algorithm for the comparison of performance with DNNs method. Various standard statistical indices including Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were used for the performance evaluation and validation of the models. Results indicated that integration of DNNs and MCDA models is a promising approach for developing accurate flood risk assessment map of an area for the better flood hazard management.

AB When performing a demanding cognitive task, internal distraction in the form of task irrelevant thoughts and mind wandering can shift our attention away from the task, negatively affecting task performance. Behaviorally, individuals with higher executive function indexed by higher working memory capacity (WMC) exhibit less mind wandering during cognitive tasks, but the underlying neural mechanisms are unknown. To address this problem, we recorded functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from subjects performing a cued visual attention task, and assessed their WMC in a separate experiment. Applying machine learning and time-series analysis techniques, we showed that (1) higher WMC individuals experienced lower internal distraction through stronger suppression of posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) activity, (2) higher WMC individuals had better neural representations of attended information as evidenced by higher multivoxel decoding accuracy of cue-related activities in the dorsal attention network (DAN), (3) the positive relationship between WMC and DAN decoding accuracy was mediated by suppression of PCC activity, (4) the dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) was a source of top-down signals that regulate PCC activity as evidenced by the negative association between Granger-causal influence dACC -> PCC and PCC activity levels, and (5) higher WMC individuals exhibiting stronger dACC -> PCC Granger-causal influence. These results shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying the executive suppression of internal distraction in tasks requiring externally oriented attention and provide an explanation of the individual differences in such suppression.

AB Tumor subclass detection and diagnosis is inevitable requirement for personalized medical treatment and refinement of the effects that the somatic cells show towards other clinical conditions. The genome of these somatic cells exhibits mutations and genetic variations of the breast cancer cells and helps in understanding the characteristic behavior of the cancer cells. But their analysis is limited to clustering and there is requirement to analyze what else can be done with the data for identifying the tumor subcategory and the stages of subclasses. In this work, we have extended the work with similar data (consisting of 105 breast tumor cell lines) to solve other detection and characterization problems through computation and intelligent representation learning. Most of our work comprises of systematic data cleaning, analysis, and building prediction models with deep computational architectures and establish that the transformed data can help in better distinction of the respective categories. Our main contribution is the novel gene-subcategory interaction-based regularization (GSIAR) based data selection and analysis concept, alongside the prediction, proven to enhance the performance of the classification techniques.

AB Machine-learning algorithms are employed in a wide variety of applications to extract useful information from data sets, and many are known to suffer from super-linear increases in computational time with increasing data size and number of signals being processed (data dimension). Certain principal machine-learning algorithms are commonly found embedded in larger detection, estimation, or classification operations. Three such principal algorithms are the Parzen window-based, non-parametric estimation of Probability Density Functions (PDFs), K-means clustering and correlation. Because they form an integral part of numerous machine-learning applications, fast and efficient execution of these algorithms is extremely desirable. FPGA-based reconfigurable computing (RC) has been successfully used to accelerate computationally intensive problems in a wide variety of scientific domains to achieve speedup over traditional software implementations. However, this potential benefit is quite often not fully realized because creating efficient FPGA designs is generally carried out in a laborious, case-specific manner requiring a great amount of redundant time and effort. In this paper, an approach using pattern-based decomposition for algorithm acceleration on FPGAs is proposed that offers significant increases in productivity via design reusability. Using this approach, we design, analyze, and implement a multi-dimensional PDF estimation algorithm using Gaussian kernels on FPGAs. First, the algorithm's amenability to a hardware paradigm and expected speedups are predicted. After implementation, actual speedup and performance metrics are compared to the predictions, showing speedup on the order of 20x over a 3.2 GHz processor. Multi-core architectures are developed to further improve performance by scaling the design. Portability of the hardware design across multiple FPGA platforms is also analyzed. After implementing the PDF algorithm, the value of pattern-based decomposition to support reuse is demonstrated by rapid development of the K-means and correlation algorithms.

AB Continued urbanization, along with anthropogenic global warming, has and will increase land surface temperature and air temperature anomalies in urban areas when compared to their rural surroundings, leading to Urban Heat Islands (UHI). UHI poses environmental and health risks, affecting both psychological and physiological aspects of human health. Thus, using a deep learning approach that considers morphological variables, this study predicts UHI intensity in 69 European cities from 2007 to 2021 and projects UHI impacts for 2050 and 2080. The research employs Artificial Neural Networks, Deep Neural Networks, and Gated Recurrent Units, combining high-resolution 3D urban models with environmental data to analyze UHI trends. The results indicate strong associations between urban form, weather patterns, and UHI intensity, highlighting the need for customized urban planning and policy measures to reduce UHI impacts and foster sustainable urban settings. This research enhances understanding of UHI dynamics and serves as a valuable tool for urban planners and policymakers to address the challenges of climate change, urbanization, and air pollution, ultimately aiding in the improvement of health outcomes and building energy consumption. Moreover, the methodology effectively demonstrates the ability of the GRU to link its scores with UHI projections, offering crucial insights into potential health impacts.

AB This research investigates the parallel-batching scheduling problems with a time-dependent learning effect where the job processing time is a decreasing function of its starting time. Both the single-machine and parallel-machine circumstances are considered, and the objective is to minimize the makespan. For the single parallel-batching machine scheduling problem, some structural properties and a heuristic algorithm are developed to solve it. Since the parallel-batching machines scheduling problem is NP-hard, a hybrid CS-JADE algorithm combining improved cuckoo search algorithm (CS) and self-adaptive differential evolution (DE) is proposed to solve this problem. The computational experiments indicate that the proposed hybrid algorithm performs well both in effectiveness and efficiency.

AB The emergent ecosystems of intelligent edge devices in diverse Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, from automatic surveillance to precision agriculture, increasingly rely on recording and processing a variety of image data. Due to resource constraints, e.g., energy and communication bandwidth requirements, these applications require compressing the recorded images before transmission. For these applications, image compression commonly requires: 1) maintaining features for coarse-grain pattern recognition instead of the high-level details for human perception due to machine-to-machine communications; 2) high compression ratio that leads to improved energy and transmission efficiency; and 3) large dynamic range of compression and an easy tradeoff between compression factor and quality of reconstruction to accommodate a wide diversity of IoT applications as well as their time-varying energy/performance needs. To address these requirements, we propose, MAGIC, a novel machine learning (ML)-guided image compression framework that judiciously sacrifices the visual quality to achieve much higher compression when compared to traditional techniques, while maintaining accuracy for coarse-grained vision tasks. The central idea is to capture application-specific domain knowledge and efficiently utilize it in achieving high compression. We demonstrate that the MAGIC framework is configurable across a wide range of compression/quality and is capable of compressing beyond the standard quality factor limits of both JPEG 2000 and WebP. We perform experiments on representative IoT applications using two vision data sets and show 42.65x compression at similar accuracy with respect to the source. We highlight low variance in compression rate across images using our technique as compared to JPEG 2000 and WebP.

AB BackgroundThis paper studies the temporal consistency of health care expenditures in a large state Medicaid program. Predictive machine learning models were used to forecast the expenditures, especially for the high-cost, high-need (HCHN) patients.ResultsWe systematically tests temporal correlation of patient-level health care expenditures in both the short and long terms. The results suggest that medical expenditures are significantly correlated over multiple periods. Our work demonstrates a prevalent and strong temporal correlation and shows promise for predicting future health care expenditures using machine learning. Temporal correlation is stronger in HCHN patients and their expenditures can be better predicted. Including more past periods is beneficial for better predictive performance.ConclusionsThis study shows that there is significant temporal correlation in health care expenditures. Machine learning models can help to accurately forecast the expenditures. These results could advance the field toward precise preventive care to lower overall health care costs and deliver care more efficiently.

ID LAND-USE CHANGE
AB Understanding the dynamics of urban growth is among the most important tasks in urban planning due to their influence on policy decision-making. Specifically, prediction of urban growth at regional levels is crucial for regional policy makers. Making such predictions is difficult because of the existence of complex topological structures and the high-dimensional nature of data sets related to urban growth. Spatial and temporal auto correlation and cross-correlations, together with regional social and physical covariates, need to be properly accounted for improving the forecasting power of any statistical or machine learning method. To that end, we develop novel machine learning methodologies to perform predictions of urban growth at regional levels by incorporating lead-lag non-linear relationships among past urban changes in each region and its neighbors. Based on this analysis, machine learning algorithms outperform more classical methods, such as a logistic regression, in terms of classifying low/high urban growth regions, and the random forest algorithm seems to have the best prediction accuracy among the selected machine learning methods. Moreover, the random forest method without any external covariates has still a high prediction accuracy which not only confirms that most of variability of urban growth can be described by past observations of self and neighboring changes, but also makes it possible to perform real forecasting of urban growth without accessing any external covariates. The latter makes this modeling framework useful for local policy makers in allocating budget and directing resources appropriately based on such predictions.

AB With the dramatic growth of data in both amount and scale, distributed machine learning has become an important tool for the massive data to finish the tasks as prediction, classification, etc. However, due to the practical physical constraints and the potential privacy leakage of data, it is infeasible to aggregate raw data from all data owners for the learning purpose. To tackle this problem, the distributed privacy-preserving learning approaches are introduced to learn over all distributed data without exposing the real information. However, existing approaches have limits on the complicated distributed system. On the one hand, traditional privacy-preserving learning approaches rely on heavy cryptographic primitives on training data, in which the learning speed is dramatically slowed down due to the computation overheads. On the other hand, the complicated system architecture becomes a barrier in the practical distributed system. In this paper, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving machine learning scheme for hierarchical distributed systems. We modify and improve the collaborative learning algorithm. The proposed scheme not only reduces the overhead for the learning process but also provides the comprehensive protection for each layer of the hierarchical distributed system. In addition, based on the analysis of the collaborative convergency in different learning groups, we also propose an asynchronous strategy to further improve the learning efficiency of hierarchical distributed system. At the last, extensive experiments on real-world data are implemented to evaluate the privacy, efficacy, and efficiency of our proposed schemes.

AB Due to the ever-growing demands for electronic chips in different sectors, semiconductor companies have been mandated to offshore their manufacturing processes. This unwanted matter has made security and trustworthiness of their fabricated chips concerning and has caused the creation of hardware attacks. In this condition, different entities in the semiconductor supply chain can act maliciously and execute an attack on the design computing layers, from devices to systems. Our attack is a hardware Trojan that is inserted during mask generation/fabrication in an untrusted foundry. The Trojan leaves a footprint in the fabrication through addition, deletion, or change of design cells. To tackle this problem, we propose EVHA (Explainable Vision System for Hardware Testing and Assurance) in this work, which can detect the smallest possible change to a design in a low-cost, accurate, and fast manner. The inputs to this system are scanning electron microscopy images acquired from the integrated circuits under examination. The system output is the determination of integrated circuit status in terms of having any defect and/or hardware Trojan through addition, deletion, or change in the design cells at the cell level. This article provides an overview on the design, development, implementation, and analysis of our defense system.

ID GRASP; HISTOGRAMS
AB In this paper, an intelligent perceiving and planning system based on deep learning is proposed for a collaborative robot consisting of a 7-DoF (7-degree-of-freedom) manipulator, a three-finger robot hand, and a vision system, known as IPPS (intelligent perceiving and planning system). The lack of intelligence has been limiting the application of collaborative robots for a long time. A system to realize "eye-brain-hand" process is crucial for the true intelligence of robots. In this research, a more stable and accurate perceiving process was proposed. A well-designed camera system as the vision system and a new hand tracking method were proposed for operation perceiving and recording set establishment to improve the applicability. A visual process was designed to improve the accuracy of environment perceiving. Besides, a faster and more precise planning process was proposed. Deep learning based on a new CNN (convolution neural network) was designed to realize intelligent grasping planning for robot hand. A new trajectory planning method of the manipulator was proposed to improve efficiency. The performance of the IPPS was tested with simulations and experiments in a real environment. The results show that IPPS could effectively realize intelligent perceiving and planning for the robot, which could realize higher intelligence and great applicability for collaborative robots.

AB Asthma is not a single disease, but an umbrella term for a number of distinct diseases, each of which are caused by a distinct underlying pathophysiological mechanism. These discrete disease entities are often labelled as 'asthma endotypes'. The discovery of different asthma subtypes has moved from subjective approaches in which putative phenotypes are assigned by experts to data-driven ones which incorporate machine learning. This review focuses on the methodological developments of one such machine learning technique-latent class analysis-and how it has contributed to distinguishing asthma and wheezing subtypes in childhood. It also gives a clinical perspective, presenting the findings of studies from the past 5 years that used this approach. The identification of true asthma endotypes may be a crucial step towards understanding their distinct pathophysiological mechanisms, which could ultimately lead to more precise prevention strategies, identification of novel therapeutic targets and the development of effective personalized therapies.

AB This paper introduces a novel approach to identify at-risk students with a focus on output interpretability through analyzing learning activities at a finer granularity on a weekly basis. Specifically, this approach converts the predicted output from the former weeks into meaningful probabilities to infer the predictions in the current week for maintaining the consecutiveness among learning activities. To demonstrate the efficacy of our model in identifying at-risk students, we compare the weekly AUCs and averaged performance (i.e., accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score) over each course with the baseline models (i.e., Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree), respectively. Furthermore, we adopt a Top-K metric to examine the number of at-risk students that the model is able to identify with high precision during each week. Finally, the model output is interpreted through a model-agnostic interpretation approach to support instructors to make informed recommendations for students' learning. The experimental results demonstrate the capability and interpretability of our model in identifying at-risk students in online learning settings. In addition to that our work also provides significant implications in building accountable machine learning pipelines that can be used to automatically generated individualized learning interventions while considering fairness between different learning groups.

AB Background Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness in American adults. If detected, DR can be treated to prevent further damage causing blindness. There is an increasing interest in developing artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to help detect DR using electronic health records. The lesion-related information documented in fundus image reports is a valuable resource that could help diagnoses of DR in clinical decision support systems. However, most studies for AI-based DR diagnoses are mainly based on medical images; there is limited studies to explore the lesion-related information captured in the free text image reports. Methods In this study, we examined two state-of-the-art transformer-based natural language processing (NLP) models, including BERT and RoBERTa, compared them with a recurrent neural network implemented using Long short-term memory (LSTM) to extract DR-related concepts from clinical narratives. We identified four different categories of DR-related clinical concepts including lesions, eye parts, laterality, and severity, developed annotation guidelines, annotated a DR-corpus of 536 image reports, and developed transformer-based NLP models for clinical concept extraction and relation extraction. We also examined the relation extraction under two settings including 'gold-standard' setting-where gold-standard concepts were used-and end-to-end setting. Results For concept extraction, the BERT model pretrained with the MIMIC III dataset achieve the best performance (0.9503 and 0.9645 for strict/lenient evaluation). For relation extraction, BERT model pretrained using general English text achieved the best strict/lenient F1-score of 0.9316. The end-to-end system, BERT_general_e2e, achieved the best strict/lenient F1-score of 0.8578 and 0.8881, respectively. Another end-to-end system based on the RoBERTa architecture, RoBERTa_general_e2e, also achieved the same performance as BERT_general_e2e in strict scores. Conclusions This study demonstrated the efficiency of transformer-based NLP models for clinical concept extraction and relation extraction. Our results show that it's necessary to pretrain transformer models using clinical text to optimize the performance for clinical concept extraction. Whereas, for relation extraction, transformers pretrained using general English text perform better.

AB We report a conjugated polyelectrolyte fluorescence-based biosensor P-C-3 and a general methodology to evaluate spectral shape recognition to identify biomolecules using artificial intelligence. By using well-defined analytes, we demonstrate that the fluorescence spectral shape of P-C-3 is sensitive to minor structural changes and exhibits distinct signature patterns for different analytes. A method was also developed to select useful features to reduce computational complexity and prevent overfitting of the data. It was found that the normalized intensity of 3 to 5 selected wavelengths was sufficient for the fluorescence biosensor to classify 13 distinct nucleotides and distinguish as little as single base substitutions at distinct positions in the primary sequence of oligonucleotides rapidly with nearly 100% classification accuracy. Photophysical studies led to a model to explain the mechanism of these fluorescence spectral shape changes, which provides theoretical support for applying this method in complicated biological systems. Using the feature selection algorithm to measure the relative intensity of a few selected wavelengths significantly reduces measurement time, demonstrating the potential for fluorescence spectrum shape analysis in high-throughput and high-content screening.

AB Purpose Following the increasing trend of artificial intelligence (AI) research in hospitality literature, this critical reflection paper aims to identify AI-assisted mindfulness as a critical yet under-investigated issue and to contribute feasible directions for future research.Design/methodology/approach The authors first conceptualize a framework explaining the effects of mindfulness design in AI interventions on improving human mindfulness. The authors then identify opportunities for interventions in AI-assisted mindfulness for the tourism, hospitality and events industries. Finally, the authors propose potential themes for AI-assisted mindfulness research.Findings This study contributes three major conceptual works. First, we conceptualize a framework of AI-assisted mindfulness, showcasing that the scope of AI-assisted mindfulness spans from AI interventions to state mindfulness and then to trait mindfulness. Second, the authors offer two approaches to strategic thinking, one from mindfulness (i.e. mindfulness-focused niche markets and activities) and one from AI applications (i.e. AI-facilitated devices and platforms), to identify opportunities for AI-assisted mindfulness interventions. Third, for both management- and marketing-oriented AI-assisted mindfulness research, the authors propose 18 themes.Research limitations/implications This critical reflection paper offers directions for future knowledge creation in AI-assisted mindfulness in the tourism, hospitality and events industries.Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this critical reflection paper serves as the first in hospitality and tourism literature to systematically propose the research issue of AI-assisted mindfulness, offering directions and themes for future research.

AB This article provides an approximate online adaptive solution to the infinite-horizon optimal tracking problem for control-affine continuous-time nonlinear systems with uncertain drift dynamics. A model-based approximate dynamic programming (ADP) approach, which is facilitated using a concurrent learning-based system identifier, approximates the optimal value function. To reduce the computational complexity of model-based ADP, the state space is segmented into user-defined segments (i.e., regions). Off-policy trajectories are selected within each segment to facilitate learning of the value function weight estimates; this process is called Bellman error (BE) extrapolation. Within certain segments of the state space, sparse neural networks are used to reduce the computational expense of BE extrapolation. Discontinuities occur in the weight update laws since different groupings of extrapolated BE trajectories are active in certain regions of the state space. A Lyapunov-like stability analysis is presented to prove boundedness of the overall system in the presence of discontinuities. Simulation results are included to demonstrate the performance and validity of the developed method. The simulation results demonstrate that using the sparse, switched BE extrapolation method developed in this article reduces the computation time by 85.6% when compared to the traditional BE extrapolation method.

AB Reinforcement learning in environments with many action-state pairs is challenging. The issue is the number of episodes needed to thoroughly search the policy space. Most conventional heuristics address this search problem in a stochastic manner. This can leave large portions of the policy space unvisited during the early training stages. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-based, information-theoretic approach for performing guided stochastic searches that more effectively cover the policy space. Our approach is based on the value of information, a criterion that provides the optimal tradeoff between expected costs and the granularity of the search process. The value of information yields a stochastic routine for choosing actions during learning that can explore the policy space in a coarse to fine manner. We augment this criterion with a state-transition uncertainty factor, which guides the search process into previously unexplored regions of the policy space. We evaluate the uncertainty-based value-of-information policies on the games Centipede and Crossy Road. Our results indicate that our approach yields better performing policies in fewer episodes than stochastic-based exploration strategies. We show that the training rate for our approach can be further improved by using the policy cross entropy to guide our criterion's hyperparameter selection.

TI Deep learning for necrosis detection using canine perivascular wall
   tumour whole slide images
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
ID SOFT-TISSUE SARCOMAS; DOGS
AB Necrosis seen in histopathology Whole Slide Images is a major criterion that contributes towards scoring tumour grade which then determines treatment options. However conventional manual assessment suffers from inter-operator reproducibility impacting grading precision. To address this, automatic necrosis detection using AI may be used to assess necrosis for final scoring that contributes towards the final clinical grade. Using deep learning AI, we describe a novel approach for automating necrosis detection in Whole Slide Images, tested on a canine Soft Tissue Sarcoma (cSTS) data set consisting of canine Perivascular Wall Tumours (cPWTs). A patch-based deep learning approach was developed where different variations of training a DenseNet-161 Convolutional Neural Network architecture were investigated as well as a stacking ensemble. An optimised DenseNet-161 with post-processing produced a hold-out test F1-score of 0.708 demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. This represents a novel first-time automated necrosis detection method in the cSTS domain as well specifically in detecting necrosis in cPWTs demonstrating a significant step forward in reproducible and reliable necrosis assessment for improving the precision of tumour grading.

AB A key challenge of post-silicon validation methodology is to select a limited number of trace signals that are effective during post-silicon debug. Structural analysis used by traditional signal selection techniques are fast but lead to poor restoration quality. In contrast, simulation-based selection techniques provide superior restorability but incur significant computation overhead. While early work on machine learning based signal selection is promising [1] , it is still not applicable on large industrial designs since it needs thousands of simulations of large and complex designs. In this paper, we propose a signal selection technique that addresses the scalability issue of simulation-based techniques while maintaining a high restoration performance. The basic idea is to train a machine learning framework using a small set of circuits, and apply the trained model to the bigger circuit under test, without any need for simulating the large industry-scale designs. This paper makes two fundamental contributions: i) this is the first attempt to show that learning from small related circuits can be useful for signal selection, and ii) this is the first automated signal selection approach that is applicable on industrial designs without sacrificing restoration quality. Experimental results indicate that our approach can improve restorability by up to 135.4 percent (8.8 percent on average) while significantly reduce (up to 37X, 16.6X on average) the runtime compared to existing signal selection approaches.

AB Alpha/beta hydrolase domain-containing 5 (ABHD5), also termed CGI-58, is the key upstream activator of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), which plays an essential role in lipid metabolism and energy storage. Mutations in ABHD5 disrupt lipolysis and are known to cause the Chanarin-Dorfman syndrome. Despite its importance, the structure of ABHD5 remains unknown. In this work, we combine computational and experimental methods to build a 3D structure of ABHD5. Multiple comparative and machine learning-based homology modeling methods are used to obtain possible models of ABHD5. The results from Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics and experimental data of the apo models and their mutants are used to select the most likely model. Moreover, ensemble docking is performed on representative conformations of ABHD5 to reveal the binding mechanism of ABHD5 and a series of synthetic ligands. Our study suggests that the ABHD5 models created by deep learning-based methods are the best candidate structures for the ABHD5 protein. The mutations of E41, R116, and G328 disturb the hydrogen bonding network with nearby residues and suppress membrane targeting or ATGL activation. The simulations also reveal that the hydrophobic interactions are responsible for binding sulfonyl piperazine ligands to ABHD5. Our work provides fundamental insight into the structure of ABHD5 and its ligand-binding mode, which can be further applied to develop ABHD5 as a therapeutic target for metabolic disease and cancer.

AB Robotic teleoperation has shown great potentials in various construction applications. With the advancements of virtual telepresence and motion capture technologies, bilateral teleoperation has been tested in precision construction operations, where a human operator can drive the motion of a remote robot with their natural body motions. A significant challenge is that because of the mismatch between robot mechanic design and the human body, such as a different number of joints of a robotic arm and a human arm, the recovered robot motions driven by human hand motions may not be desired, leading to unintended consequences including collision. This study presents a proactive collision avoidance system based on the real-time prediction of human hand motions. The proposed method, Feature-based Human-Motion Prediction (FHMP), stores streaming motion data into a data pool, quantifies the spatiotemporal relationship between gaze focus and hand movement trajectories, and segments and clusters the streaming data into different pattern groups based the motion pattern similarity. Different machine learning (ML) models are trained for each of the pattern groups. During the real-time prediction, whenever a pattern change is detected, the ML model is transitioned to a new model that matches the new pattern. A data buffering approach is used to reuse the old data and old ML model for a certain period of time before the new ML model is well trained, to ensure an uninterrupted real-time prediction of human hand motions. The gaze and hand motion data of a human subject experiment (n = 120) for pipe skid maintenance was used to test the system in a virtual reality (VR) environment. The result shows that FHMP can support anticipatory collision avoidance in bilateral teleoperation with a better prediction performance. Future research could enable testing the method on real robots for more believable results. (C) 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB We introduce an interpretable deep-learning (DL) approach for direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation with a single snapshot. Classical subspace-based methods, such as multiple signal classification (MUSIC) and estimation of parameters by rotational invariant technique (ESPRIT), use spatial smoothing on uniform linear arrays (ULAs) for single-snapshot DOA estimation but face drawbacks in reduced array aperture and inapplicability to sparse arrays. Single-snapshot methods, such as compressive sensing (CS) and iterative adaptive approach (IAA), encounter challenges with high-computational costs and slow convergence, hampering real-time use. Recent DL DOA methods offer promising accuracy and speed. However, the practical deployment of deep networks is hindered by their black-box nature. To address this, we propose a deep-minimum power distortionless response (MPDR) network translating MPDR-type beamformer into DL, enhancing generalization and efficiency. Comprehensive experiments conducted using both simulated and real-world datasets substantiate its dominance in terms of inference time and accuracy in comparison with conventional methods. Moreover, it excels in terms of efficiency, generalizability, and interpretability when contrasted with other DL DOA estimation networks.

AB The problem of downscaling the effects of global scale climate variability into predictions of local hydrology has important implications for water resource management. Our research aims to identify predictive relationships that can be used to integrate solar and ocean-atmospheric conditions into forecasts of regional water flows. In recent work we have developed an induction technique called second-order table compression, in which learning can be viewed as a process that transforms a table consisting of training data into a second-order table ( which has sets of atomic values as entries) with fewer rows by merging rows in consistency preserving ways. Here, we apply the second-order table compression technique to generate predictive models of future water inflows of Lake Okeechobee, a primary source of water supply for south Florida. We also describe SORCER, a second-order table compression learning system and compare its performance with three well-established data mining techniques: neural networks, decision tree learning and associational rule mining. SORCER gives more accurate results, on the average, than the other methods with average accuracy between 49% and 56% in the prediction of inflows discretized into four ranges. We discuss the implications of these results and the practical issues in assessing the results from data mining models to guide decision-making.

AB There is a pressing need to study spatial heterogeneity of ridesourcing usage determinants to develop bettertargeted transportation and land use policies. This study incorporates spatial information (i.e., the geographic coordinates of census tracts) into the machine learning model and leverages state-of-the-art explainable machine learning techniques to analyze census-tract-to-census-tract ridesourcing usage, identify the key factors that shape the usage, and explore their nonlinear associations across different spatial contexts. Specifically, we analyze the spatial heterogeneity of ridesourcing travel in Chicago based on three spatial contexts, including downtown, neighborhood and airport. The results reveal that built environment variables collectively contribute to the largest importance for the downtown and airport context, while socioeconomic and demographic variables are the strongest predictors for the neighborhood context. Travel cost, the number of commuters and transit supply variables have evident nonlinear associations with ridesourcing usage, and these associations show strong differences across these three spatial contexts. Moreover, incorporating geographic coordinates is shown to be useful in improving model's capability to capture spatial information and thus enhance its predictive performance. These findings provide transportation professionals with location-based insights to better plan and manage ridesourcing services in Chicago.

AB Urbanization destroys green areas, prompting the need for eco-friendly policies. This study proposes "GreenPlotter," an algorithm that combines low-carbon design and artificial intelligence (AI) for sustainable urban development. The study introduces carbon sequestration in trees as a green measurable factor in automated land development. Integrating size, access, fixed facilities, and carbon of land at the urban block scale, GreenPlotter uses genetic algorithms to optimize proposed design solutions for road access networks and land partitioning. The results of the low-carbon design scenario options proved the algorithm's success in generating greener solutions. This article demonstrates that AI implementation has accelerated the design process while effectively incorporating carbon stored in trees as a measurable parameter that responds to a low-carbon design approach.

AB The next generation of telescopes will yield a substantial increase in the availability of high-quality spectroscopic data for thousands of exoplanets. The sheer volume of data and number of planets to be analyzed greatly motivate the development of new, fast, and efficient methods for flagging interesting planets for reobservation and detailed analysis. We advocate the application of machine learning (ML) techniques for anomaly (novelty) detection to exoplanet transit spectra, with the goal of identifying planets with unusual chemical composition and even searching for unknown biosignatures. We successfully demonstrate the feasibility of two popular anomaly detection methods (local outlier factor and one-class support vector machine) on a large public database of synthetic spectra. We consider several test cases, each with different levels of instrumental noise. In each case, we use receiver operating characteristic curves to quantify and compare the performance of the two ML techniques.

AB Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) is a fundamental connected vehicle application that extends Adaptive Cruise Control by exploiting vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. CACC is a crucial ingredient for numerous autonomous vehicle functionalities including platooning, distributed route management, etc. Unfortunately, malicious V2V communications can subvert CACC, leading to string instability and road accidents. In this paper, we develop a novel resiliency infrastructure, RACCON, for detecting and mitigating V2V attacks on CACC. RACCON uses machine learning to develop an on-board prediction model that captures anomalous vehicular responses and performs mitigation in real time. RACCON-enabled vehicles can exploit the high efficiency of CACC without compromising safety, even under potentially adversarial scenarios. We present extensive experimental evaluation to demonstrate the efficacy of RACCON.

AB In this study, we aimed to evaluate the performance of various machine learning (ML) classifiers to predict mode choice of movement-challenged persons (MCPs) based on data collected through a questionnaire survey of 384 respondents in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The mode choice set consisted of CNG-driven auto-rickshaw, bus, walking, motorized rickshaw, and non-motorized rickshaw, which was found as the most prominent mode used by MCPs. Age, sex, income, travel time, and supporting instrument (as an indicator of the level of disability) utilized by MCPs were explored as predictive variables. Results from the different split ratios with 10-fold cross-validation were compared to evaluate model outcomes. A split ratio of 60% demonstrates the optimum accuracy. It was found that Multi-nominal Logistic Regression (MNL), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) show higher accuracy for the split ratio of 60%. Overfitting of bus and walking as a travel mode was found as a source of classification error. Travel time was identified as the most important factor influencing the selection of walking, CNG, and rickshaw for MNL, KNN, and LDA. LDA and KNN depict the supporting instrument as a more important factor in mode choice than MNL. The selection of rickshaw as a mode follows a relatively normal probability distribution, while probability distribution is negatively skewed for the other three modes.

AB Management of diabetes requires a multifaceted approach of risk factor reduction; through management of risk factors such as glucose, blood pressure and cholesterol. Goals for these risk factors often vary and guidelines suggest that this is based on patient characteristics and need to be individualized. Evaluating risk is therefore critically important to determine goals and choose appropriate treatments.A risk engine is an analytic tool that collects a large amount of population data allowing the simulation of the progression of diabetes with set equations over a period of time. Recently, a number of data cohorts have become available, leading to the development of newer risk engines that are more dynamic and generalizable. An example is the Building, Relating, Assessing, and Validating Outcomes in (BRAVO) diabetes model which was built on the ACCORD trial database. It is capable of accurately predicting diabetes comorbidities in an international population based on calibration with international clinical trial data. It has potential uses in risk stratification of patients, evaluation of interventions and calculation of their long term cost effectiveness. Recently, it has been used to simulate long term outcomes based on short term data, using difference modelling scenarios.

TI Exploring Eating Disorder Topics on Twitter: Machine Learning Approach

AB Background: Eating disorders (EDs) are a group of mental illnesses that have an adverse effect on both mental and physical health. As social media platforms (eg, Twitter) have become an important data source for public health research, some studies have qualitatively explored the ways in which EDs are discussed on these platforms. Initial results suggest that such research offers a promising method for further understanding this group of diseases. Nevertheless, an efficient computational method is needed to further identify and analyze tweets relevant to EDs on a larger scale.
   Objective: This study aims to develop and validate a machine learning-based classifier to identify tweets related to EDs and to explore factors (ie, topics) related to EDs using a topic modeling method.
   Methods: We collected potential ED-relevant tweets using keywords from previous studies and annotated these tweets into different groups (ie, ED relevant vs irrelevant and then promotional information vs laypeople discussion). Several supervised machine learning methods, such as convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), support vector machine, and naive Bayes, were developed and evaluated using annotated data. We used the classifier with the best performance to identify ED-relevant tweets and applied a topic modeling method-Correlation Explanation (CorEx)-to analyze the content of the identified tweets. To validate these machine learning results, we also collected a cohort of ED-relevant tweets on the basis of manually curated rules.
   Results: A total of 123,977 tweets were collected during the set period. We randomly annotated 2219 tweets for developing the machine learning classifiers. We developed a CNN-LSTM classifier to identify ED-relevant tweets published by laypeople in 2 steps: first relevant versus irrelevant (F-1 score=0.89) and then promotional versus published by laypeople (F-1 score=0.90). A total of 40,790 ED-relevant tweets were identified using the CNN-LSTM classifier. We also identified another set of tweets (ie, 17,632 ED-relevant and 83,557 ED-irrelevant tweets) posted by laypeople using manually specified rules. Using CorEx on all ED-relevant tweets, the topic model identified 162 topics. Overall, the coherence rate for topic modeling was 77.07% (1264/1640), indicating a high quality of the produced topics. The topics were further reviewed and analyzed by a domain expert.
   Conclusions: A developed CNN-LSTM classifier could improve the efficiency of identifying ED-relevant tweets compared with the traditional manual-based method. The CorEx topic model was applied on the tweets identified by the machine learning-based classifier and the traditional manual approach separately. Highly overlapping topics were observed between the 2 cohorts of tweets. The produced topics were further reviewed by a domain expert. Some of the topics identified by the potential ED tweets may provide new avenues for understanding this serious set of disorders.

AB This paper introduces a parallel-batching scheduling problem with deterioration and learning effects on parallel machines, where the actual processing time of a job is subject to the phenomena of deterioration and learning. All jobs are first divided into different parallel batches, and the processing time of the batches is equal to the largest processing time of their belonged jobs. Then, the generated batches are assigned to parallel machines to be processed. Motivated by the characteristics of machine maintenance activities in a semiconductor manufacturing process, we take the machine preventive maintenance into account, i.e., the machine should be maintained after a fixed number of batches have been completed. In order to solve the problem, we analyze several structural properties with respect to the batch formation and sequencing. Based on these properties, a hybrid BRKGA-DE algorithm combining biased random-key genetic algorithm (BRKGA) and Differential Evolution (DE) is proposed to solve the parallel-batching scheduling problem. A series of computational experiments is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

TI Detection and mapping of Amaranthus spinosus L. in bermudagrass
   pastures using drone imagery and deep learning for a site-specific weed
   management
SO AGRONOMY JOURNAL

ID AGRICULTURE; GROWTH
AB Weed encroachment negatively affects pasture productivity by reducing herbage allowance, stocking rates, and livestock performance. Amaranthus spinosus L. is a weed species widely found in pastures worldwide and is considered challenging for ranchers due to its great potential for invasion, making it difficult to control. The high costs of chemical application and the global concern about environmental impacts restrict indiscriminate herbicide spraying in pastures. Site-specific weed management (SSWM) is a weed management strategy based on weed spot-spraying that has the potential to overcome these issues. Images from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can provide valuable information for weed mapping to drive the herbicide application in pastures. Deep learning techniques have been highlighted in image classification tasks. We developed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based image segmentation model based on the U-Net architecture to detect and map Amaranthus spinosus in bermudagrass pastures using red-green-blue images acquired through UAV flying in moderate-high altitude. The images were acquired from twelve paddocks under three treatments (weed-free, weed-strips, or weed-infested) during the summer (2021-2022). The CNN model was able to detect around 80% of the A. spinosus with an average prediction accuracy of 94%. Our weed mapping showed the potential of using the U-Net model to generate a herbicide application map to be inserted into the sprayer system, reducing up to 76% of the amount of herbicide applied. Further studies are encouraged to increase the robustness of the model across species and development stages and develop sprayer systems to implement the spot-spraying in field conditions.

TI Accelerating superconductor discovery through tempered deep learning of

ID LATTICE-VIBRATIONS; TEMPERATURE; LANTHANUM; HYDRIDE
AB Integrating deep learning with the search for new electron-phonon superconductors represents a burgeoning field of research, where the primary challenge lies in the computational intensity of calculating the electron-phonon spectral function, alpha 2F(omega), the essential ingredient of Midgal-Eliashberg theory of superconductivity. To overcome this challenge, we adopt a two-step approach. First, we compute alpha 2F(omega) for 818 dynamically stable materials. We then train a deep-learning model to predict alpha 2F(omega), using a training strategy tailored for limited data to temper the model's overfitting, enhancing predictions. Specifically, we train a Bootstrapped Ensemble of Tempered Equivariant graph neural NETworks (BETE-NET), obtaining an MAE of 0.21, 45 K, and 43 K for the moments derived from alpha 2F(omega): lambda, omega log\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$${\omega }_{\log }$$\end{document}, and omega 2, respectively, yielding an MAE of 2.5 K for the critical temperature, Tc. Further, we incorporate domain knowledge of the site-projected phonon density of states to impose inductive bias into the model's node attributes and enhance predictions. This methodological innovation decreases the MAE to 0.18, 29 K, and 28 K, respectively, yielding an MAE of 2.1 K for Tc. We illustrate the practical application of our model in high-throughput screening for high-Tc materials. The model demonstrates an average precision nearly five times higher than random screening, highlighting the potential of ML in accelerating superconductor discovery. BETE-NET accelerates the search for high-Tc superconductors while setting a precedent for applying ML in materials discovery, particularly when data is limited.

AB This paper introduces the serial batching scheduling problems with position-based learning effect, where the actual job processing time is a function of its position. Two scheduling problems respectively for single-machine and parallel-machine are studied, and in each problem the objectives of minimizing maximum earliness and total number of tardy jobs are both considered respectively. In the proposed scheduling models, all jobs are first partitioned into serial batches, and then all batches are processed on the serial-batching machine. We take some practical production features into consideration, i.e., setup time before processing each batch increases with the time, regarded as time-dependent setup time, and we formalize it as a linear function of its starting time. Under the single-machine scheduling setting, structural properties are derived for the problems with the objectives of minimizing maximum earliness and number of tardy jobs respectively, based on which optimization algorithms are developed to solve them. Under the parallel-machine scheduling setting, a hybrid VNS-GSA algorithm combining variable neighborhood search (VNS) and gravitational search algorithm (GSA) is proposed to solve the problems with these two objectives respectively, and the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed VNS-GSA are demonstrated and compared with the algorithms of GSA, VNS, and simulated annealing (SA). This paper demonstrates that the consideration of different objectives leads to various optimal decisions on jobs assignment, jobs batching, and batches sequencing, which generates a new insight to investigate batching scheduling problems with learning effect under single-machine and parallel-machine settings.

AB We present a high-throughput, end-to-end pipeline for organic crystal structure prediction (CSP)& horbar;the problem of identifying the stable crystal structures that will form from a given molecule based only on its molecular composition. Our tool uses neural network potentials to allow for efficient screening and structural relaxation of generated crystal candidates. Our pipeline consists of two distinct stages: random search, whereby crystal candidates are randomly generated and screened, and optimization, where a genetic algorithm (GA) optimizes this screened population. We assess the performance of each stage of our pipeline on 21 molecules taken from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre's CSP blind tests. We show that random search alone yields matches for approximate to 50% of targets. We then validate the potential of our full pipeline, making use of the GA to optimize the root-mean-square deviation between crystal candidates and the experimentally derived structure. With this approach, we are able to find matches for approximate to 80% of candidates with 10-100 times smaller initial population sizes than when using random search. Lastly, we run our full pipeline with an ANI model that is trained on a small data set of molecules extracted from crystal structures in the Cambridge Structural Database, generating approximate to 60% of targets. By leveraging machine learning models trained to predict energies at the density functional theory level, our pipeline has the potential to approach the accuracy of ab initio methods and the efficiency of empirical force fields.

AB We present a machine learning approach for accurately predicting formation energies of binary compounds in the context of crystal structure predictions. The success of any machine learning model depends significantly on the choice of representation used to encode the relevant physical information into machine-learnable data. We test different representation schemes based on partial radial and angular distribution functions (RDF+ADF) on Al-Ni and Cd-Te structures generated using our genetic algorithm for structure prediction. We observe a remarkable improvement in predictive accuracy upon transitioning from global to atom-centered representations, resulting in a threefold decrease in prediction errors. We show that a support vector regression model using a combination of atomic radial and angular distribution functions performs best at the formation energy prediction task, providing small root mean squared errors of 3.9meV/atom and 10.9meV/atom for Al-Ni and Cd-Te, respectively. We test the performance of our models against common traditional descriptors and find that RDF- and ADF-based representations significantly outperform many of those in the prediction of formation energies. The high accuracy of predictions makes our machine learning models great candidates for the exploration of energy landscapes.

AB Chronic musculoskeletal pain condition often shows poor correlations between tissue abnormalities and clinical pain. Therefore, classification of pain conditions like chronic low back pain, osteoarthritis, and fibromyalgia depends mostly on self report and less on objective findings like X-ray or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes. However, recent advances in structural and functional brain imaging have identified brain abnormalities in chronic pain conditions that can be used for illness classification. Because the analysis of complex and multivariate brain imaging data is challenging, machine learning techniques have been increasingly utilized for this purpose. The goal of machine learning is to train specific classifiers to best identify variables of interest on brain MRIs (i.e., biomarkers). This report describes classification techniques capable of separating MRI-based brain biomarkers of chronic pain patients from healthy controls with high accuracy (70-92%) using machine learning, as well as critical scientific, practical, and ethical considerations related to their potential clinical application. Although self-report remains the gold standard for pain assessment, machine learning may aid in the classification of chronic pain disorders like chronic back pain and fibromyalgia as well as provide mechanistic information regarding their neural correlates.

AB Organizations across the world, including NATO, OECD, the WHO, and the United Nations, as well as many governments, are now employing guidelines for safe, secure, and trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI). While technology policies are still being formulated, many AI applications catered toward children have already been developed or are still developing. While designing any child-centered AI, it is utmost importance to keep the children's privacy at the forefront. One modality for child-centered AI is speech/language communication, which has found applications in various educational technologies, tutoring services, as well as interactive learning and social robots. Although, short of a full de-identification of speech segments, longer duration sentences and audio content could reveal partial neutral identifying information (e.g., gender of a child, etc.), but if taken in longer duration context with sequenced longitudinal data (e.g., audio recordings over full days at home or in classrooms, and linked over time), privacy concerns will grow and be critical. Motivated by a privacy-preserving design, this study explores the use of discrete speech units as a form of anonymous encoding, to develop Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems for children that better ensure privacy protection. The primary goal here is to ascertain that discrete speech units retain the key linguistic information for the ASR task of output text creation, but simultaneously lack identifying speaker-specific information, or the ability to potentially re-generate the original speech waveform given the available sequence of discrete speech units. Here, a Discrete ASR model trained on the My Science Tutor Children's Conversational Speech Corpus (MyST) archives an output word-error-rate (WER) of 15.7%. Our Discrete ASR model achieves similar performance in terms of WER when compared to state-of-the-art End-to-End (E2E) ASR models trained using features extracted from large-scale self-supervised pre-trained speech processing model (such as WavLM), although it is noted that E2E ASR models are almost 10 times larger in model checkpoint memory size and number of model parameters and takes 3x the amount of time to train. In addition, open-domain testing on other popular child speech corpora confirms that the proposed Discrete ASR models perform equal to E2E ASR models for corpora containing children speech in the same age range as MyST (e.g., CMU corpus) and slightly lower performance for a corpus containing a wider age range of children (e.g., OGI corpus). Finally, this study also shows that child ASR using the proposed discrete speech units achieves promising performance in recognizing WH-Words, Nouns, Verbs, and Pronouns in an early childhood case study of teacher-child interactions in a childcare facility, involving preschool children with and without speech/language delays which is an extremely vulnerable and challenging speech/language assessment population.

AB Recently, deep neural networks have demonstrated comparable and even better performance than board-certified ophthalmologists in well-annotated datasets. However, the diversity of retinal imaging devices poses a significant challenge: domain shift, which leads to performance degradation when applying the deep learning models trained on one domain to new testing domains. In this paper, we propose a domain adaptation framework comprising of multi-scale inputs along with multiple domain adaptors applied hierarchically in both feature and output spaces. The proposed training strategy and novel unsupervised domain adaptation framework, called Collaborative Adversarial Domain Adaptation (CADA), can effectively overcome the domain shift challenge. Multi-scale inputs can reduce the information loss due to the pooling layers used in the network for feature extraction, while our proposed CADA is an interactive paradigm that presents an exquisite collaborative adaptation through both adversarial learning and ensembling weights at different network layers. In particular, to produce a better prediction for the unlabeled target domain data, we simultaneously achieve domain invariance and model generalizability via adversarial learning at multi-scale outputs from different levels of network layers and maintaining an exponential moving average (EMA) of the historical weights during training. Without annotating any sample from the target domain, multiple adversarial losses in encoder and decoder layers guide the extraction of domain-invariant features to confuse the domain classifier. Meanwhile, the ensembling of weights via EMA reduces the uncertainty of adapting multiple discriminator learning. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our CADA model incorporating multi-scale input training can overcome performance degradation and outperform state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods in segmenting retinal optic disc and cup from fundus images stemming from the REFUGE, Drishti-GS, and Rim-One-r3 datasets.

AB Objective. The purpose of this project was to determine whether machine-learning classifiers could predict which patients would require a preoperative acute pain service (APS) consultation. Design. Retrospective cohort. Setting. University teaching hospital. Subjects. The records of 9,860 surgical patients posted between January 1 and June 30, 2010 were reviewed. Outcome Measures. Request for APS consultation. A cohort of machine-learning classifiers was compared according to its ability or inability to classify surgical cases as requiring a request for a preoperative APS consultation. Classifiers were then optimized utilizing ensemble techniques. Computational efficiency was measured with the central processing unit processing times required for model training. Classifiers were tested using the full feature set, as well as the reduced feature set that was optimized using a merit-based dimensional reduction strategy. Results. Machine-learning classifiers correctly predicted preoperative requests for APS consultations in 92.3% (95% confidence intervals [CI], 91.892.8) of all surgical cases. Bayesian methods yielded the highest area under the receiver operating curve (0.87, 95% CI 0.840.89) and lowest training times (0.0018 seconds, 95% CI, 0.00170.0019 for the NaiveBayesUpdateable algorithm). An ensemble of high-performing machine-learning classifiers did not yield a higher area under the receiver operating curve than its component classifiers. Dimensional reduction decreased the computational requirements for multiple classifiers, but did not adversely affect classification performance. Conclusions. Using historical data, machine-learning classifiers can predict which surgical cases should prompt a preoperative request for an APS consultation. Dimensional reduction improved computational efficiency and preserved predictive performance.

AB Design and manufacturing of integrated circuits predominantly use a globally distributed semiconductor supply chain involving diverse entities. The modern semiconductor supply chain has been designed to boost production efficiency, but is filled with major security concerns such as malicious modifications (hardware Trojans), reverse engineering (RE), and cloning. While being deployed, digital systems are also subject to a plethora of threats such as power, timing, and electromagnetic (EM) side channel attacks. Many Design-for-Security (DFS) solutions have been proposed to deal with these vulnerabilities, and such solutions (DFS) relays on strategic modifications (e.g., logic locking, side channel resilient masking, and dummy logic insertion) of the digital designs for ensuring a higher level of security. However, most of these DFS strategies lack robust formalism, are often not human-understandable, and require an extensive amount of human expert effort during their development/use. All of these factors make it difficult to keep up with the ever growing number of microelectronic vulnerabilities. In this work, we propose X-DFS, an explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) guided DFS isolution-space exploration approach that can dramatically cut down the mitigation strategy development/use time while enriching our understanding of the vulnerability by providing human-understandable decision rationale. We implement X-DFS and comprehensively evaluate it for reverse engineering threats (SAIL, SWEEP, and OMLA) and formalize a generalized mechanism for applying X-DFS to defend against other threats such as hardware Trojans, fault attacks, and side channel attacks for seamless future extensions.

AB The image-based detection and classification of plant diseases has become increasingly important to the development of precision agriculture. We consider the case of tomato, a high-value crop supporting the livelihoods of many farmers around the world. Many biotic and abiotic plant health issues impede the efficient production of this crop, and laboratory-based diagnostics are inaccessible in many remote regions. Early detection of these plant health issues is essential for efficient and accurate response, prompting exploration of alternatives for field detection. Considering the availability of low-cost smartphones, artificial intelligence-based classification facilitated by mobile phone imagery can be a practical option. This study introduces a smartphone-attachable 30x microscopic lens, used to produce the novel tomato microimaging data set of 8,500 images representing 34 tomato plant conditions on the upper and lower sides of leaves as well as on the surface of tomato fruits. We introduce TOMMicroNet, a 14-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to classify biotic and abiotic plant health issues, and we compare it against six existing pretrained CNN models. We compared two separate pipelines of grouping data for training TOMMicroNet, either presenting all data at once or separating the data into subsets based on the three parts of the plant. Comparing configurations based on cross-validation and F1 scores, we determined that TOMMicroNet attained the highest performance when trained on the complete data set, with 95% classification accuracy on both training and external data sets. Given TOMMicroNet's capabilities when presented with unfamiliar data, this approach has potential for the identification of plant health issues.

AB IntroductionOverall performance of machine learning-based prediction models is promising; however, their generalizability and fairness must be vigorously investigated to ensure they perform sufficiently well for all patients. ObjectiveThis study aimed to evaluate prediction bias in machine learning models used for predicting acute postoperative pain. MethodWe conducted a retrospective review of electronic health records for patients undergoing orthopedic surgery from June 1, 2011, to June 30, 2019, at the University of Florida Health system/Shands Hospital. CatBoost machine learning models were trained for predicting the binary outcome of low (& LE;4) and high pain (>4). Model biases were assessed against seven protected attributes of age, sex, race, area deprivation index (ADI), speaking language, health literacy, and insurance type. Reweighing of protected attributes was investigated for reducing model bias compared with base models. Fairness metrics of equal opportunity, predictive parity, predictive equality, statistical parity, and overall accuracy equality were examined. ResultsThe final dataset included 14,263 patients [age: 60.72 (16.03) years, 53.87% female, 39.13% low acute postoperative pain]. The machine learning model (area under the curve, 0.71) was biased in terms of age, race, ADI, and insurance type, but not in terms of sex, language, and health literacy. Despite promising overall performance in predicting acute postoperative pain, machine learning-based prediction models may be biased with respect to protected attributes. ConclusionThese findings show the need to evaluate fairness in machine learning models involved in perioperative pain before they are implemented as clinical decision support tools.

AB Supervised machine-learning (SML) algorithms are potentially powerful tools that may be used for screening cows for infectious diseases such as bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infection. Here, we compared six different SML algorithms to identify the most important risk factors for predicting BLV seropositivity in dairy cattle in Florida. We used a dataset of 1279 dairy blood sample records from the Bronson Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory that were submitted for BLV antibody testing from 2012 to 2022. The SML algorithms that we used were logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), gradient boosting (GB), random forest (RF), neural network (NN), and support vector machine (SVM). A total of 312 serum samples were positive for BLV with corrected seroprevalence of 26.0 %. Subject to limitations of the analyzed retrospective data, the RF model was the best model for predicting BLV seropositivity in dairy cattle indicated by the highest Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic of 0.75, area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.93, gain of 2.6; and lowest misclassification rate of 0.10. The LR model was the worst. The RF model showed that the best predictors for BLV seropositivity were age (dairy cows of age >= 5 years) and geographic location (southern Florida). We concluded that the RF and other SML algorithms hold promise for predicting BLV seropositivity in dairy cattle and that dairy cattle 5 years of age or older raised in southern Florida have a higher likelihood of testing positive for BLV. This study makes an important methodological contribution to the needed development of predictive tools for effective screening for BLV infection and emphasizes the importance of collecting and using representative data in such predictive models.

DE EHR; Deep learning; Predictive modeling; RNN
AB Recently, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been applied in predicting disease onset risks with Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. While these models demonstrated promising results on relatively small data sets, the generalizability and transferability of those models and its applicability to different patient populations across hospitals have not been evaluated. In this study, we evaluated an RNN model, RETAIN, over Cerner Health Facts (R) EMR data, for heart failure onset risk prediction. Our data set included over 150,000 heart failure patients and over 1,000,000 controls from nearly 400 hospitals. Convincingly, RETAIN achieved an AUC of 82% in comparison to an AUC of 79% for logistic regression, demonstrating the power of more expressive deep learning models for EHR predictive modeling. The prediction performance fluctuated across different patient groups and varied from hospital to hospital. Also, we trained RETAIN models on individual hospitals and found that the model can be applied to other hospitals with only about 3.6% of reduction of AUC. Our results demonstrated the capability of RNN for predictive modeling with large and heterogeneous EHR data, and pave the road for future improvements.

AB Uncertainty is a concept associated with data acquisition and analysis, usually appearing in the form of noise or measure error, often due to some technological constraint. In supervised learning, uncertainty affects classification accuracy and yields low quality solutions. For this reason, it is essential to develop machine learning algorithms able to handle efficiently data with imprecision. In this paper we study this problem from a robust optimization perspective. We consider a supervised learning algorithm based on generalized eigenvalues and we provide a robust counterpart formulation and solution in case of ellipsoidal uncertainty sets. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed robust scheme on artificial and benchmark datasets from University of California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository and we compare results against a robust implementation of Support Vector Machines.

AB Comparing with traditional learning criteria, such as mean square error, the minimum error entropy (MEE) criterion is superior in nonlinear and non-Gaussian signal processing and machine learning. The argument of the logarithm in Renyi's entropy estimator, called information potential (IP), is a popular MEE cost in information theoretic learning. The computational complexity of IP is, however, quadratic in terms of sample number due to double summation. This creates the computational bottlenecks, especially for large-scale data sets. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose an efficient quantization approach to reduce the computational burden of IP, which decreases the complexity from O(N-2) to O(MN) with M << N. The new learning criterion is called the quantized MEE (QMEE). Some basic properties of QMEE are presented. Illustrative examples with linear-in-parameter models are provided to verify the excellent performance of QMEE.

AB The seed coat sculpture is one of the most important taxonomic distinguishing features. The objective of this study is to classify coat patterns of Allium L. seeds into new groups using scanning electron microscopy unsupervised machine learning. Selected images of seed coat patterns from more than 100 Allium species described in literature and data from our samples were classified into seven types of anticlinal (irregular curved, irregular curved to nearly straight, straight, S, U, U to Omega, and Omega) and five types of periclinal walls (granule, small verrucae, large verrucae, marginal verrucae, and verrucate verrucae). We used five unsupervised machine learning approaches: K-means, K-means++, Minibatch K-means, Spectral, and Birch. The elbow and silhouette approaches were then used to determine the number of clusters required. Thereafter, we compared human- and machine-based results and proposed a new clustering. We then separated the data into six target clusters: SI, SS, SM, NS, PS, and PD. The proposed strongly identical grouping is distinct from the other groups in that the results are exactly the same, but PD is unrelated to the others. Thus, unsupervised machine learning has been shown to support the development of new groups in the Allium seed coat pattern.
