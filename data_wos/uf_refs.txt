TI Bridging the artificial intelligence valley of death in surgical

SO SURGERY

DT Editorial Material
AB Artificial intelligence has underdelivered in improving health care. In 1970, a New England Journal of Medicine special article projected that computer science would augment or replace many intellectual functions of physicians.1 Over the past 50 years, surgical literature has been similarly optimistic despite a paucity of highlevel supporting evidence. The corresponding author may be guilty of perpetuating this disproportionate optimism. This article seeks to balance the discussion surrounding artificial intelligence in surgical decision-making by describing major barriers and potential solutions toward safe, effective clinical adoption of artificial intelligence-enabled decision-support platforms in surgery. Artificial intelligence decision support in surgery has largely

AB Artificial intelligence, as a nonhuman entity, is increasingly used to inform, direct, or supplant nursing care and clinical decision-making. The boundaries between human- and nonhuman-driven nursing care are blurred with the advent of sensors, wearables, camera devices, and humanoid robots at such an accelerated pace that the critical evaluation of its influence on patient safety has not been fully assessed. Since the pivotal release of To Err is Human, patient safety is being challenged by the dynamic healthcare environment like never before, with nursing at a critical juncture to steer the course of artificial intelligence integration in clinical decision-making. This paper presents an overview of artificial intelligence and its application in healthcare and highlights the implications which affect nursing as a profession, including perspectives on nursing education and training recommendations. The legal and policy challenges which emerge when artificial intelligence influences the risk of clinical errors and safety issues are discussed.

AB Purpose of review Acute kidney injury (AKI) affects nearly 60% of all patients admitted to ICUs. Large volumes of clinical, monitoring and laboratory data produced in ICUs allow the application of artificial intelligence analytics. The purpose of this article is to assimilate and critically evaluate recently published literature regarding artificial intelligence applications for predicting, diagnosing and subphenotyping AKI among critically ill patients. Recent findings Among recent studies regarding artificial intelligence implementations for predicting, diagnosing and subphenotyping AKI among critically ill patients, there are many promising models, but few had external validation, clinical interpretability and high predictive performance. Deep learning techniques leveraging multimodal clinical data show great potential to provide continuous, accurate, early predictions of AKI risk, which could be implemented clinically to optimize preventive and early therapeutic management strategies. Use of consensus criteria, standard definitions and common data models could facilitate access to machine learning-ready data sets for external validation. The lack of interpretability, explainability, fairness and transparency of artificial intelligence models hinder their entrustment and clinical implementation; compliance with standardized reporting guidelines can mitigate these challenges.

AB Electronic healthcare technology is widespread around the world and creates massive potential to improve clinical outcomes and transform care delivery. However, there are increasing concerns with respect to the cyber vulnerabilities of medical tools, malicious medical errors, and security attacks on healthcare data and devices. Increased connectivity to existing computer networks has exposed the medical devices/systems and their communicating data to new cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Adversaries leverage the state-of-the-art technologies, in particular artificial intelligence and computer vision-based techniques, in order to launch stronger and more detrimental attacks on the medical targets. The medical domain is an attractive area for cybercrimes for two fundamental reasons: (a) it is rich resource of valuable and sensitive data; and (b) its protection and defensive mechanisms are weak and ineffective. The attacks aim to steal health information from the patients, manipulate the medical information and queries, maliciously change the medical diagnosis, decisions, and prescriptions, etc. A successful attack in the medical domain causes serious damage to the patient's health and even death. Therefore, cybersecurity is critical to patient safety and every aspect of the medical domain, while it has not been studied sufficiently. To tackle this problem, new human- and computer-based countermeasures are researched and proposed for medical attacks using the most effective software and hardware technologies, such as artificial intelligence and computer vision. This review provides insights to the novel and existing solutions in the literature that mitigate cyber risks, errors, damage, and threats in the medical domain. We have performed a scoping review analyzing the four major elements in this area (in order from a medical perspective): (1) medical errors; (2) security weaknesses of medical devices at software- and hardware-level; (3) artificial intelligence and/or computer vision in medical applications; and (4) cyber attacks and defenses in the medical domain. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence and computer vision are key topics in this review and their usage in all these four elements are discussed. The review outcome delivers the solutions through building and evaluating the connections among these elements in order to serve as a beneficial guideline for medical electronic hardware security.

DT Article
AB Clinical prediction models based on artificial intelligence algorithms can potentially improve patient care, reduce errors, and add value to the health care system. However, their adoption is hindered by legitimate economic, practical, professional, and intellectual concerns. This article explores these barriers and highlights well-studied instruments that can be used to overcome them. Adopting actionable predictive models will require the purposeful incorporation of patient, clinical, technical, and administrative perspectives. Model developers must articulate a priori clinical needs, ensure explainability and low error frequency and severity, and promote safety and fairness. Models themselves require ongoing validation and monitoring to address variations in health care settings and must comply with an evolving regulatory environment. Through these principles, surgeons and health care providers can leverage artificial intelligence to optimize patient care. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose This study aims to examine consumers' perception of artificial intelligence (AI) and AI marketing communication. Design/methodology/approach Twenty in-depth interviews were conducted to collect data and phenomenological reduction was used to analyze data. Findings Findings suggest that consumers' interpretation of AI is multidimensional and relational with a focus on functionality and emotion, as well as comparison and contrast between AI and human beings; consumers' perception of voice-assisted AI centers on the aspects of function, communication, adaptation, relationship and privacy; consumers consider AI marketing communication to be unavoidable and generally acceptable; and consumers believe that AI marketing communication to be limited in its effect on influencing their evaluation of products/brands or shaping their consumptive behaviors. Originality/value According to the authors' knowledge, this study is the first research project to gauge consumers' perception on AI and AI marketing communication.

In order for teachers to develop the knowledge and skills, and have the self-efficacy for using AI in instruction, they must be well prepared and informed of what AI is (and what it is not) and its potential role in K-12 education. This study explored teachers' (mis)conceptions relative to their intentional and informal learning. Our research provides important implications for teacher preparation and in-service professional development regarding AI in our society and implementation of AI tools and processes in K-12 education.

AB Interest in the potential applications of artificial intelligence in medicine, anesthesiology, and the world at large has never been higher. The Anesthesia Research Council steering committee formed an anesthesiologist artificial intelligence expert workgroup charged with evaluating the current state of artificial intelligence in anesthesiology, providing examples of future artificial intelligence applications and identifying barriers to artificial intelligence progress. The workgroup's findings are summarized here, starting with a brief introduction to artificial intelligence for clinicians, followed by overviews of current and anticipated artificial intelligence-focused research and applications in anesthesiology. Anesthesiology's progress in artificial intelligence is compared to that of other medical specialties, and barriers to artificial intelligence development and implementation in our specialty are discussed. The workgroup's recommendations address stakeholders in policymaking, research, development, implementation, training, and use of artificial intelligence-based tools for perioperative care.

AB Building energy use prediction plays an important role in building energy management and conservation as it can help us to evaluate building energy efficiency, conduct building commissioning, and detect and diagnose building system faults. Building energy prediction can be broadly classified into engineering, Artificial Intelligence (AI) based, and hybrid approaches. While engineering and hybrid approaches use thermodynamic equations to estimate energy use, the AI-based approach uses historical data to predict future energy use under constraints. Owing to the ease of use and adaptability to seek optimal solutions in a rapid manner, the AI-based approach has gained popularity in recent years. For this reason and to discuss recent developments in the AI based approaches for building energy use prediction, this paper conducts an in-depth review of single AI-based methods such as multiple linear regression, artificial neural networks, and support vector regression, and ensemble prediction method that, by combining multiple single AI-based prediction models improves the prediction accuracy manifold. This paper elaborates the principles, applications, advantages and limitations of these AI-based prediction methods and concludes with a discussion on the future directions of the research on AI-based methods for building energy use prediction.

AB The purpose of this exploratory research study was to examine the roles instructional designers (IDs) play in the integration of generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) into their higher education institutions, and how they use GenAI technologies in their own professional practices. Data were collected from 15 participants in the United States (U.S.) in an ID role or with similar job titles (e.g., educational technologist). Using a general qualitative approach, semi- structured interviews were conducted in Zoom about IDs' use and integration of GenAI. Our analysis resulted in three primary themes related to IDs' inte gration of GenAI in online and blended education: (a) the use of GenAI for instructional design; (b) collaborative guidance for faculty integration of GenAI; and (c) training, resources, and guidelines on the integration of GenAI. A common thread through a ll the themes was IDs' conscientious and cautious approach and ethical concerns about GenAI integration. We unpack these themes and discuss the implications of IDs in higher education integrating GenAI to meet organizational, faculty, and student needs.

AB The implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology has shown significant promise in the identification of acute intracranial hemorrhages (ICHs). However, it is crucial to recognize that AI systems may produce false-positive results, especially in the postoperative period. Here, we present two cases where AI prioritization software erroneously identified an acute ICH on a postoperative non-contrast CT. These cases highlight the need for a more careful radiology review of AI-flagged images in postoperative patients to avoid further unnecessary imaging and unwarranted concerns from radiologists, clinicians, and patients.

AB in case of the shortages and limitations in solving the problem of construction site layout, there is a need for simulation prior to work commencement. By using a combination of Expert System (ES) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) technology, a new methodology for solving this problem has been developed. This system applies hybrid intelligence technology, and is presented in this text. Based on site investigation and analysis of effective factors in site layout, a hybrid intelligence model and system, named Hybrid System for Site Layout (HSSL), was developed. The evolution of this concept and its mechanism of integration are delineated in this text, so as to allow the reader to have an overview of its content, while at the same time providing for the specifics of how the system operates.

AB IoT systems are used for performing a variety of essential tasks in wide-ranging sectors, such as healthcare, smart cities, agriculture, and industrial automation. Most of these systems incorporate smartness for intelligent decision making using artificial intelligence (AI) approaches. To reduce the network bandwidth usage and load on the cloud server, there is a push to relegate most of these AI-related computations to edge IoT devices/systems. Hence, to ensure good performance, the edge devices must be systematically designed with an emphasis on the respective AI requirements from exploration to deployment. State-of-the-art IoT device and system design practices place little importance on the AI specifications during the early stages of the system development resulting in systems, which are unable to meet the AI specifications without additional redesigning and optimization efforts. In this letter, we propose an automated framework for AI-rooted IoT system design approach, where the AI specifications play a vital role in deciding the system components, design, and implementation from a very early stage of the design life cycle. The proposed framework employs an expert system and a machine-readable knowledge-base to automate the design process. Using a set of case studies, we demonstrate the benefits of the proposed framework.

AB This systematic review examines the empirical literature published between 2014 and 2021 that situates artificial intelligence within K-12 educational contexts. Our review synthesizes 12 articles and highlights artificial intelligence's instructional contexts and applications in K-12 learning environments. We focused our synthesis on the learning contexts and the learner-interface interactions. Our findings highlight that most of intelligent systems are being deployed in math or informal settings. Also, there are opportunities for more collaboration to facilitate teaching and learning in domain-specific areas. Additionally, researchers can explore how to implement more collaborative learning opportunities between intelligent tutors and learners. We conclude with a discussion of the reciprocal nature of this technology integration.

AB Help-seeking is a valuable practice in online discussion forums. However, the asynchronicity and information overload of online discussion forums have made it challenging for help seekers and providers to connect effectively. This study formulated a new method to provide fair and accurate insights toward building a peer recommender to support help-seeking in online learning. Specifically, we developed the fair network embedding (Fair-NE) model and compared it with existing popular models. We trained and evaluated the models with a large dataset consisting of 187,450 discussion post-reply pairs by 10,182 Algebra I online learners from 2015 to 2020. Finally, we examined models with representation fairness, predictive accuracy, and predictive fairness. The results showed that the Fair-NE can achieve superior fairness in genders and races while retaining competitive predictive accuracy. This study marks a paradigm change from previous investigation and evaluation of fair artificial intelligence to proactively build fair artificial intelligence in education.

AB Previous research has assumed uniformity in user response to service robots regardless of user profile. This study sought to understand the nature of human-robot interactions in a competitive setting by applying the diffusion of innovation theory. Through a survey of 447 sports betting patrons, we used unsupervised learning to cluster the patrons based on human/robot interaction, relational and psychological variables, usage intention, and socioeconomic information. Four clusters were identified: Tech laggards, Optimists, Skeptics, and Enthusiasts. Trust was a key determining factor of cluster membership, especially among frequent betters. Further, the study examined each cluster through the lens of psychological theories and ethical perspectives, identified associated risks, and offered mitigation strategies. Practical implications are discussed.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly gaining prominence as a crucial technology to transform and reshape the field of urban planning. However, several unanswered questions persist regarding the potential impacts of AI on urban and regional planning research and practice, as well as the issues involved and the appropriate responses and plans. This paper aims to address these concerns in the AI-enabled planning process and accordingly create a typology of urban planning AI to categorize and outline the progression of AI in urban planning, ranging from AI-assisted and AI-augmented planning to AI-automated and eventually AI-autonomized planning, based on a scoping literature review.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) offers potential solutions to optimize agricultural production and sustainability. This study examined American perceptions and attitudes toward AI applications in the food and agriculture systems, assessing both public optimism and concerns. Using a mixed-methods approach grounded in online ethnography and survey analysis, we identified five primary themes influencing public support for AI in agriculture: Knowledge of AI in agriculture, trust in scientific experts in agriculture and food production, concerns about using AI in agriculture, health concerns about agriculture and food production, and general attitudes toward AI technology itself. Findings indicated moderate public knowledge about AI's agricultural applications, with higher support correlating with trust in agricultural scientists and awareness of health benefits linked to AI innovations. Conversely, concerns over privacy, data security, and potential job displacement contribute to hesitancy. Our regression model further highlights the significance of these themes with demographic factors. This study indicated the need for AI stakeholders to address knowledge gaps and ethical considerations, emphasizing transparent data practices and clear communication of AI in enhancing agricultural sustainability. These insights offer valuable directions for future research and policy-making, promoting a balanced approach to integrating AI in agriculture that is responsive to public sentiment and ethical standards.

AB Key advances
   A deep recurrent neural network model using data from electronic health records enables the prediction of inpatient episodes of acute kidney injury (AKI) with lead times of up to 48 hours5. Integrating intraoperative physiological signals into an AKI risk model that dynamically integrates preoperative and intraoperative data improves the prediction of postoperative AKI6. A convolutional deep learning model enables the noninvasive classification of chronic kidney disease stage and estimated glomerular filtration rate using kidney ultrasound images8. A convolutional neural network trained for multiclass segmentation enables automated analysis of transplant biopsy and nephrectomy samples9.
   Artificial intelligence is increasingly being used to improve diagnosis and prognostication for acute and chronic kidney diseases. Studies with this objective published in 2019 relied on a variety of available data sources, including electronic health records, intraoperative physiological signals, kidney ultrasound imaging, and digitized biopsy specimens.

ID TUTORING SYSTEMS
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are poised to become an increasingly important part of education in the anatomical sciences. OpenAI has also introduced generative pretrained transformers (GPTs), which are customizable versions of the standard ChatGPT application. There is little research that has explored the potential of GPTs to serve as intelligent tutoring systems for learning the anatomical sciences. The objective of this study was to describe the design and explore the performance of AnatomyGPT, a customized artificial intelligence application intended for anatomical sciences education. The AnatomyGPT application was configured with GPT Builder by uploading open-source textbooks as knowledge sources and by providing pedagogical instructions for how to interact with users. The performance of AnatomyGPT was compared with ChatGPT by evaluating the responses of both applications to prompts of the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) sample items with respect to accuracy, rationales, and citations. AnatomyGPT achieved high scores on the NBME sample items for Gross Anatomy, Embryology, Histology, and Neuroscience and scored comparably to ChatGPT. In addition, AnatomyGPT provided several citations in the responses that it generated, while ChatGPT provided none. Both GPTs provided rationales for all sample items. The customized AnatomyGPT application demonstrated preliminary potential as an intelligent tutoring system by generating responses with increased citations as compared with the standard ChatGPT application. The findings of this study suggest that instructors and students may wish to create their own custom GPTs for teaching and learning anatomy. Future research is needed to further develop and characterize the potential of GPTs for anatomy education.

AB Machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches have revolutionized multiple disciplines, including toxicology. This review summarizes representative recent applications of machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches in different areas of toxicology, including physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling, quantitative structure-activity relationship modeling for toxicity prediction, adverse outcome pathway analysis, high-throughput screening, toxicogenomics, big data, and toxicological databases. By leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches, now it is possible to develop PBPK models for hundreds of chemicals efficiently, to create in silico models to predict toxicity for a large number of chemicals with similar accuracies compared with in vivo animal experiments, and to analyze a large amount of different types of data (toxicogenomics, high-content image data, etc.) to generate new insights into toxicity mechanisms rapidly, which was impossible by manual approaches in the past. To continue advancing the field of toxicological sciences, several challenges should be considered: (1) not all machine learning models are equally useful for a particular type of toxicology data, and thus it is important to test different methods to determine the optimal approach; (2) current toxicity prediction is mainly on bioactivity classification (yes/no), so additional studies are needed to predict the intensity of effect or dose-response relationship; (3) as more data become available, it is crucial to perform rigorous data quality check and develop infrastructure to store, share, analyze, evaluate, and manage big data; and (4) it is important to convert machine learning models to user-friendly interfaces to facilitate their applications by both computational and bench scientists.

AB Media exposure can shape audience perceptions surrounding novel innovations, such as artificial intelligence (AI), and could influence whether they share information about AI with others online. This study examines the indirect association between exposure to AI in the media and information sharing about AI online. We surveyed 567 US citizens aged 18 and older in November 2020, several months after the release of Open AI's transformative GPT-3 model. Results suggest that AI media exposure was related to online information sharing through psychological proximity to the impacts of AI and positive AI performance expectancy in serial mediation. This positive indirect association became stronger the more an individual perceived society to be changing due to new technology. Results imply that public exposure to AI in the media could significantly impact public understanding of AI, and prompt further information sharing online.

In this work, a technique for data acquisition and image processing was developed utilizing small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), multispectral imaging, and deep learning convolutional neural networks to evaluate phenotypic characteristics on citrus crops. This low-cost and automated high-throughput phenotyping technique utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to: (i) detect, count, and geolocate trees and tree gaps; (ii) categorize trees based on their canopy size; (iii) develop individual tree health indices; and (iv) evaluate citrus varieties and rootstocks. The proposed remote sensing technique was able to detect and count citrus trees in a grove of 4,931 trees, with precision and recall of 99.9% and 99.7%, respectively, estimate their canopy size with overall accuracy of 85.5%, and detect, count, and geolocate tree gaps with a precision and recall of 100% and 94.6%, respectively. This UAV-based technique provides a consistent, more direct, cost-effective, and rapid method to evaluate phenotypic characteristics of citrus varieties and rootstocks.

AB Technological advances in omics evaluation, bioinformatics, and artificial intelligence have made us rethink ways to improve patient outcomes. Collective quantification and characterization of biological data including genomics, epigenomics, metabolomics, and proteomics is now feasible at low cost with rapid turnover. Significant advances in the integration methods of these multiomics data sets by machine learning promise us a holistic view of disease pathogenesis and yield biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis. Using machine learning tools and algorithms, it is possible to integrate multiomics data with clinical information to develop predictive models that identify risk before the condition is clinically apparent, thus facilitating early interventions to improve the health trajectories of the patients. In this review, we intend to update the readers on the recent developments related to the use of artificial intelligence in integrating multiomic and clinical data sets in the field of perinatology, focusing on neonatal intensive care and the opportunities for precision medicine. We intend to briefly discuss the potential negative societal and ethical consequences of using artificial intelligence in healthcare. We are poised for a new era in medicine where computational analysis of biological and clinical data sets will make precision medicine a reality. Impact Biotechnological advances have made multiomic evaluations feasible and integration of multiomics data may provide a holistic view of disease pathophysiology. Artificial Intelligence and machine learning tools are being increasingly used in healthcare for diagnosis, prognostication, and outcome predictions. Leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning tools for integration of multiomics and clinical data will pave the way for precision medicine in perinatology.

AB Despite the importance of product repairability, current methods for assessing and grading repairability are limited, which hampers the efforts of designers, remanufacturers, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and repair shops. To improve the efficiency of assessing product repairability, this study introduces two artificial intelligence (AI) based approaches. The first approach is a supervised learning framework that utilizes object detection on product teardown images to measure repairability. Transfer learning is employed with machine learning architectures such as ConvNeXt, GoogLeNet, ResNet50, and VGG16 to evaluate repairability scores. The second approach is an unsupervised learning framework that combines feature extraction and cluster learning to identify product design features and group devices with similar designs. It utilizes an oriented FAST and rotated BRIEF feature extractor (ORB) along with k-means clustering to extract features from teardown images and categorize products with similar designs. To demonstrate the application of these assessment approaches, smartphones are used as a case study. The results highlight the potential of artificial intelligence in developing an automated system for assessing and rating product repairability.

AB Developing artificial intelligence (AI) equitably necessitates understanding how nonexperts conceptualize and share news about technoscientific risk. We examine a model predicting AI information sharing online from an interaction of framing strategies, through psychological proximity to the impacts of AI and perceived AI risk. A panel of N = 412 participants were exposed to either a control message; or one of four manipulated messages related to AI risks. Contrary to expectations, thematically framed explicit risk news primed psychological proximity compared to both a control message and episodic frame condition. Meanwhile, episodic explicit risk frames did not prime psychological proximity over a control message. These results contest the notion that episodic frames should be associated with psychological proximity to a risk over more general framing strategies. Our results support prior research suggesting that where risk-news primes psychological proximity, the decrease in distance is in-turn associated with greater risk perception and increased likelihood of news sharing online.

AB Most conventional sprayers apply agrochemicals uniformly, despite the fact that distribution of weeds is typically patchy, resulting in wastage of valuable compounds, increased costs, crop damage risk, pest resistance to chemicals, environmental pollution and contamination of products. To reduce these negative impacts, a smart sprayer was designed and developed utilizing machine vision and artificial intelligence to distinguish target weeds from non-target objects (e.g. vegetable crops) and precisely spray on the desired target/location. Two different experimental scenarios were designed to simulate a vegetable field and to evaluate the smart sprayer's performance. The first scenario contained artificial weeds (targets) and artificial plants (non-targets). The second and most challenging scenario contained real plants; portulaca weeds as targets, and sedge weeds and pepper plants as non-targets. Two different embedded graphics processing unit (GPU) were evaluated as the smart sprayer processing unit (for image processing and target detection). The more powerful GPU (NVIDIA GTX 1070 Ti) achieved an overall precision of 71% and recall of 78% (for plant detection and target spraying accuracy) on the most challenging scenario with real plants, and 91% accuracy and recall for the first scenario with artificial plants. The less powerful GPU (NVIDIA Jetson TX2) achieved an overall precision and recall of 90% and 89% respectively on the first scenario with artificial plants, and 59% and 44% respectively on the second scenario with real plants. Finally, an RTK GPS was connected to the smart sprayer and an algorithm was developed to automatically generate weed maps and visualize the collected data (after every application). This smart technology integrates a state of the art (AI-based) weed detection system, a novel fast and precision spraying system, and a weed mapping system. It can significantly reduce the quantity of agrochemicals required, especially compared with traditional broadcast sprayers that usually treat the entire field, resulting in unnecessary application to areas that do not require treatment. It could also reduce costs, risk of crop damage and excess herbicide residue, as well as potentially reduce environmental impact.

AB In recent years, strategies for load monitoring have been proposed to mitigate power consumption. It has been found, in several reported studies, that as more information is provided for consumers about their electricity consumption, more power energy conservation will occur. In this way, Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) has been studied and applied in real-life applications. It consists of detecting and classifying appliances on/off states by measuring electrical signals only at one location of the residential consumer. Several studies have been made using different techniques to improve the accuracy of this strategy. In this paper electromagnetic transients are taking into account and, a performance analysis between cutting-edge artificial classifiers is made. It has been found that 1D convolutional neural networks perform better for this case and electrical current signals are more suitable for NILM, once it carries more features than voltage and power signals.

AB This review describes the weaknesses of traditional clinical decision-support systems and proposes that artificial intelligence should be used to augment surgical decision-making.
   Importance Surgeons make complex, high-stakes decisions under time constraints and uncertainty, with significant effect on patient outcomes. This review describes the weaknesses of traditional clinical decision-support systems and proposes that artificial intelligence should be used to augment surgical decision-making. Observations Surgical decision-making is dominated by hypothetical-deductive reasoning, individual judgment, and heuristics. These factors can lead to bias, error, and preventable harm. Traditional predictive analytics and clinical decision-support systems are intended to augment surgical decision-making, but their clinical utility is compromised by time-consuming manual data management and suboptimal accuracy. These challenges can be overcome by automated artificial intelligence models fed by livestreaming electronic health record data with mobile device outputs. This approach would require data standardization, advances in model interpretability, careful implementation and monitoring, attention to ethical challenges involving algorithm bias and accountability for errors, and preservation of bedside assessment and human intuition in the decision-making process. Conclusions and Relevance Integration of artificial intelligence with surgical decision-making has the potential to transform care by augmenting the decision to operate, informed consent process, identification and mitigation of modifiable risk factors, decisions regarding postoperative management, and shared decisions regarding resource use.

AB The next generation of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled nephrology will leverage generalist models that link diverse multimodal patient data with the linguistic and emergent capabilities of large language models. In 2023, advances in AI that linked novel unstructured data with physiological and clinical characteristics moved the field closer to realizing this vision.
   The launch of ChatGPT1 was an important step in the democratization of artificial intelligence (AI); large language models will have a critical role in shaping future research and AI-augmented clinical practice in nephrology.An automated quantitative histopathological morphometry approach, termed pathomics, reliably predicted the progression of kidney diseases8; this technology represents an important step towards precision medicine.An AI system reliably estimated biomarkers of systemic diseases, including estimated glomerular filtration rate, from external retinal photographs9; this approach offers new opportunities for noninvasive, inexpensive and scalable screening for kidney disease in low-resource settings.A deep learning analysis of blood-flow sounds detected arteriovenous fistula stenoses in patients on haemodialysis with comparable performance to an expert nephrologist performing a physical examination10; this approach has the potential for patient-facing applications.

AB Brain-inspired computing hardware aims to emulate the structure and working principles of the brain and could be used to address current limitations in artificial intelligence technologies. However, brain-inspired silicon chips are still limited in their ability to fully mimic brain function as most examples are built on digital electronic principles. Here we report an artificial intelligence hardware approach that uses adaptive reservoir computation of biological neural networks in a brain organoid. In this approach-which is termed Brainoware-computation is performed by sending and receiving information from the brain organoid using a high-density multielectrode array. By applying spatiotemporal electrical stimulation, nonlinear dynamics and fading memory properties are achieved, as well as unsupervised learning from training data by reshaping the organoid functional connectivity. We illustrate the practical potential of this technique by using it for speech recognition and nonlinear equation prediction in a reservoir computing framework.
   A living artificial intelligence hardware approach that uses the adaptive reservoir computation of biological neural networks in a brain organoid can perform tasks such as speech recognition and nonlinear equation prediction.

AB Based on deep mediatization theory and artificial intelligence (AI) technology, this study explores the effective improvement of museums' social media communication by applying Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) technology. Firstly, the social media content from four different museums is collected, a dataset containing tens of thousands of images is constructed, and a CNN-based model is designed for automatic identification and classification of image content. The model is trained and tested through a series of experiments, evaluating its performance in enhancing museums' social media communication. Experimental results indicate that the CNN model significantly enhances user participation, access rates, retention rates, and sharing rates of content. Specifically, user participation increased from 15 to 25%, reflecting a 66.7% rise. Content coverage increased from 20 to 35%, showing a 75% increase. User retention rate rose from 10 to 20%, indicating a 100% increase. Content sharing rate increased from 5 to 15%, reflecting a 200% rise. Additionally, the study discusses the model's performance across various museum types, batch sizes, and learning rate settings, verifying its robustness and wide applicability.

TI Community-engaged artificial intelligence research: A scoping review
SO PLOS DIGITAL HEALTH
LA English
DT Review
ID HEALTH; RISK
AB The degree to which artificial intelligence healthcare research is informed by data and stakeholders from community settings has not been previously described. As communities are the principal location of healthcare delivery, engaging them could represent an important opportunity to improve scientific quality. This scoping review systematically maps what is known and unknown about community-engaged artificial intelligence research and identifies opportunities to optimize the generalizability of these applications through involvement of community stakeholders and data throughout model development, validation, and implementation. Embase, PubMed, and MEDLINE databases were searched for articles describing artificial intelligence or machine learning healthcare applications with community involvement in model development, validation, or implementation. Model architecture and performance, the nature of community engagement, and barriers or facilitators to community engagement were reported according to PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. Of approximately 10,880 articles describing artificial intelligence healthcare applications, 21 (0.2%) described community involvement. All articles derived data from community settings, most commonly by leveraging existing datasets and sources that included community subjects, and often bolstered by internet-based data acquisition and subject recruitment. Only one article described inclusion of community stakeholders in designing an application-a natural language processing model that detected cases of likely child abuse with 90% accuracy using harmonized electronic health record notes from both hospital and community practice settings. The primary barrier to including community- derived data was small sample sizes, which may have affected 11 of the 21 studies (53%), introducing substantial risk for overfitting that threatens generalizability. Community engagement in artificial intelligence healthcare application development, validation, or implementation is rare. As healthcare delivery occurs primarily in community settings, investigators should consider engaging community stakeholders in user-centered design, usability, and clinical implementation studies to optimize generalizability.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed society in many ways. AI in medicine has the potential to improve medical care and reduce healthcare professional burnout but we must be cautious of a phenomenon termed "AI hallucinations" and how this term can lead to the stigmatization of AI systems and persons who experience hallucinations. We believe the term "AI misinformation" to be more appropriate and avoids contributing to stigmatization. Healthcare professionals can play an important role in AI's integration into medicine, especially regarding mental health services, so it is important that we continue to critically evaluate AI systems as they emerge.

AB As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to embed itself in our daily lives, many focus on the threats it poses to privacy, security, due process, and democracy itself But beyond these legitimate concerns, AI promises to optimize activities, increase efficiency, and enhance the accuracy and efficacy of the many aspects of society relying on predictions and likelihoods. In short, its most promising applications may come, not from uses affecting civil liberties and the social fabric of our society, but from those particularly complex technical problems lying beyond our ready human capacity. Climate change is one such complex problem, requiring fundamental changes to our transportation, agricultural, building, and energy sectors. This Article argues for the enhanced use of AI to address climate change, using the energy sector to exemplify its potential promise and pitfalls. The Article then analyzes critical policy tradeoffs that may be associated with an increased use of AI and argues for its disciplined use in a way that minimizes its limitations while harnessing its benefits to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.

DE Artificial intelligence; Retinopathy of prematurity
ID BURDEN
AB Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a potentially blinding disease in premature neonates that requires a skilled workforce for diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment. Artificial intelligence is a valuable tool that clinicians employ to reduce the screening burden on ophthalmologists and neonatologists and improve the detection of treatment-requiring ROP. Neural networks such as convolutional neural networks and deep learning (DL) systems are used to calculate a vascular severity score (VSS), an important component of various risk models. These DL systems have been validated in various studies, which are reviewed here. Most importantly, we discuss a promising study that validated a DL system that could predict the development of ROP despite a lack of clinical evidence of disease on the first retinal examination. Additionally, there is promise in utilizing these systems through telemedicine in more rural and resource-limited areas. This review highlights the value of these DL systems in early ROP diagnosis.

AB Breast cancer ranks top incidence rate among all malignant tumors for women, globally. Early detection through regular preliminary screening is critical to decreasing the breast cancer's fatality rate. However, the promotion of preliminary screening faces major limitations of human diagnosis capacity, cost, and technical reliability in China and most of the world. To meet these challenges, we developed a solution featuring an innovative division of labor model by incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) with ultrasonography and cloud computing. The objective of this research was to develop a solution named "Dr.J", which applies AI to process real-time video live feed from ultrasonography, which is physically safe and more suitable for Asian women. It can automatically detect and highlight the suspected breast cancer lesions and provide BI-RADS (Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System) ratings to assist human diagnosis. "Dr.J" does not require its frontline operators to have prior medical or IT background and thus significantly lowers manpower threshold for preliminary screening promotion. Furthermore, its cloud computing platform can store detailed breast cancer data such as images and BI-RADS ratings for further essential needs in medical treatment, research and health management, etc. as well as establishing a hierarchy medical service network for this disease. Therefore, "Dr.J" significantly enhances the availability and accessibility of preliminary screening service for breast cancer at grassroots.

AB As datasets increase in size and complexity, biomechanists have turned to artificial intelligence (AI) to aid their analyses. This paper explores how explainable AI (XAI) can enhance the interpretability of biomechanics data derived from musculoskeletal simulations. We use machine learning to classify the simulated lateral pinch data as belonging to models with healthy or one of two types of surgically altered wrists. This simulation-based classification task is analogous to using biomechanical movement and force data to clinically diagnose a pathological state. The XAI describes which musculoskeletal features best explain the classifications and, in turn, the pathological states, at both the local (individual decision) level and global (entire algorithm) level. We demonstrate that these descriptions agree with assessments in the literature and additionally identify the blind spots that can be missed with traditional statistical techniques.

AB Hydrology relates to many complex challenges due to climate variability, limited resources, and especially, increased demands on sustainable management of water and soil. Conventional approaches often cannot respond to the integrated complexity and continuous change inherent in the water system; hence, researchers have explored advanced data-driven solutions. This review paper revisits how artificial intelligence (AI) is dramatically changing the most important facets of hydrological research, including soil and land surface modeling, streamflow, groundwater forecasting, water quality assessment, and remote sensing applications in water resources. In soil and land modeling, AI techniques could further enhance accuracy in soil texture analysis, moisture estimation, and erosion prediction for better land management. Advanced AI models could also be used as a tool to forecast streamflow and groundwater levels, therefore providing valuable lead times for flood preparedness and water resource planning in transboundary basins. In water quality, AI-driven methods improve contamination risk assessment, enable the detection of anomalies, and track pollutants to assist in water treatment processes and regulatory practices. AI techniques combined with remote sensing open new perspectives on monitoring water resources at a spatial scale, from flood forecasting to groundwater storage variations. This paper's synthesis emphasizes AI's immense potential in hydrology; it also covers the latest advances and future prospects of the field to ensure sustainable water and soil management.

AB Traditional sensing technologies in specialty crops production, for pest and disease detection and field phenotyping, rely on manual sampling and are time consuming and labor intensive. Since availability of personnel trained for field scouting is a major problem, small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with various sensors can simplify the surveying procedure, decrease data collection time, and reduce cost. To accurate and rapidly process, analyze and visualize data collected from UAVs and other platforms (e.g. small airplanes, satellites, ground platforms), a cloud and artificial intelligence (AI) based application (named Agroview) was developed. This interactive and user-friendly application can: (i) detect, count and geo-locate plants and plant gaps (locations with dead or no plants); (ii) measure plant height and canopy size (plant inventory); (iii) develop plant health (or stress) maps. In this study, the use of this Agroview application to evaluate phenotypic characteristics of citrus trees (as a case study) is presented. It was found, that this emerging technology detected citrus trees with mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 2.3% in a commercial citrus orchard with 175,977 trees (1,871 acres; 39 normal and high-density spacing blocks). Furthermore, it accurately estimated tree height with 4.5% and 12.93% MAPE for normal and high-density spacing respectively, and canopy size with MAPE of 12.9% and 34.6% for normal and high-density spacing respectively. It provides a consistent, more direct, costeffective and rapid method for field survey and plant phenotyping.

AB The main idea of Less is more approach (LIMA) is using as fewer as possible ingredients to provide the best possible outcome. This approach has been used successfully almost in all the scientific and art disciplines. Recently, the idea has also been successfully explored in solving hard optimization problems. In this note we first define the dominance relation between two algorithms that includes their simplicity as well. Then we propose the general LIMA algorithm and discuss automatic ways to include common ingredients of all search algorithms, increasing the algorithms complexity in a systematic way. That kind of approach may represent a road from Optimization to Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning. Finally, we illustrate LIMA algorithm on two optimization problems and show its efficiency.

AB In this systematic review, we synthesize ten empirical peer-reviewed articles published between 2019 and 2023 that used generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) for automated feedback in higher education. There are significant opportunities and challenges to integrate these tools effectively into learning environments as the demand for timely and personalized feedback grows. We examine the articles based on instructional contexts and system characteristics, identifying critical implementation possibilities for GenAI in automated feedback. Our findings reveal that GenAI provides diverse feedback across various contexts with multiple instructional purposes. GenAI systems can reduce instructor workload by automating routine grading and feedback tasks, allowing educators to focus on more complex teaching responsibilities with augmented capabilities. Additionally, these systems enhance communication, offer cognitive and emotional support, and improve accessibility by creating supportive, stress-free learning environments. Overall, implementing GenAI automated feedback systems improves educational outcomes and creates a more efficient and supportive learning environment for students and instructors. We conclude with future research directions to better integrate GenAI with human instruction by reconsidering instructors' roles, especially in providing feedback to create more effective educational experiences.

DT Article
ID PERFORMANCE
AB As opportunities for artificial intelligence to augment surgical care expand, the accompanying surge in published literature has generated both substantial enthusiasm and grave concern regarding the safety and efficacy of artificial intelligence in surgery. For surgeons and surgical data scientists, it is increasingly important to understand the state-of-the-art, recognize knowledge and technology gaps, and critically evaluate the deluge of literature accordingly. This article summarizes the experiences and perspectives of a global, multi-disciplinary group of experts who have faced development and implementation challenges, overcome them, and produced incipient evidence thereof. Collectively, evidence suggests that artificial intelligence has the potential to augment surgeons via decision-support, technical skill assessment, and the semi-autonomous performance of tasks ranging from resource allocation to patching foregut defects. Most applications remain in preclinical phases. As technologies and their implementations improve and positive evidence accumulates, surgeons will face professional imperatives to lead the safe, effective clinical implementation of artificial intelligence in surgery. Substantial challenges remain; recent progress in using artificial intelligence to achieve performance advantages in surgery suggests that remaining challenges can and will be overcome.

AB This paper presents the results of a simulation model regarding the productivity and safety working space for construction workers through the floors of a building using swarm intelligence (SI), a field of artificial intelligence (AI), and specifically using artificial bee colony (ABC) optimization. After designing the algorithm used to build the simulation model, the simulation was used in an actual building project by comparing the travel times of workers conventionally transporting material with another group working on routes optimized by the algorithm. Thus, the proposed algorithm provides routes combining shorter travel times and correct distances between workers when transporting materials in a construction site, handling the interference between crews. After validating the algorithm on-site, no statistically significant differences were found between the travel times of workers and the times delivered by the algorithm. Additionally, the travel times using the routes obtained through the algorithm were significantly lower than those made by workers who moved freely without a predefined route. In summary, the algorithm proposed may help construction practitioners maintain safe movements that respond to hazard contexts imposed by any restriction that demands a safety distance.

AB Extracellular Vesicles (EVs), particularly exosomes, recently exploded into nanomedicine as an emerging drug delivery approach due to their superior biocompatibility, circulating stability, and bioavailability in vivo. However, EV heterogeneity makes molecular targeting precision a critical challenge. Deciphering key molecular drivers for controlling EV tissue targeting specificity is in great need. Artificial intelligence (AI) brings powerful prediction ability for guiding the rational design of engineered EVs in precision control for drug delivery. This review focuses on cutting-edge nano-delivery via integrating large-scale EV data with AI to develop AI-directed EV therapies and illuminate the clinical translation potential. We briefly review the current status of EVs in drug delivery, including the current frontier, limitations, and considerations to advance the field. Subsequently, we detail the future of AI in drug delivery and its impact on precision EV delivery. Our review discusses the current universal challenge of standardization and critical considerations when using AI combined with EVs for precision drug delivery. Finally, we will conclude this review with a perspective on future clinical translation led by a combined effort of AI and EV research.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Progress in developing therapies for the maintenance of endogenous insulin secretion in, or the prevention of, type 1 diabetes has been hindered by limited animal models, the length and cost of clinical trials, difficulties in identifying individuals who will progress faster to a clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, and heterogeneous clinical responses in intervention trials. Classic placebo-controlled intervention trials often include monotherapies, broad participant populations and extended follow-up periods focused on clinical endpoints. While this approach remains the 'gold standard' of clinical research, efforts are underway to implement new approaches harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning to accelerate drug discovery and efficacy testing. Here, we review emerging approaches for repurposing agents used to treat diseases that share pathogenic pathways with type 1 diabetes and selecting synergistic combinations of drugs to maximise therapeutic efficacy. We discuss how emerging multi-omics technologies, including analysis of antigen processing and presentation to adaptive immune cells, may lead to the discovery of novel biomarkers and subsequent translation into antigen-specific immunotherapies. We also discuss the potential for using artificial intelligence to create 'digital twin' models that enable rapid in silico testing of personalised agents as well as dose determination. To conclude, we discuss some limitations of artificial intelligence and machine learning, including issues pertaining to model interpretability and bias, as well as the continued need for validation studies via confirmatory intervention trials.

AB BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) has become an increasingly prominent tool in the field of neurosurgery, revolutionizing various aspects of patient care and surgical practices. AI-powered systems can provide real-time feedback to surgeons, enhancing precision and reducing the risk of complications during surgical procedures. The objective of this study is to review the role of AI in training neurosurgical residents, improving accuracy during surgery, and reducing complications. METHODS: The literature search method involved searching PubMed using relevant keywords to identify English literature publications, including full texts, and concerning human subject matter from its inception until May 2024, initially generating 247,747 results. Articles were then screened for topic relevancy by abstract contents. Further articles were retrieved from the sources cited by the initially reviewed articles. A comprehensive review was then performed on various studies, including observational studies, case-control studies, cohort studies, clinical trials, meta-analyses, and reviews by 4 reviewers individually and then collectively. RESULTS: Studies on AI in neurosurgery reach more than 4000 produced over a decade alone. The majority of studies regarding clinical diagnosis, risk prediction, and intraoperative guidance remain retrospective in nature. In its current form, AI-based paradigm performed inferiorly to neurosurgery residents in test taking. CONCLUSIONS: AI has potential for broad applications in neurosurgery from use as a diagnostic, predictive, intraoperative, or educational tool. Further research is warranted for prospective use of AI-based technology for delivery of neurosurgical care.

AB IntroductionArtificial intelligence can recognize complex patterns in large datasets. It is a promising technology to advance heart failure practice, as many decisions rely on expert opinions in the absence of high-quality data-driven evidence. MethodsWe searched Embase, Web of Science, and PubMed databases for articles containing "artificial intelligence," "machine learning," or "deep learning" and any of the phrases "heart transplantation," "ventricular assist device," or "cardiogenic shock" from inception until August 2022. We only included original research addressing post heart transplantation (HTx) or mechanical circulatory support (MCS) clinical care. Review and data extraction were performed in accordance with PRISMA-Scr guidelines. ResultsOf 584 unique publications detected, 31 met the inclusion criteria. The majority focused on outcome prediction post HTx (n = 13) and post durable MCS (n = 7), as well as post HTx and MCS management (n = 7, n = 3, respectively). One study addressed temporary mechanical circulatory support. Most studies advocated for rapid integration of AI into clinical practice, acknowledging potential improvements in management guidance and reliability of outcomes prediction. There was a notable paucity of external data validation and integration of multiple data modalities. ConclusionOur review showed mounting innovation in AI application in management of MCS and HTx, with the largest evidence showing improved mortality outcome prediction.

AB Purpose Following the increasing trend of artificial intelligence (AI) research in hospitality literature, this critical reflection paper aims to identify AI-assisted mindfulness as a critical yet under-investigated issue and to contribute feasible directions for future research.Design/methodology/approach The authors first conceptualize a framework explaining the effects of mindfulness design in AI interventions on improving human mindfulness. The authors then identify opportunities for interventions in AI-assisted mindfulness for the tourism, hospitality and events industries. Finally, the authors propose potential themes for AI-assisted mindfulness research.Findings This study contributes three major conceptual works. First, we conceptualize a framework of AI-assisted mindfulness, showcasing that the scope of AI-assisted mindfulness spans from AI interventions to state mindfulness and then to trait mindfulness. Second, the authors offer two approaches to strategic thinking, one from mindfulness (i.e. mindfulness-focused niche markets and activities) and one from AI applications (i.e. AI-facilitated devices and platforms), to identify opportunities for AI-assisted mindfulness interventions. Third, for both management- and marketing-oriented AI-assisted mindfulness research, the authors propose 18 themes.Research limitations/implications This critical reflection paper offers directions for future knowledge creation in AI-assisted mindfulness in the tourism, hospitality and events industries.Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this critical reflection paper serves as the first in hospitality and tourism literature to systematically propose the research issue of AI-assisted mindfulness, offering directions and themes for future research.

AB The precise pathophysiology, prevention and treatment of what is commonly diagnosed as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) disease has been elusive. This bears at least partial responsibility for lack of progress in preventative strategies. A clear unambiguous definition that represents a discrete disease is not currently available and likely is a major component of difficulties with understanding a discrete pathophysiology. It is thus becoming increasingly clear that our current paradigm of NEC as a distinct disease is incorrect and the ambiguity in what is being referred to as NEC may be a reason for our lack of progress in prevention. Because of this, we need to critically review our current concepts, how they have evolved in the past several decades and determine how we can best re-evaluate intestinal injuries and dysfunctions that are currently being called NEC. In this review, we discuss historical aspects of NEC as well as our current concepts and a potential pathway using newly developed artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) and multiomic integrations for a paradigm shift that will alter our strategies for early prediction, diagnostics, prevention, and treatment of the various forms of intestinal injury and dysfunction currently referred to as NEC. This will represent a major challenge but is critical if we are to make progress.

AB Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States as well as worldwide. Radiologists and physicians experience heavy daily workloads, thus are at high risk for burn-out. To alleviate this burden, this narrative literature review compares the performance of four different artificial intelligence (AI) models in lung nodule cancer detection, as well as their performance to physicians/radiologists reading accuracy.
   A total of 648 articles were selected by two experienced physicians with over 10 years of experience in the fields of pulmonary critical care, and hospital medicine. The data bases used to search and select the articles are PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane library, Google Scholar, Web of science, IEEEXplore, and DBLP. The articles selected range from the years between 2008 and 2019. Four out of 648 articles were selected using the following inclusion criteria: 1) 18-65 years old, 2) CT chest scans, 2) lung nodule, 3) lung cancer, 3) deep learning, 4) ensemble and 5) classic methods. The exclusion criteria used in this narrative review include: 1) age greater than 65 years old, 2) positron emission tomography (PET) hybrid scans, 3) chest X-ray (CXR) and 4) genomics. The model performance outcomes metrics are measured and evaluated in sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve, and the area under the curve (AUC).
   This hybrid deep-learning model is a state-of-the-art architecture, with high-performance accuracy and low false-positive results. Future studies, comparing each model accuracy at depth is key. Automated physician-assist systems as this model in this review article help preserve a quality doctor-patient relationship.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques have been increasingly used in several fields to improve performance and the level of automation. In recent years, this use has exponentially increased due to the advancement of high-performance computing and the ever increasing size of data. One of such fields is that of hardware design-specifically the design of digital and analog integrated circuits, where AI/ ML techniques have been extensively used to address ever-increasing design complexity, aggressive time to market, and the growing number of ubiquitous interconnected devices. However, the security concerns and issues related to integrated circuit design have been highly overlooked. In this article, we summarize the state-of-the-art in AI/ML for circuit design/optimization, security and engineering challenges, research in security-aware computer-aided design/electronic design automation, and future research directions and needs for using AI/ML for security-aware circuit design.

AB Urbanization destroys green areas, prompting the need for eco-friendly policies. This study proposes "GreenPlotter," an algorithm that combines low-carbon design and artificial intelligence (AI) for sustainable urban development. The study introduces carbon sequestration in trees as a green measurable factor in automated land development. Integrating size, access, fixed facilities, and carbon of land at the urban block scale, GreenPlotter uses genetic algorithms to optimize proposed design solutions for road access networks and land partitioning. The results of the low-carbon design scenario options proved the algorithm's success in generating greener solutions. This article demonstrates that AI implementation has accelerated the design process while effectively incorporating carbon stored in trees as a measurable parameter that responds to a low-carbon design approach.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) utilizes computer algorithms to carry out tasks with human-like intelligence. Convolutional neural networks, a type of deep learning AI, can classify basal cell carcinoma, seborrheic keratosis, and conventional nevi, highlighting the potential for deep learning algorithms to improve diagnostic workflow in dermatopathology of highly routine diagnoses. Additionally, convolutional neural networks can support the diagnosis of melanoma and may help predict disease outcomes. Capabilities of machine learning in dermatopathology can extend beyond clinical diagnosis to education and research. Intelligent tutoring systems can teach visual diagnoses in inflammatory dermatoses, with measurable cognitive effects on learners. Natural language interfaces can instruct dermatopathology trainees to produce diagnostic reports that capture relevant detail for diagnosis in compliance with guidelines. Furthermore, deep learning can power computation- and population-based research. However, there are many limitations of deep learning that need to be addressed before broad incorporation into clinical practice. The current potential of AI in dermatopathology is to supplement diagnosis, and dermatopathologist guidance is essential for the development of useful deep learning algorithms. Herein, the recent progress of AI in dermatopathology is reviewed with emphasis on how deep learning can influence diagnosis, education, and research.

AB Design and manufacturing of integrated circuits predominantly use a globally distributed semiconductor supply chain involving diverse entities. The modern semiconductor supply chain has been designed to boost production efficiency, but is filled with major security concerns such as malicious modifications (hardware Trojans), reverse engineering (RE), and cloning. While being deployed, digital systems are also subject to a plethora of threats such as power, timing, and electromagnetic (EM) side channel attacks. Many Design-for-Security (DFS) solutions have been proposed to deal with these vulnerabilities, and such solutions (DFS) relays on strategic modifications (e.g., logic locking, side channel resilient masking, and dummy logic insertion) of the digital designs for ensuring a higher level of security. However, most of these DFS strategies lack robust formalism, are often not human-understandable, and require an extensive amount of human expert effort during their development/use. All of these factors make it difficult to keep up with the ever growing number of microelectronic vulnerabilities. In this work, we propose X-DFS, an explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) guided DFS isolution-space exploration approach that can dramatically cut down the mitigation strategy development/use time while enriching our understanding of the vulnerability by providing human-understandable decision rationale. We implement X-DFS and comprehensively evaluate it for reverse engineering threats (SAIL, SWEEP, and OMLA) and formalize a generalized mechanism for applying X-DFS to defend against other threats such as hardware Trojans, fault attacks, and side channel attacks for seamless future extensions.

ID MODEL
AB Infrastructure systems in the United States are aging and considerable investment is needed to renew and replace a significant proportion of the existing systems. Piping systems, which are used in many infrastructure systems such as the distribution networks for utilities - water, sewage, gas, oil, etc., are very important in this regard. Real time scheduling is an important and necessary task in the planning and execution of construction projects. This is of particular importance in the installation of pipe systems, for which it is time consuming to plan and coordinate between team members the detailed requirements and information for the generation of practical installation schedules. During the installation stage, there can be delays or interference that could lead to the failure of the initial schedule plan. Current approaches are time-consuming, not automated and do not provide real-time schedules. Thus, the process is still fragmented and essentially manual, with inefficient information flow. To effectively improve the installation schedule, current knowledge of the installation site situation is important, with this knowledge being used to generate realistic schedules. Artificial intelligence (AI) maximizes the value of data by learning from previous cases and facilitates decision-making by making the process smarter and automatic. This paper proposes a new AI framework with machine learning (ML) and heuristic optimization techniques for automating practical pipe system installation schedule generation and optimization. A BIM model is used as reference to provide pipe system component information. A hybrid knowledge-based system is developed to integrate data-driven knowledge base and site-driven knowledge base on pipe system installation. K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) ML techniques are adapted to map extracted components with the installation activities and their requirements for installation based on knowledge obtained from industry experts and piping codes. In addition, a heuristic algorithm is adopted to optimize the installation schedule. Finally, an optimal installation schedule that minimizes overlapping activities, time and cost is suggested.

DT Article
DE apparatus; theme; mood; artificial intelligence; electracy
AB Apparatus theory (a hybrid of McLuhan and Derrida) hypothesizes that a civiliza-tion of electracy (the digital apparatus) must learn how to thrive in a lifeworld in which the visceral faculty of appetite is hegemonic. The dominant axis of behavior today is fantasy -anxi-ety (attraction/repulsion). We propose that world theming has created a vernacular discourse that may be raised to a second power of expression as vehicle of visceral intelligence. The immediate claim is that theming in digital media augments mood (ambiance) into a power of imagination, just as dialectic in writing augmented logic into a power of reason. Fantasy today is persuasive, just as logical entailment is (was) in the rational order of literacy. Decisions de-termining real events today are being made in worlds of mood.World theming is evident in the vernacular art practices arising from recent advanc-es in artificial intelligence. The availability of commodity GPUs, along with public access to advanced research via GitHub, Kaggle, Hugging Face, and the proliferation of forums such as Reddit, Discord, YouTube, and others, has resulted in a renaissance of public engagement with technology-informed creative practice. In addition, the general availability of Google's previously internal-only development tool, Colab, in late 2017 provided access to cloud-based GPUs and storage systems accessible only to data scientists and academics. In early 2021 Ryan Murdock released a Colab notebook called Big Sleep that combined Ope-nAI's recently published Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) with BigGAN. This model is a paradigmatic example of our observation. By early 2022, multiple derivations of this process incorporated alternative image generation techniques. This paper will demonstrate how the fundamental basis of these methods are distinctly electrate in their use of 'theme' and emphasis on 'mood' in world-building, including a case-study animation called Dissipative Off-ramps.

AB Considering the advancement of generative artificial intelligence and the mental health challenges faced by hospitality employees, this study proposes and tests a scenario of counseling hospitality employees using conversational AI chatbots in a mobile app. Survey data were collected from 553 hospitality employees in Japan. Findings reveal that employees' expected psychological safety of AI chatbots can be improved by AI chatbots' cuteness of appearance and emotional capability, and their expected service quality in using AI chatbots can be enhanced by cuteness of appearance, emotional capability, and psychological safety. The service quality of AI chatbots then causes their use intention, which then strengthens their willingness to recommend and help colleagues' usage of AI chatbots for counseling. Moreover, employees' general app fatigue can moderate the effects of AI chatbots' cuteness of appearance on psychological safety and service quality. This study offers valuable practical implications for developing conversational AI chatbots for hospitality employees.

AB Artificial intelligence algorithms can learn by assimilating information from large datasets in order to decipher complex associations, identify previously undiscovered pathophysiological states, and construct prediction models. There has been tremendous interest and increased incorporation of artificial intelligence into various industries, including healthcare. As a result, there has been an exponential rise in the number of research articles and industry partici-pants producing models intended for a variety of applications in medical imaging, which can be challenging to navigate for radiologists. In thoracic imaging, multiple applications are being evaluated for chest radiography and computed tomography and include applications for lung nodule evaluation and cancer imaging, quantifying diffuse lung disorders, and cardiac imaging, to name a few. This review aims to provide an overview of current clinical AI models, focusing on the most common clinical applications of AI in cardiothoracic imaging.Semin Roentgenology 58:184-195 (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB The steps of artificial intelligence in healthcare can be described and visualized from development to widespread use as a lifecycle. Viewing healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) as a lifecycle can help identify and address the ethical issues that arise at each step. This approach addresses barriers in healthcare AI resulting from how people in different positions vary in their interests and perceptions related to AI, which can lead to challenges in how ethical issues are addressed. In this paper, we have built a sample lifecycle using the elements of previously existing lifecycles, filling in gaps to be more comprehensive. We then show how ethical issues arise at different points and present example questions that should be considered throughout the lifecycle. We then use the process of examining ethical issues through the lens of the lifecycle and apply it to 3 case studies. This approach to examining the ethical issues can be applied by people in various positions, including developers of an AI system to end-users, to facilitate communication among different stakeholders to anticipate and address problems.

AB Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) in dermatology have demonstrated the potential to improve the accuracy of skin cancer detection. These capabilities may augment current diagnostic processes and improve the approach to the management of skin cancer. To explain this technology, we discuss fundamental terminology, potential benefits, and limitations of AI, and commercial applications relevant to dermatologists. A clear understanding of the technology may help to reduce physician concerns about AI and promote its use in the clinical setting. Ultimately, the development and validation of AI technologies, their approval by regulatory agencies, and widespread adoption by dermatologists and other clinicians may enhance patient care. Technology-augmented detection of skin cancer has the potential to improve quality of life, reduce health care costs by reducing unnecessary procedures, and promote greater access to high-quality skin assessment. Dermatologists play a critical role in the responsible development and deployment of AI capabilities applied to skin cancer.

TI THE TIME-TRAVELING LAWYER: USING TIME TRAVEL STORIES AND SCIENCE FICTION
   IN LEGAL EDUCATION
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF AMERICAN LEGAL STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
DE Law and Literature; Law and Science Fiction; Law and Time Travel;
   Artificial Intelligence; Emotional Intelligence and the Law
AB Science fiction and time travel can be used to inform and enhance the education of law students in profound ways. Within the broader field of law and literature, the relationship between law and science fiction, especially time travel stories, is rich and useful. Themes and concepts in time travel can be applied in the exploration of existing legal philosophies as well as a more expansive and engaging study of power, authority, freedom, and a number of global issues. As governments and people worldwide wrestle with climate change, armed conflict, pandemics, and the increasing significance of artificial intelligence and other advances in technology, time travel stories give students unique contexts in which to consider what law is and the degree to which it defines human experience. For generations, brilliant science fiction writers have offered thought-provoking stories and worlds that law professors and their students can use to reimagine legal thought and practice. Like its close relatives, mythology and fantasy, the science fiction genre is untethered to current social or political experience or projections necessarily corrupted by narrowly conceived historical perspectives. Science fiction writers are interested in illuminating possibilities by considering identifiable problems in unidentifiable environments. It is no accident that gender identity, racism, reproductive rights, extremist ideologies, global health crises, and various recognizable forms of labor exploitation are addressed in provocative and insightful ways by a number of the best science fiction writers. Law has a strong presence in their work. Judges, law givers, ruling groups, and other less familiar forms of power and control appear in these stories and help to move and shape the experience of the time traveler. Law students can draw on the work of these writers to consider old questions in new and refreshingly broad ways. The importance of communication and access to information are also strong themes common to law and science fiction. How are concepts of truth and propaganda significant to power? Is truth necessary for legitimacy? Information technologies introduced in the science fiction world now exist in real time in forms and with speed and volume unimagined even a few decades ago. As artificial intelligence becomes dominant in many aspects of our daily lives, law students must consider how it may change law making, court procedures, entire legal systems, and perhaps even concepts of justice. As a project, law students might develop a case and conduct a trial using an AI judge or try a case to an AI jury. How human is the law? The role of emotional intelligence and concepts like mercy, restorative justice, forgiveness, or retribution are also things they might explore in seminars or other classes using science fiction literature and other time travel media as a framework.

AB As the first step in image interpretation is detection, an error in perception can prematurely end the diagnostic process leading to missed diagnoses. Because perceptual errors of this sort-"failure to detect"-are the most common interpretive error (and cause of litigation) in radiology, understanding the nature of perceptual expertise is essential in decreasing radiology's long-standing error rates. In this article, we review what constitutes a perceptual error, the existing models of radiologic image perception, the development of perceptual expertise and how it can be tested, perceptual learning methods in training radiologists, and why understanding perceptual expertise is still relevant in the era of artificial intelligence. Adding targeted interventions, such as perceptual learning, to existing teaching practices, has the potential to enhance expertise and reduce medical error.

AB Objective The primary objective of this study is to investigate various applications of artificial intelligence (AI) and statistical methodologies for analyzing and managing peritoneal metastases (PM) caused by gastrointestinal cancers.Methods Relevant keywords and search criteria were comprehensively researched on PubMed and Google Scholar to identify articles and reviews related to the topic. The AI approaches considered were conventional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, and the relevant statistical approaches included biostatistics and logistic models.Results The systematic literature review yielded nearly 30 articles meeting the predefined criteria. Analyses of these studies showed that AI methodologies consistently outperformed traditional statistical approaches. In the AI approaches, DL consistently produced the most precise results, while classical ML demonstrated varied performance but maintained high predictive accuracy. The sample size was the recurring factor that increased the accuracy of the predictions for models of the same type.Conclusions AI and statistical approaches can detect PM developing among patients with gastrointestinal cancers. Therefore, if clinicians integrated these approaches into diagnostics and prognostics, they could better analyze and manage PM, enhancing clinical decision-making and patients' outcomes. Collaboration across multiple institutions would also help in standardizing methods for data collection and allowing consistent results.

AB Amid mounting interest in artificial intelligence (AI) technology, communication scholars have sought to understand humans' perceptions of and attitudes toward AI's predictions, recommendations, and decisions. Meanwhile, scholars in the nascent but growing field of explainable AI (XAI) have aimed to clarify AI's operational mechanisms and make them interpretable, visible, and transparent. In this conceptual article, we suggest that a conversation between human-machine communication (HMC) and XAI is advantageous and necessary. Following the introduction of these two areas, we demonstrate how research on XAI can inform the HMC scholarship regarding the human-in-the-loop approach and the message production explainability. Next, we expound upon how communication scholars' focuses on message sources, receivers, features, and effects can reciprocally benefit XAI research. At its core, this article proposes a two-level HMC framework and posits that bridging the two fields can guide future AI research and development.

AB Despite a growing body of research on AI adoption and use, the impact of various psychological and technological factors on users' decision-making processes remains largely understudied. To bridge this gap, this study examines the combined influence of self-efficacy, AI ethics, and technological factors on users' attitudes toward the use of AI technologies. Using an integrated theoretical model that combines self-efficacy theory and the technology acceptance model, this study conducted a nationwide survey in the U.S. (N = 1252) to test the multistage process of determining users' attitudes toward the use of AI technologies. The results showed that perceived AI ethics plays a vital role in mediating between self-efficacy and technological factors, leading to a more positive attitude toward AI technologies. This study contributes to the AI adoption literature by advancing an integrated model to unveil the underlying mechanisms influencing users' attitudes toward AI. Theoretical and practical implications are further discussed.

AB As social robots begin to assume various social roles in society, the demand for understanding how social robots work and communicate grows rapidly. While literature on explainable artificial intelligence suggests that transparency about a social robot's working mechanism can evoke users' positive attitudes, transparency may also have negative outcomes. This study investigates the paradoxical effects of the transparency of facial recognition technology and speech recognition technology in human-robot interactions. Based on a lab experiment and combined analyses of users' quantitative and qualitative responses, this study suggests that the transparency of facial recognition technology in human-robot interaction increases users' social presence, reduces privacy concerns, and enhances users' acceptance of robots. However, exposure to both facial and speech recognition technologies revives users' privacy worries. This study further parses users' open-ended evaluation of the prospective application of social robots' tracking technologies and discusses the theoretical, practical, and ethical value of the findings.

AB This research revisits the communication mediation model to understand when citizens support AI policies. Using data from a national online survey (N = 1252), our research delineates the mechanism by which AI-related news consumption enhances AI literacy through AI-related discussions, subsequently fostering enhanced support for AI policies and regulations. In this process, AI efficacy emerges as a critical boundary condition. Specifically, the relationship between AI-related news consumption and support for AI policy and regulation via AI discussions and literacy varies contingent on levels of AI efficacy. The findings highlight a moderated indirect effect, whereby the positive influence from AI-related news consumption to support for AI policy and regulation through AI discussions and AI literacy only occurs when citizens have high levels of AI efficacy. This research offers a deeper understanding of the factors encouraging citizen engagement in AI policy and regulation activities and provides valuable insights for AI literacy and education from theoretical, practical, and policy perspectives.

AB Background: Frailty assessment is imperative for tailoring healthcare interventions for older adults, but its implementation remains challenging due to the effort and time needed. The advances of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) present a novel opportunity to harness real-world data (RWD) including electronic health records, administrative claims, and other routinely collected medical records for frailty assessments. Methods: We followed the PRISMA-ScR guideline and searched Embase, Web of Science, and PubMed databases for articles that predict frailty using AI through RWD from inception until October 2023. We synthesized and analyzed the selected publications according to their field of application, methodologies employed, validation processes, outcomes achieved, and their respective limitations and strengths. Results: A total of 23 publications were selected from the initial search (N=2067) and bibliography. The approaches to frailty prediction using RWD and AI were categorized into two groups based on the type of data utilized: 1) AI models using structured data and 2) NLP techniques applied to unstructured clinical notes. We found that AI models achieved moderate to high predictive performance in predicting frailty. However, to demonstrate their clinical utility, these models require further validation using external data and a comprehensive assessment of their impact on patients' health outcomes. Additionally, the application of NLP in frailty prediction is still in its early stages. Great potential exists to enhance frailty prediction by integrating structured data and clinical notes. Conclusion: The combination of AI and RWD presents significant opportunities for advancing frailty assessment. To maximize the advantages of these technological advances, future research is needed to rigorously address the challenges associated with the validation of AI models and innovative data integration.

AB Access to behavior analytic services is limited and often unavailable for many in areas with a dearth of qualified providers. Tools to support behavior-change agents located in the natural environment of consumers may be a way to provide behavioral interventions. An artificial intelligence (AI) platform that guides the implementation of behavioral interventions may be useful for supporting procedural fidelity. The current studies evaluated whether an AI platform was effective at increasing and maintaining high levels of procedural fidelity in individuals with little to no prior training. Participants were two behavior technicians in training (Exp. 1) and three caregivers (Exp. 2). Introducing guidance provided by the AI platform GAINS improved the procedural fidelity with which behavior technicians and caregivers implemented behavioral interventions with children with autism, except for one caregiver. These results suggest AI platforms may be useful tools for supporting high levels of procedural fidelity by novice users.

We also would like to demonstrate the different application and principal mechanisms of big data in the latest technologies known as blockchain and artificial intelligence, recognizing their benefits and limitations. Perhaps, medical education and digital anatomy are unexplored fields that might be profitable to investigate as we are proposing. The healthcare system can be revolutionized using these different technologies. Thus, we are explaining the basis of these systems focused to the medical arena in order to encourage medical doctors, nurses, biotechnologies and other healthcare professions to be involved and create a more efficient and efficacy system.

AB People now commonly interact with Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents. How do these interactions shape how humans perceive each other? In two preregistered studies (total N = 1,261), we show that people evaluate other humans more harshly after interacting with an AI (compared with an unrelated purported human). In Study 1, participants who worked on a creative task with AIs (versus purported humans) subsequently rated another purported human's work more negatively. Study 2 replicated this effect and demonstrated that the results hold even when participants believed their evaluation would not be shared with the purported human. Exploratory analyses of participants' conversations show that prior to their human evaluations they were more demanding, more instrumental and displayed less positive affect towards AIs (versus purported humans). These findings point to a potentially worrisome side effect of the exponential rise in human-AI interactions.

AB The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in dermatology holds promise for enhancing clinical accuracy, enabling earlier detection of skin malignancies, suggesting potential management of skin lesions and eruptions, and promoting improved continuity of care. AI implementation in dermatology, however, raises several ethical concerns. This review explores the current benefits and challenges associated with AI integration, underscoring ethical considerations related to autonomy, informed consent, and privacy. We also examine the ways in which beneficence, nonmaleficence, and distributive justice may be impacted. Clarifying the role of AI, striking a balance between security and transparency, fostering open dialogue with our patients, collaborating with developers of AI, implementing educational initiatives for dermatologists and their patients, and participating in the establishment of regulatory guidelines are essential to navigating ethical and responsible AI incorporation into dermatology.

AB Theories of decision making are implemented in models that predict and explain behavior in terms of latent cognitive processes. But where do these models come from, and how are they instantiated in the brain? In this article, we examine several avenues where artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) can benefit decision theory by providing new methods for developing and testing cognitive models. First, machine learning can be used to efficiently estimate the values of latent parameters in cognitive models and assign posterior probabilities to competing models of the same observed data. Second, models of decision behavior can be embedded within artificially intelligent systems to allow them to make inferences about human counterparts (goals, abilities, cognition) in real time, equipping AI with tools to interact socially. Third, AI can be used to understand how evolutionary and learning processes give rise to the cognitive abilities that support decision making. Last, the tools of experimental psychology and decision sciences can be applied to better understand the "black boxes" of neural networks by systematically testing input-output (stimulus-response) relationships. Put together, we suggest that merging ML/AI into decision-modeling-and vice versa-is a promising path toward many long-term benefits for both fields.

AB The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been actively promoting the use of real-world data (RWD) in drug development. RWD can generate important real-world evidence reflecting the real-world clinical environment where the treatments are used. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI), especially machine- and deep-learning (ML/DL) methods, have been increasingly used across many stages of the drug development process. Advancements in AI have also provided new strategies to analyze large, multidimensional RWD. Thus, we conducted a rapid review of articles from the past 20 years, to provide an overview of the drug development studies that use both AI and RWD. We found that the most popular applications were adverse event detection, trial recruitment, and drug repurposing. Here, we also discuss current research gaps and future opportunities.

AB Objectives: This scoping review aimed to summarize the available literature on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in pharmacy education and identify gaps where additional research is needed. Findings: Seven studies specifically addressing the use of AI in pharmacy education were identified. Of these 7 studies, 5 focused on AI use in the context of teaching and learning, 1 on the prediction of academic performance for admissions, and the final study focused on using AI text generation to elucidate the benefits and limitations of ChatGPT use in pharmacy education. Summary: There are currently a limited number of available publications that describe AI use in pharmacy education. Several challenges exist regarding the use of AI in pharmacy education, including the need for faculty expertise and time, limited generalizability of tools, limited outcomes data, and several legal and ethical concerns. As AI use increases and implementation becomes more standardized, opportunities will be created for the inclusion of AI in pharmacy education.

AB IntroductionArtificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform oncologic care. There have been significant developments in AI applications in medical imaging and increasing interest in multimodal models. These are likely to enable improved oncologic care through more precise diagnosis, increasingly in a more personalized and less invasive manner. In this review, we provide an overview of the current state and challenges that clinicians, administrative personnel and policy makers need to be aware of and mitigate for the technology to reach its full potential.Areas coveredThe article provides a brief targeted overview of AI, a high-level review of the current state and future potential AI applications in diagnostic radiology and to a lesser extent digital pathology, focusing on oncologic applications. This is followed by a discussion of emerging approaches, including multimodal models. The article concludes with a discussion of technical, regulatory challenges and infrastructure needs for AI to realize its full potential.Expert opinionThere is a large volume of promising research, and steadily increasing commercially available tools using AI. For the most advanced and promising precision diagnostic applications of AI to be used clinically, robust and comprehensive quality monitoring systems and informatics platforms will likely be required.

AB The neural network approach has proven useful for the development of artificial intelligence systems. However, a disadvantage with this approach is that the knowledge embedded in the neural network is opaque. In this paper, we show how to interpret neural network knowledge in symbolic form. We lay down required definitions for this treatment, formulate the interpretation algorithm, and formally verify its soundness. The main result is a formalized relationship between a neural network and a rule-based system. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the neural network generates rules of better performance than the decision tree approach in noisy conditions.

AB There is a steadily increasing number of artificial intelligence (AI) tools available and cleared for use in clinical radiological practice. Radiologists will increasingly be faced with options provided by other radiologist colleagues, clinician colleagues, vendors, or other professionals for obtaining and deploying AI algorithms in clinical practice. It is important that radiologists are familiar with basic and practical aspects that need to be considered when assessing an AI tool for use in their practice, so that resources are properly allocated and there is an appropriate return on investment through enhancements in patient quality of care, safety, and/or process efficiency.

ID COMMUNICATING RISK
AB Objectives: To highlight the often overlooked role of user interface (UI) design in mitigating bias in artificial intelligence (AI)-based clinical decision support (CDS). Materials and Methods: This perspective paper discusses the interdependency between AI-based algorithm development and UI design and proposes strategies for increasing the safety and efficacy of CDS. Results: The role of design in biasing user behavior is well documented in behavioral economics and other disciplines. We offer an example of how UI designs play a role in how bias manifests in our machine learning-based CDS development. Discussion: Much discussion on bias in AI revolves around data quality and algorithm design; less attention is given to how UI design can exacerbate or mitigate limitations of AI-based applications. Conclusion: This work highlights important considerations including the role of UI design in reinforcing/mitigating bias, human factors methods for identifying issues before an application is released, and risk communication strategies.

AB This study employs a systematic literature review (PRISMA methodology) to investigate the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in walkability assessments conducted between 2012 and 2022. Analyzing 34 articles exploring data types, factors, and AI tools, the review emphasizes the value of utilizing diverse datasets, particularly street view images, to train supersized AI models. This approach fosters efficient, unbiased assessments and offers deep insights into pedestrian environment interactions. Furthermore, AI tools empower walkability assessment by facilitating mapping, scoring, designing pedestrian routes, and uncovering previously unconsidered factors. The current shift from large-scale spatial data analysis (allocentric perspective) to a ground-level view (egocentric perspective) and physical and perceptual features of walking introduces a subjective lens into current walkability assessment tools. However, the efficacy of current methods in addressing non-visual aspects of human perception and their applicability across diverse demographics remains debatable. Finally, the lack of integration of emerging technologies like virtual/augmented reality and digital twin leaves a significant gap in research, inviting further study to determine their efficacy in enhancing the current methods and, in general, understanding the interaction of humans and cities.

AB This qualitative study explores the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and internal communication, investigating AI applications, challenges, and best practices. In-depth interviews with 20 senior communication professionals examined perceptions of AI's impact on internal communication processes and outcomes. Key findings indicate AI improves internal communication efficiency, information flow, listening capability, and employee experience. However, challenges include lack of AI knowledge among employees, fears about job security andbias, and concerns about authenticity loss. To enable effective AI adoption for internal communication, organizations need education and training, a "co-piloting" approach between humans and machines, transparent communication, ethical governance, and an open culture of experimentation. This research makes important theoretical contributions by illuminating AI's transformative potential for internal communication. It also offers practical insights to guide organizations in strategically leveraging AI to elevate internal communication.

AB As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more seamlessly integrated into our social life, the unfair outcomes and ethical issues associated with AI and its subtechnologies have been widely discussed in scholarly work across disciplines in recent years. This study provides an overview of the conceptualization, empirical scholarship, and ethical concerns related to algorithmic bias across diverse disciplines. In doing so, the study relies on the framework of AI-mediated communication and human-AI communication, as well as topic modeling and semantic network analysis to examine the conceptualization and major thematic areas of AI bias literature. The study reveals the complexity of the concept of algorithmic bias, which extends beyond the algorithm itself. Empirical scholarship on AI and algorithmic bias revolves around conceptualizations, human perceptions, algorithm optimization, practical applications, and ethics and policy implications. Understanding and addressing the ethical challenges require a multilevel examination from the perspectives of different stakeholders. Theoretical and practical implications are further discussed in the context of AI and algorithmic justice.

AB The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of artificial intelligence tools for the prediction of Salmonella presence and absence in agricultural surface waters based on the population of microbiological indicators (total coliform, generic Escherichia coli, and enterococci) and physicochemical attributes of water (air and water temperature, conductivity, ORP, pH, and turbidity). Previously collected data set from six agricultural ponds monitored for two growing seasons were used for analysis. Classification algorithms including artificial neural networks (ANNs), the nearest neighborhood algorithm (kNN), and support vector machines (SVM) were trained and tested with a 539-point data set for optimum prediction accuracy. Classification accuracy performances were validated with data set (400 samples) collected from different agricultural surface water sources. All tested algorithms yielded the highest accuracy around 75 +/- 1% for generic E. coli followed by enterococci (65 +/- 5%) and total coliform (60 +/- 10%). Classifiers calculated 6-15% higher accuracy ranging from 62 to 66% for turbidity than all other tested physicochemical attributes. Based on E. coli populations measured in other water sources, trained algorithms predicted the presence and absence of Salmonella with an accuracy between 58.15 and 59.23%. The classification performance of ANN, kNN, and SVM algorithms are encouraging for the prediction of Salmonella in agricultural surface waters.

AB Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the abil-ity of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform reasoning tasks commonly associated with intel-ligent beings. Powered by novel and affordable software and hardware capabilities, AI is finding its way into dairy farms. The purpose of this review is to give examples of re-search on AI for dairy farms and highlight some emerging opportunities. Many AI applications are based on machine learning, including the technique of deep learning. Sources: We used literature sources and our own expe-riences with AI applications in dairy farms. Synthesis: We found that machine-learning methods enable applications such as real-time analysis of video images to identify cattle, measure body condition and temperature, and detect changes in feed topography to measure feed availability and intake. Changes in behavior can be detected as early warning alerts for disease such as lameness or as an indication of estrus. Such AI ap-plications can mimic human reasoning and enhance hu-man tasks. Machine-learning methods may also be able to use heterogeneous data sets to predict future performance such as fertility. For example, predictions of conception rates may be improved by combining health events, chang-es in body energy reserves, genetic data, behavioral data, milk analyses, and environmental information. Perhaps AI methods could be used to monitor compliance of execution of protocols in dairy farms and inform training. Conclusions and Applications: Artificial intelli-gence, made possible with advances in hardware and soft-ware, will make intelligent use of new big data a reality and will change the dairy sector by enabling improved work environments and removing or minimizing the need for manual human processing of repetitive tasks. A hurdle for development and application of some AI is the problem that various dairy data often exist in silos that are not connected.

AB Traffic measurement is the bedrock of the next-generation network systems. While it plays a crucial role in bringing fundamental data and support to core network functions, it also confronts the challenge of meeting the diverse demands of new network traffic characteristics and emerging applications. The network-wide measurement has received more and more attention. Given that big network data is distributed in nature, it is essential to aggregate the views of multiple measurement points to build a network-wide perception of traffic. Another latest trend involves artificial intelligence technologies that allow seamless aggregation of multifaceted network traffic data to advance traffic data analysis and support related applications. Nonetheless, a gap remains in existing methodologies, which often fail to fully address the diverse demands of network traffic measurement in this evolving landscape.

AB The design of enzyme catalytic stability is of great significance in medicine and industry. However, traditional methods are time-consuming and costly. Hence, a growing number of complementary computational tools have been developed, e.g. ESMFold, AlphaFold2, Rosetta, RosettaFold, FireProt, ProteinMPNN. They are proposed for algorithm-driven and data-driven enzyme design through artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms including natural language processing, machine learning, deep learning, variational autoencoder/generative adversarial network, message passing neural network (MPNN). In addition, the challenges of design of enzyme catalytic stability include insufficient structured data, large sequence search space, inaccurate quantitative prediction, low efficiency in experimental validation and a cumbersome design process. The first principle of the enzyme catalytic stability design is to treat amino acids as the basic element. By designing the sequence of an enzyme, the flexibility and stability of the structure are adjusted, thus controlling the catalytic stability of the enzyme in a specific industrial environment or in an organism. Common indicators of design goals include the change in denaturation energy (Delta Delta G), melting temperature (Delta Tm), optimal temperature (Topt), optimal pH (pHopt), etc. In this review, we summarized and evaluated the enzyme design in catalytic stability by AI in terms of mechanism, strategy, data, labeling, coding, prediction, testing, unit, integration and prospect.

AB This review focuses on the critical role of potassium (K) in potato cultivation, addressing its essential functions in plant metabolism and the challenges in managing soil K levels, specifically under sandy soils. The K use efficiency is higher in potatoes, with the maximum potential up to 55%, compared to cereals at 19%. Potatoes require high quantities of K, especially in well-drained sandy soils, to maximise growth and yield. Because K is a highly leaching-prone nutrient in these soils, its deficiencies could affect plant health, metabolism (K is required to activate more than 60 enzymes) and productivity. Optimal potato growth necessitates maintaining 1.8% K in the tubers, corresponding to a need of 0.22 kg K2O ac-1 for a substantial yield. The review article highlights the significant use of potash fertilisers in the United States, with an average consumption of 4.43 million metric tons between 2010 and 2021, underscoring the importance of K in agricultural practices. The paper also highlights the difference in K requirement and removal among different potato varieties that require the maximum amount in processing types. This manuscript discusses K's management schemes through soil testing, plant tissue analysis and artificial intelligence. The integration of various machine-learning methods could offer promising prospects for predicting K response in potatoes, aiming to improve nutrient management and sustainable crop production. By synthesising current knowledge and advancements in K fertilisation techniques, this paper provides insights into overcoming the challenges of K management in potato cultivation, ultimately contributing to increased productivity and improved crop quality.

AB Background: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in psychiatry presents opportunities for enhancing patient care but raises significant ethical concerns and challenges in clinical application. Addressing these challenges necessitates an informed and ethically aware psychiatric workforce capable of integrating AI into practice responsibly. Methods: A mixed-methods study was conducted to assess the outcomes of the "CONNECT with AI" - (Collaborative Opportunity to Navigate and Negotiate Ethical Challenges and Trials with Artificial Intelligence) workshop, aimed at exploring AI's ethical implications and applications in psychiatry. This workshop featured presentations, discussions, and scenario analyses focusing on AI's role in mental health care. Pre- and postworkshop questionnaires and focus group discussions evaluated participants' perspectives, and ethical understanding regarding AI in psychiatry. Results: Participants exhibited a cautious optimism towards AI, recognizing its potential to augment mental health care while expressing concerns over ethical usage, patient-doctor relationships, and AI's practical application in patient care. The workshop significantly improved participants' ethical understanding, highlighting a substantial knowledge gap and the need for further education in AI among psychiatrists. Conclusion: The study underscores the necessity of continuous education and ethical guideline development for psychiatrists in the era of AI, emphasizing collaborative efforts in AI system design to ensure they meet clinical needs ethically and effectively. Future initiatives should aim to broaden psychiatrists' exposure to AI, fostering a deeper understanding and integration of AI technologies in psychiatric practice.

AB Over the last decades, significant strides were made in understanding the biochemical factors influencing the nutritional content and flavor profile of fruits and vegetables. Product differentiation in the produce aisle is the natural consequence of increasing consumer power in the food industry. Cotton-candy grapes, specialty tomatoes, and pineapple-flavored white strawberries provide a few examples. Given the increased demand for flavorful varieties, and pressing need to reduce micronutrient malnutrition, we expect breeding to increase its prioritization toward these traits. Reaching this goal will, in part, necessitate knowledge of the genetic architecture controlling these traits, as well as the development of breeding methods that maximize their genetic gain. Can artificial intelligence (AI) help predict flavor preferences, and can such insights be leveraged by breeding programs?

AB Scenario planning is a powerful tool for cities to navigate uncertainties and mitigate the impacts of adverse scenarios by projecting future outcomes based on present-day decisions. This approach is becoming increasingly important given the growing call for building resilient cities to face adverse future scenarios posed by emerging disruptive technologies and climate change. However, conventional scenario planning practices predominantly rely on expert knowledge and judgment, which may be limited in accounting for the complexity of future scenarios. Therefore, we explored the potential integration of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to assist scenario planning practices. We synthesized related studies from various disciplines (e.g., engineering, computer science, and urban planning) to identify the potential applications of AI in the three key components of scenario planning: plan generation, scenario generation, and plan evaluation. We then discuss the challenges and possible solutions for integrating AI into the scenario planning process and highlight the critical role of planning experts in this process. We conclude by outlining future research opportunities in this context. Ultimately, this study contributes to the advancement of scenario planning practices and aids the creation of more resilient cities that can thrive in an uncertain future. (c) 2024 THE AUTHORS.

AB There are many impactful applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in the electronic radiology roundtrip and the patient's journey through the healthcare system that go beyond diagnostic applications. These tools have the potential to improve quality and safety, optimize workflow, increase efficiency, and increase patient satisfaction. In this article, we review the role of AI for process improvement and workflow enhancement which includes applications beginning from the time of order entry, scan acquisition, applications supporting the image interpretation task, and applications supporting tasks after image interpretation such as result communication. These non-diagnostic workflow and process optimization tasks are an important part of the arsenal of potential AI tools that can streamline day to day clinical practice and patient care.Semin Roentgenology 58:158-169 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Electromyography (EMG) is an integral part of many biomedical and healthcare applications. It has been used as a metric for tracking rehabilitation progress and identifying diseases that affect muscle activation patterns. Although it is widely used in many disciplines, conventional EMG recording and interpretation techniques lack in providing precise signal detection and robust classification accuracy. In recent years, thanks to advances in both material science and artificial intelligence, EMG detection techniques are improving at a rapid pace. Materials that allow for enhanced biocompatibility have improved the quality of data recorded by electrodes. The use of machine learning algorithms has paved new ways to understand complex EMG signals, triggering diverse, novel, and improved application scenarios within the healthcare framework. To help readers establish a clear picture of the two most important components in EMG technology, i.e., electrodes and algorithms, while catching up with the latest research outcomes, this review article is composed. The article starts by introducing conventional EMG electrode materials and architectures, then explains how state-of-the-art works have improved electrode utilization. Subsequently, EMG signal conditioning and interpretation algorithms are investigated. Finally, current challenges in the research domain and authors' perspectives are discussed.

AB Using artificial intelligence (AI) models, cost effective electricity meter, and easily accessible weather data, this paper discusses a methodology for improved prediction of hourly residential space heating electricity use. Four AI models [back propagation neural network (BPNN), radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), general regression neural network (GRNN), and support vector regression (SVR)] were used for predicting hourly residential heating electricity use. For this study, a typical single-family house was used to obtain the data used for AI prediction models. Results showed SVR's ability to predict hourly residential heating electricity use was better when compared with other AI models. Furthermore, through comparison of prediction performance in different time periods, additional investigation was conducted to evaluate the effect of dynamic human behaviors on the prediction accuracy of the AI models. Results revealed that dynamic human behaviors have a negative effect on the prediction performance.

AB Background: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care has grown exponentially with the promise of facilitating biomedical research and enhancing diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, disease prevention, and health care delivery. We aim to examine the current state, limitations, and future directions of AI in thyroidology.Summary: AI has been explored in thyroidology since the 1990s, and currently, there is an increasing interest in applying AI to improve the care of patients with thyroid nodules (TNODs), thyroid cancer, and functional or autoimmune thyroid disease. These applications aim to automate processes, improve the accuracy and consistency of diagnosis, personalize treatment, decrease the burden for health care professionals, improve access to specialized care in areas lacking expertise, deepen the understanding of subtle pathophysiologic patterns, and accelerate the learning curve of less experienced clinicians. There are promising results for many of these applications. Yet, most are in the validation or early clinical evaluation stages. Only a few are currently adopted for risk stratification of TNODs by ultrasound and determination of the malignant nature of indeterminate TNODs by molecular testing. Challenges of the currently available AI applications include the lack of prospective and multicenter validations and utility studies, small and low diversity of training data sets, differences in data sources, lack of explainability, unclear clinical impact, inadequate stakeholder engagement, and inability to use outside of the research setting, which might limit the value of their future adoption.Conclusions: AI has the potential to improve many aspects of thyroidology; however, addressing the limitations affecting the suitability of AI interventions in thyroidology is a prerequisite to ensure that AI provides added value for patients with thyroid disease.

AB Given that artificial intelligence and machine learning is now a reality of modern existence, rapidly being applied to medicine, and especially radiology, we submit a new educational perspective. By codifying technology education during the diagnostic radiology internship, we believe it is not only possible but necessary, to reframe the identity of diagnostic radiology. This paper describes the restructuring of the radiology clinical internship, limiting clinical rotations to high-yield essentials, thereby allowing for the introduction of data and technology science, and comprehensive medical physics training. By linking modality-immersion based training with the physics of each technology, we postulate a more thorough understanding and, ultimately, the mastery of current and future technological innovations. Concurrently we advocate for the study of artificial intelligence and machine learning in order to understand how radiologists can apply this technology to help patients on the precision and population health levels. This training would allow interns to spend the majority of their time under the umbrella of a radiology department, in lieu of multiple rotations on an assortment of clinical services. An in-depth technology and physics exam at the end of the internship would be a natural transition to the start of the R1 year, allowing for the application of this newly attained knowledge throughout their residency. Diagnostic radiologists have led medicine into the digital era, and now we should lead the medical community into this transformational era as the "Data-Driven Physician" of the 21st century.

AB Despite a substantial body of scholarship at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and journalism, it remains relatively unexplored as to how AI-generated news is different from news produced by professional journalists in terms of news bias. To fill the gap, this study compares human versus GPT-2-generated news in terms of the linguistic features, tone, and bias toward gender and race/ethnicity on two highly controversial issues, namely abortion and immigration, using news transcripts from CNN and Fox News. In doing so, the study adopts a mixed-method content analysis approach, including dictionary and coreference analysis, topic modeling and semantic network analysis, and manual content analysis. The results reveal that although AI news differs from human news in terms of language features and thematic areas, machine news is not necessarily more biased compared to human news regarding gender and race/ethnicity. Implications are discussed for future scholarship on algorithmic bias in lieu of the roles that AI-generated news may play in journalism and democracy.

AB PurposeDrawing on the personalization-privacy paradox and guided by means-end analysis, this study explores how consumers balance their concerns for privacy and the benefits of smart home device personalization and the role that trust plays in the process. More specifically, this study aims to investigate how perceptions of smart device personalization and privacy concerns are shaped by consumers' experiences and the role of trust in the deliberation process.Design/methodology/approachIn-depth interviews were conducted across diverse demographic groups of smart device users to shed light on the balancing act between personalization and privacy.FindingsThe study found that product experience, ownership type, perceived value of convenience and control and quality of life via "smart things" are key motivators for product usage. The benefits of tailored recommendations and high relevance are balanced against the risks of echo chamber effects and loss of control. The results also show the role of active involvement in the privacy calculus and trust level. The study points to the significance of an ecosystem-based service/business model in gaining consumer confidence when they balance between personalization and privacy.Originality/valueAlthough many studies have explored trust, privacy concerns and personalization in an artificial intelligence (AI)-related context, few have addressed trust in the context of both smart devices and the personalization-privacy paradox. As such, this study adds to the existing literature by incorporating the concept of trust and addressing both privacy concerns and personalization in the AI context.

ID CLASSIFICATION; PROSTATE
AB Diagnostic pathology is the foundation and gold standard for identifying carcinomas. However, high inter-observer variability substantially affects productivity in routine pathology and is especially ubiquitous in diagnostician-deficient medical centres. Despite rapid growth in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), the application of whole-slide pathology diagnosis remains impractical. Here, we present a novel pathology whole-slide diagnosis method, powered by artificial intelligence, to address the lack of interpretable diagnosis. The proposed method masters the ability to automate the human-like diagnostic reasoning process and translate gigapixels directly to a series of interpretable predictions, providing second opinions and thereby encouraging consensus in clinics. Moreover, using 913 collected examples of whole-slide data representing patients with bladder cancer, we show that our method matches the performance of 17 pathologists in the diagnosis of urothelial carcinoma. We believe that our method provides an innovative and reliable means for making diagnostic suggestions and can be deployed at low cost as next-generation, artificial intelligence-enhanced CAD technology for use in diagnostic pathology.
   Diagnostic pathology currently requires substantial human expertise, often with high inter-observer variability. A whole-slide pathology method automates the prediction process and provides computer-aided diagnosis using artificial intelligence.

AB In strawberry cultivation, precise disease management is crucial for maximizing yields and reducing unnecessary fungicide use. Traditional methods for measuring leaf wetness duration (LWD), a critical factor in assessing the risk of fungal diseases such as botrytis fruit rot and anthracnose, have been reliant on sensors with known limitations in accuracy and reliability and difficulties with calibrating. To overcome these limitations, this study introduced an innovative algorithm for leaf wetness detection systems employing high-resolution imaging and deep learning technologies, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Implemented at the University of Florida's Plant Science Research and Education Unit (PSREU) in Citra, FL, USA, and expanded to three additional locations across Florida, USA, the system captured and analyzed images of a reference plate to accurately determine the wetness and, consequently, the LWD. The comparison of system outputs with manual observations across diverse environmental conditions demonstrated the enhanced accuracy and reliability of the artificial intelligence-driven approach. By integrating this system into the Strawberry Advisory System (SAS), this study provided an efficient solution to improve disease risk assessment and fungicide application strategies, promising significant economic benefits and sustainability advances in strawberry production.

AB This study examines the obstacles to the effectiveness of fact-checking, focusing primarily on the pervasive impact of entrenched biases. Fact-checking efforts often face resistance when linked to mistrusted sources, leading to cognitive dissonance and the rejection of messages in favor of pre-existing beliefs, a phenomenon known as motivated reasoning. This resistance hinders organizations' ability to correct misconceptions surrounding social issues and entities. The research delves into whether non-human entities such as AI can facilitate less biased information processing due to their perceived impartiality. Applying a moderated mediation model in experimental settings, we found that labeling a source as artificial intelligence is pivotal in evaluating factchecking. AI labels moderate the impact of partisan biases on the persuasive outcomes of fact-checks, such as message credibility and acceptance, compared to the human source. This study offers valuable insights for enhancing the effectiveness of fact-checking in the context of cognitive and psychological biases by highlighting the critical influence of information sources in reducing polarization in public perceptions of scientific issues.

ID DURATION; ANTHRACNOSE
AB The Strawberry Advisory System (SAS) is a tool developed to help Florida strawberry growers determine the risk of common fungal diseases and the need for fungicide applications. Leaf wetness duration (LWD) is one of the important parameters in SAS disease risk modeling. By accurately measuring the LWD, disease risk can be better assessed, leading to less fungicide use and more economic benefits to the farmers. This research aimed to develop and test a more accurate leaf wetness detection system than traditional leaf wetness sensors. In this research, a leaf wetness detection system was developed and tested using color imaging of a reference surface and a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is one of the artificial-intelligence-based learning methods. The system was placed at two separate field locations during the 2021-2022 strawberry-growing season. The results from the developed system were compared against manual observation to determine the accuracy of the system. It was found that the AI- and imaging-based system had high accuracy in detecting wetness on a reference surface. The developed system can be used in SAS for determining accurate disease risks and fungicide recommendations for strawberry production and allows the expansion of the system to multiple locations.

AB Background: Low delivery efficiency of nanoparticles (NPs) to the tumor is a critical barrier in the field of cancer nanomedicine. Strategies on how to improve NP tumor delivery efficiency remain to be determined.
   Methods: This study analyzed the roles of NP physicochemical properties, tumor models, and cancer types in NP tumor delivery efficiency using multiple machine learning and artificial intelligence methods, using data from a recently published Nano-Tumor Database that contains 376 datasets generated from a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model.
   Results: The deep neural network model adequately predicted the delivery efficiency of different NPs to different tumors and it outperformed all other machine learning methods; including random forest, support vector machine, linear regression, and bagged model methods. The adjusted determination coefficients (R-2) in the full training dataset were 0.92, 0.77, 0.77 and 0.76 for the maximum delivery efficiency (DEmax), delivery efficiency at 24 h (DE24), at 168 h (DE168), and at the last sampling time (DETlast). The corresponding R-2 values in the test dataset were 0.70, 0.46, 0.33 and 0.63, respectively. Also, this study showed that cancer type was an important determinant for the deep neural network model in predicting the tumor delivery efficiency across all endpoints (19-29%). Among all physicochemical properties, the Zeta potential and core material played a greater role than other properties, such as the type, shape, and targeting strategy.
   Conclusion: This study provides a quantitative model to improve the design of cancer nanomedicine with greater tumor delivery efficiency. These results help to improve our understanding of the causes of low NP tumor delivery efficiency. This study demonstrates the feasibility of integrating artificial intelligence with PBPK modeling approaches to study cancer nanomedicine.

AB A sea change is happening in finance. Machines appear to be on the rise and humans on the decline. Human endeavors have become unmanned endeavors. Human thought and human deliberation have been replaced by computerized analysis and mathematical models. Technological advances have made finance faster, larger, more global, more interconnected, and less human. Modern finance is becoming an industry in which the main players are no longer entirely human. Instead, the key players are now cyborgs: part machine, part human. Modem finance is transforming into what this Article calls cyborg finance.
   This Article offers one of the first broad, descriptive, and normative examinations of this sea change and its wide-ranging effects on law, society, and finance. The Article begins by placing the rise of artificial intelligence and computerization in finance within a larger social context. Next, it explores the evolution and birth of a new investor paradigm in law precipitated by that rise. This Article then identifies and addresses regulatory dangers, challenges, and consequences tied to the increasing reliance on artificial intelligence and computers. Specifically, it warns of emerging financial threats in cyberspace, examines new systemic risks linked to speed and connectivity, studies law's capacity to govern this evolving financial landscape, and explores the growing resource asymmetries in finance. Finally, drawing on themes from the legal discourse about the choice between rules and standards, this Article closes with a defense of humans in an uncertain financial world in which machines continue to rise, and it asserts that smarter humans working with smart machines possess the key to better returns and better futures.

The study was conducted in four different citrus field trials, located in Highlands County and in Polk County, Florida, USA. In each location, trials contained either 'Hamlin' or 'Valencia' sweet orange scion grafted on more than 30 different rootstocks. Leaves were collected and analyzed in the laboratory to determine macro- and micronutrient concentration using traditional chemical methods. Spectral data from tree canopies were obtained in five different bands (red, green, blue, red edge and near-infrared wavelengths) using a UAV equipped with a multispectral camera. The estimation model was developed using a gradient boosting regression tree and evaluated using several metrics including mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error, MAPE-coefficient of variance (CV) ratio and difference plot. This novel model determined macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, calcium and sulfur) with high precision (less than 9% and 17% average error for the 'Hamlin' and 'Valencia' trials, respectively) and micro-nutrients with moderate precision (less than 16% and 30% average error for 'Hamlin' and 'Valencia' trials, respectively). Overall, this UAV- and AI-based methodology was efficient to determine nutrient concentrations and generate nutrient maps in commercial citrus orchards and could be applied to other crop species.

AB With more corporations incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) tools like social chatbots into their public communication practices, we explore optimal chatbot designs for organization-public relational outcomes. Our 2 x 2 x 2 factorial web experiment with eight custom-designed chatbots showed that communication strategies (verbal and non-verbal social cues such as emoji, memes, filler words, and response delay) had a significant impact (Cohen's d = 0.536, standardized coefficient beta = 0.438) on chatbot social conversation, the central antecedent to the investigated relational outcomes such as trust in business. Furthermore, the effect of chatbot social conversation is partially mediated by perceived organizational listening, highlighting the importance of listening and its related theories and practices in automated business communication.

AB Delivering the appropriate amount of chemicals for each plant based on their needs is essential for reducing costs, waste, and labor. Smart agricultural machinery can provide variable-rate technologies using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine vision to optimize spraying applications. In this research, a low-cost smart sensing system for controlling airblast tree crop sprayers was designed and evaluated using citrus as a case study. The prototype comprised a LiDAR, machine vision, GPS, flow meters, sensor fusion, and AI to scan trees for tree height, tree classification, and fruit counting. Specifically, this smart sensing system can detect and classify objects to tree or non-tree (e.g., human, field constructions), measure tree height and canopy density, and detect and count fruit. Based on this information, it controls spraying nozzles to optimize spraying applications. A novel software was written in C++ and ran on an Nvidia Jetson Xavier NX embedded computer to process and control the data utilizing data fusion and AI techniques. The smart sensing system's results for tree height estimate indicated a relatively low average error of 6%. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to perform tree classification with an average accuracy of 84% in classifying the collected imagery into mature, young, dead, and non-tree objects. The fruit count module (also a CNN) had an F1 score of 89%, compared to ground-truth labeled images of mature and immature citrus fruits. Finally, the adoption of this new sensing method reduced spraying volume by 28%, compared to traditional spraying applications.

AB Platelets play a critical role in blood clotting and the development of arterial blockages. Antiplatelet therapy is vital for preventing recurring events in conditions like coronary artery disease and strokes. However, there is a lack of comprehensive guidelines for using antiplatelet agents in elective neurosurgery. Continuing therapy during surgery poses a bleeding risk, while discontinuing it before surgery increases the risk of thrombosis. Discontinuation is recommended in neurosurgical settings but carries an elevated risk of ischemic events. Conversely, maintaining antithrombotic therapy may increase bleeding and the need for transfusions, leading to a poor prognosis. Artificial intelligence (AI) holds promise in making difficult decisions regarding antiplatelet therapy. This paper discusses current clinical guidelines and supported regimens for antiplatelet therapy in neurosurgery. It also explores methodologies like P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) monitoring and thromboelastography (TEG) mapping for monitoring the use of antiplatelet regimens as well as their limitations. The paper explores the potential of AI to overcome such limitations associated with PRU monitoring and TEG mapping. It highlights various studies in the field of cardiovascular and neuroendovascular surgery which use AI prediction models to forecast adverse outcomes such as ischemia and bleeding, offering assistance in decision-making for antiplatelet therapy. In addition, the use of AI to improve patient adherence to antiplatelet regimens is also considered. Overall, this research aims to provide insights into the use of antiplatelet therapy and the role of AI in optimizing treatment plans in neurosurgical settings.

AB Deep neural networks (DNNs) have transformed the field of computer vision and currently constitute some of the best models for representations learned via hierarchical processing in the human brain. In medical imaging, these models have shown human-level performance and even higher in the early diagnosis of a wide range of diseases. However, the goal is often not only to accurately predict group membership or diagnose but also to provide explanations that support the model decision in a context that a human can readily interpret. The limited transparency has hindered the adoption of DNN algorithms across many domains. Numerous explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques have been developed to peer inside the "black box " and make sense of DNN models, taking somewhat divergent approaches. Here, we suggest that these methods may be considered in light of the interpretation goal, including functional or mechanistic interpretations, developing archetypal class instances, or assessing the relevance of certain features or mappings on a trained model in a post-hoc capacity. We then focus on reviewing recent applications of post-hoc relevance techniques as applied to neuroimaging data. Moreover, this article suggests a method for comparing the reliability of XAI methods, especially in deep neural networks, along with their advantages and pitfalls.

AB Background and Aims: Alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) poses significant short-term mortality. Existing prognostic models lack precision for 90-day mortality. Utilizing artificial intelligence in a global cohort, we sought to derive and validate an enhanced prognostic model. Approach and Results: The Global AlcHep initiative, a retrospective study across 23 centers in 12 countries, enrolled patients with AH per National Institute for Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism criteria. Centers were partitioned into derivation (11 centers, 860 patients) and validation cohorts (12 centers, 859 patients). Focusing on 30 and 90-day postadmission mortality, 3 artificial intelligence algorithms (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting) informed an ensemble model, subsequently refined through Bayesian updating, integrating the derivation cohort's average 90-day mortality with each center's approximate mortality rate to produce posttest probabilities. The ALCoholic Hepatitis Artificial INtelligence Ensemble score integrated age, gender, cirrhosis, and 9 laboratory values, with center-specific mortality rates. Mortality was 18.7% (30 d) and 27.9% (90 d) in the derivation cohort versus 21.7% and 32.5% in the validation cohort. Validation cohort 30 and 90-day AUCs were 0.811 (0.779-0.844) and 0.799 (0.769-0.830), significantly surpassing legacy models like Maddrey's Discriminant Function, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease variations, age-serum bilirubin-international normalized ratio-serum Creatinine score, Glasgow, and modified Glasgow Scores (p < 0.001). ALCoholic Hepatitis Artificial INtelligence Ensemble score also showcased superior calibration against MELD and its variants. Steroid use improved 30-day survival for those with an ALCoholic Hepatitis Artificial INtelligence Ensemble score > 0.20 in both derivation and validation cohorts. Conclusions: Harnessing artificial intelligence within a global consortium, we pioneered a scoring system excelling over traditional models for 30 and 90-day AH mortality predictions.

AB Robots and artificial intelligence (AI) have seen increased adoption in healthcare. These health technologies have the capability of providing tailored messages and feedback to each individual. Thus, a robot can potentially serve as a personal health advisor, particularly for health issues that could be benefited through regular guidance and instructions. However, there is a limited understanding of how people might respond to the idea that their health advisor could be a robot. Thus, the present study employs the technology acceptance model (TAM) to examine intentions to adopt a robotic health advisor. Findings demonstrate that perceived ease of communication with and perceived usefulness of a robotic health advisor positively predict favorable attitudes toward a robotic health advisor, which subsequently leads to strong intentions to adopt it. The present investigation also finds that perceived usefulness of a robotic health advisor directly leads to an individual's intentions to adopt it. Overall, the present study provides important implications for perceptions of a robotic health advisor.

AB Building upon the communication privacy management theory, the research reveals the effect of self-disclosure on the identified mechanisms of perceived emotional value, performance expectancy, and privacy concerns, which in turn, influence customers' intention to compliment and complain via AI-enabled platforms. Findings from two quasi-experiments with 439 valid responses from U.S. customers suggest that customers are more likely to express their feelings when low self-disclosure AI technology is presented. The results suggest a prominent role of privacy concerns in mediating the effect of self-disclosure on customers' intention to compliment and complain. The effects of self-disclosure also channel through perceived emotional value and performance expectancy when customers want to leave a compliment. The moderating effect of reward timing was examined. Similarities and differences between customers' intentions to compliment or complain using AI-enabled platforms are discussed to provide theoretical and practical implications.

AB Specialty crop growers face challenges from numerous diseases and pests. For example, the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) is a key pest of citrus due to its role as vector of huanglongbing (HLB) (greening disease). There is no known cure for HLB, but vector management is critical, both for slowing spread and attenuating symptoms in infected trees. Therefore, monitoring ACP population, as well as other pest populations, is an essential management component for timing and assessment of control actions. Manual crop scouting is often labor intensive and time consuming. In this work, an automated system was developed and evaluated utilizing machine vision and artificial intelligence to monitor ACP in groves. This system comprised a tapping mechanism to collect insects from the tree's branches and a board with a grid of cameras for image acquisition. A software was developed using two convolutional neural-networks to accurately detect and distinguish psyllids from other insects and debris fallen from the tree. A GPS was utilized to automatically record individual tree position to facilitate data assessment on large groves. A precision and recall of 80% and 95%, respectively, was obtained on detecting ACPs on a sample of 90 young citrus trees. The system proved a great potential to automate scouting procedures in citrus and to be extended to other crop insects.

ID ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE
AB Advocates of AI in Education (AIEd) assert that the current generation of technologies, collectively dubbed artificial intelligence, including generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), promise results that can transform our conceptions of what education looks like. Therefore, it is imperative to investigate how educators perceive GenAI and its potential use and future impact on education. Adopting the methodology of collective writing as an inquiry, this study reports on the participating educators' perceived grey areas (i.e. issues that are unclear and/or controversial) and recommendations on future research. The grey areas reported cover decision-making on the use of GenAI, AI ethics, appropriate levels of use of GenAI in education, impact on learning and teaching, policy, data, GenAI outputs, humans in the loop and public-private partnerships. Recommended directions for future research include learning and teaching, ethical and legal implications, ownership/authorship, funding, technology, research support, AI metaphor and types of research. Each theme or subtheme is presented in the form of a statement, followed by a justification. These findings serve as a call to action to encourage a continuing debate around GenAI and to engage more educators in research. The paper concludes that unless we can ask the right questions now, we may find that, in the pursuit of greater efficiency, we have lost the very essence of what it means to educate and learn.

AB Objective:To summarize state-of-the-art artificial intelligence-enabled decision support in surgery and to quantify deficiencies in scientific rigor and reporting. Background:To positively affect surgical care, decision-support models must exceed current reporting guideline requirements by performing external and real-time validation, enrolling adequate sample sizes, reporting model precision, assessing performance across vulnerable populations, and achieving clinical implementation; the degree to which published models meet these criteria is unknown. Methods:Embase, PubMed, and MEDLINE databases were searched from their inception to September 21, 2022 for articles describing artificial intelligence-enabled decision support in surgery that uses preoperative or intraoperative data elements to predict complications within 90 days of surgery. Scientific rigor and reporting criteria were assessed and reported according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. Results:Sample size ranged from 163-2,882,526, with 8/36 articles (22.2%) featuring sample sizes of less than 2000; 7 of these 8 articles (87.5%) had below-average (<0.83) area under the receiver operating characteristic or accuracy. Overall, 29 articles (80.6%) performed internal validation only, 5 (13.8%) performed external validation, and 2 (5.6%) performed real-time validation. Twenty-three articles (63.9%) reported precision. No articles reported performance across sociodemographic categories. Thirteen articles (36.1%) presented a framework that could be used for clinical implementation; none assessed clinical implementation efficacy. Conclusions:Artificial intelligence-enabled decision support in surgery is limited by reliance on internal validation, small sample sizes that risk overfitting and sacrifice predictive performance, and failure to report confidence intervals, precision, equity analyses, and clinical implementation. Researchers should strive to improve scientific quality.

AB While fact-checking has received much attention as a tool to fight misinformation online, fact-checking efforts have yielded limited success in combating political misinformation due to partisans' biased information processing. The efficacy of fact-checking often decreases, if not backfires, when the fact-checking messages contradict individual audiences' political stance. To explore ways to minimize such politically biased processing of fact-checking messages, an online experiment (N = 645) examined how different source labels of fact-checking messages (human experts vs. AI vs. crowdsourcing vs. human experts-AI hybrid) influence partisans' processing of fact-checking messages. Results showed that AI and crowdsourcing source labels significantly reduced motivated reasoning in evaluating the credibility of fact-checking messages whereas the partisan bias remained evident for the human experts and human experts-AI hybrid source labels.

DE MACHINE LEARNING; KNOWLEDGE STRUCTURES; QUALITATIVE-RESPONSE MODELS;

AB Many unstructured decision-making problems are too complex to be solved by existing analytical methods. Organizations commonly rely on human expertise to solve such problems. Human expertise is presumed to utilize specialized knowledge structures, and recent research in artificial intelligence has sought to devise machine-learning procedures that can derive knowledge structures from sets of data that represent problem-domain exemplars. Concurrently, research in statistical methods has resulted in the development of qualitative-response models that can be applied to some of the same kinds of problems addressed by machine-learning models-especially those that involve a classification decision. Using a difficult audit decision problem requiring expertise, this paper reports on a study comparing performance of two machine-learning algorithms and logistic regression, a widely-used qualitative-response method for classification analysis. A recently-developed machine-learning algorithm, NEWQ, is found to yield the best performance characteristics.

AB To support creativity, one should first assess it accurately. New techniques such as stealth assessment that use digital environments (e.g. digital games) can be used to assess and support creativity. In this paper, I discuss my passion for creativity and how my academic journey in creativity research started. Then, I discuss key studies and papers I wrote with my colleagues (including my Ph.D. dissertation). Specifically, I discuss the effectiveness of digital games on creativity, the effectiveness of creativity support tools in digital games, and the stealth assessment of creativity in a Physics game. Finally, I conclude with the future directions of my research in these areas and other areas such as the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in assessing and supporting creativity.

AB The purpose of this research study was to examine the overall effect of adaptive learning systems deployed using artificial intelligence technology across a range of relevant variables (e.g., duration, student level, etc.). Following a systematic procedure, this meta-analysis examined literature from 18 academic databases and identified N = 45 independent studies utilizing AI-enabled adaptive learning. This meta-analysis examined the overall effect of AI-enabled adaptive learning systems on students' cognitive learning outcomes when compared with non-adaptive learning interventions and found that they have a medium to large positive effect size (g = 0.70). The effect was significantly moderated by publication type, origin of study, student classification level, student discipline, duration, and research design. In addition, all three adaptive sources (cognitive, affective, and behavioral) and adaptive targets (navigation and assessment) were significant moderators. The type of AI used in the adaptive engine did not moderate the effects. Implications for both practice and research are provided.

AB Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models are useful tools in drug development and risk assessment of environmental chemicals. PBPK model development requires the collection of species-specific physiological, and chemical-specific absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) parameters, which can be a time-consuming and expensive process. This raises a need to create computational models capable of predicting input parameter values for PBPK models, especially for new compounds. In this review, we summarize an emerging paradigm for integrating PBPK modeling with machine learning (ML) or artificial intelligence (AI)-based computational methods. This paradigm includes 3 steps (1) obtain time-concentration PK data and/or ADME parameters from publicly available databases, (2) develop ML/AI-based approaches to predict ADME parameters, and (3) incorporate the ML/AI models into PBPK models to predict PK summary statistics (eg, area under the curve and maximum plasma concentration). We also discuss a neural network architecture "neural ordinary differential equation (Neural-ODE)" that is capable of providing better predictive capabilities than other ML methods when used to directly predict time-series PK profiles. In order to support applications of ML/AI methods for PBPK model development, several challenges should be addressed (1) as more data become available, it is important to expand the training set by including the structural diversity of compounds to improve the prediction accuracy of ML/AI models; (2) due to the black box nature of many ML models, lack of sufficient interpretability is a limitation; (3) Neural-ODE has great potential to be used to generate time-series PK profiles for new compounds with limited ADME information, but its application remains to be explored. Despite existing challenges, ML/AI approaches will continue to facilitate the efficient development of robust PBPK models for a large number of chemicals.

AB Objectives We aimed to evaluate the performance of a publicly-available online artificial intelligence program (OpenAI's ChatGPT-3.5 and -4.0, August 3 versions) on a pediatric board preparatory examination, 2021 and 2022 PREP (R) Self-Assessment, American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).Methods We entered 245 questions and answer choices from the Pediatrics 2021 PREP (R) Self-Assessment and 247 questions and answer choices from the Pediatrics 2022 PREP (R) Self-Assessment into OpenAI's ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4.0, August 3 versions, in September 2023. The ChatGPT-3.5 and 4.0 scores were compared with the advertised passing scores (70%+) for the PREP (R) exams and the average scores (74.09%) and (75.71%) for all 10 715 and 6825 first-time human test takers.Results For the AAP 2021 and 2022 PREP (R) Self-Assessments, ChatGPT-3.5 answered 143 of 243 (58.85%) and 137 of 247 (55.46%) questions correctly on a single attempt. ChatGPT-4.0 answered 193 of 243 (79.84%) and 208 of 247 (84.21%) questions correctly.Conclusion Using a publicly-available online chatbot to answer pediatric board preparatory examination questions yielded a passing score but demonstrated significant limitations in the chatbot's ability to assess some complex medical situations in children, posing a potential risk to this vulnerable population.

AB AI has become increasingly relevant to the media sector, especially for news media companies considering the integration of this technology into their production processes. While the application of AI promises productivity gains, the impact on consumers' perceptions of the resulting news and the level of AI integration accepted by the market has not been well studied. Our research focused on the analysis of news consumers' preferred level of AI integration, AI news trust, and AI news usage intentions linked to the application of the technology in the discovery/information-gathering and writing/editing phases. By connecting a comprehensive set of factors influencing the perception of news and AI, we approached this gap through structural equation modeling, presenting an overview of consumers' responses to AI integration into news production processes. Our research showed that while participants generally prefer lower levels of AI integration into both phases of production, news trust and usage intention can even increase as AI enters the production process-as long as humans remain in the lead. These findings provide researchers and news media managers with a first overview of consumers' responses to news production augmentation and its implications for news perception in the market.

TI ASSUMING THE RISKS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
SO BOSTON UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID ASSUMPTION
AB Tort law has long served as a remedy for those injured by products and injuries from artificial intelligence ("AI") are no exception. While many scholars have rightly contemplated the possible tort claims involving AI-driven technologies that cause injury, there has been little focus on the subsequent analysis of defenses. One of these defenses, assumption of risk, has been given particularly short shrift, with most scholars addressing it only in passing. This is intriguing, particularly because assumption of risk has the power to completely bar recovery for a plaintiff who knowingly and voluntarily engaged with a risk. In reality, such a defense may prove vital to shaping the likelihood of success for these prospective plaintiffs injured by AI, first-adopters who are often eager to "voluntarily" use the new technology but simultaneously often lacking in "knowledge" about AI's risks.
   To remedy this oversight in the scholarship, this Article tackles assumption of risk head-on, demonstrating why this defense may have much greater influence on the course of the burgeoning new field of "AI torts" than originally believed. It analyzes the historic application of assumption of risk to emerging technologies, extrapolating its potential use in the context of damages caused by robotic, autonomous, and facial recognition technologies. This Article then analyzes assumption of risk's relationship to informed consent, another key doctrine that revolves around appreciation of risks, demonstrating how an extension of informed consent principles to assumption of risk can establish a more nuanced approach for a future that is sure to involve an increasing number of AI-human interactions-and AI torts. In addition to these AI-human interactions, this Article's reevaluation also can help in other assumption of risk analyses and tort law generally to better address the evolving innovation-risk-consent trilemma.

AB Mathematical stories can enhance students' motivation and interest in learning mathematics, thereby positively impacting their academic performance. However, due to resource constraints faced by the creators, generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is employed to create mathematical stories accompanied by images. This study introduces a method for automatically assessing the quality of these multimodal stories by evaluating text-image coherence and textual readability. Using GAI-generated stories for grades 3 to 5 from the US math story learning platform Read Solve Create (RSC), we extracted features related to multimodal semantics and text readability. We then analysed the correlation between these features and student engagement levels, measured by average reading time per story (behavioural engagement) and average drawing tool usage per story (cognitive engagement), derived from browsing logs and interaction metrics on the platform. Our findings reveal that textual features such as conjunctive adverbs, sentence connectors, causal connectives and simplified vocabulary positively correlate with behavioural engagement. Additionally, higher semantic similarity between text and images, as well as the number of operators in the stories, is associated with increased cognitive engagement. This study advances the application of GAI in mathematics education and offers novel insights for instructional material design.

AB Oculomics is an emerging field that leverages ophthalmic imaging data to identify biomarkers of systemic disease, facilitating early diagnosis and risk stratification. Despite its growing recognition, gaps remain in the literature regarding the clinical applications of oculomics. Various systemic diseases-including metabolic disorders (e.g., diabetes mellitus), infectious diseases (e.g., COVID-19), neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., dementia), hematologic disorders (e.g., thalassemia), autoimmune conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), and genetic syndromes (e.g., Fabry disease)-exhibit ocular manifestations detectable through in vivo confocal microscopy and anterior segment optical coherence tomography, among other imaging modalities. Increasing evidence supports the role of corneal imaging in identifying systemic disease biomarkers, a process further enhanced by artificial intelligence-driven analyses. This review synthesizes the current findings on corneal biomarkers of systemic disease, their ophthalmic imaging correlates, and the expanding role of corneal oculomics in translational medicine. Additionally, we explore future directions for integrating oculomics into clinical practice and biomedical research.

AB As medicine enters the era of artificial intelligence (AI)-augmented practice, dermatology is beginning to witness the integration of AI into the daily practice, particularly in the areas of diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of skin diseases. Many of the current electronic medical records that dermatologists have incorporated provide guidance in billing, a form of AI at work. The recent advances in visual recognition AI make application and integration of the technology particularly suited for perceptual specialties such as radiology and dermatology. In dermatology, AI is poised to improve the efficiency and accuracy of traditional diagnostic approaches, including visual examination, skin biopsy, and histopathologic examination. This review highlights the current progress of AI in dermatology and provides a basic overview of the technology. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tools across various domains has showcased their remarkable capabilities and performance. Black-box AI models raise concerns about decision transparency and user confidence. Therefore, explainable AI (XAI) and explainability techniques have rapidly emerged in recent years. This paper aims to review existing works on explainability techniques in bioinformatics, with a particular focus on omics and imaging. We seek to analyze the growing demand for XAI in bioinformatics, identify current XAI approaches, and highlight their limitations. Our survey emphasizes the specific needs of both bioinformatics applications and users when developing XAI methods and we particularly focus on omics and imaging data. Our analysis reveals a significant demand for XAI in bioinformatics, driven by the need for transparency and user confidence in decision-making processes. At the end of the survey, we provided practical guidelines for system developers.

AB The value and welfare of performance horses is closely tied to locomotor behaviors, but we lack objective and quantitative measures for these characteristics, and qualitative approaches for assessing gait do not provide measures suitable for large-scale biomechanical research studies. Digital video analysis utilizing artificial intelligence-based strategies holds promise to meet the need for an economical, accurate, repeatable and objective technique for field quantification of equine locomotion. Here we describe pilot work using a consumerlevel digital video camera to capture high-resolution and high-speed videos of horses moving at the trot during mandatory inspections for international-level eventing competitions. We assessed 194 horses from five different competition venues, recorded at pre-competition (first) and post-cross-country (second) inspections as a model of gait change following exertion. We labeled twenty-six keypoints on each frame with DeepLabCut and processed the resulting tracking data using MatLab to derive quantitative gait parameters. Once trained, the DeepLabCut model labeled the 388 videos in just minutes, a task that would have otherwise taken months of human effort to complete. A Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) examining seven gait parameters identified significant changes in duty factor, speed, and forelimb swing range following the completion of the cross-country phase (P <= 0.05). Despite some limitations, video analysis through artificial intelligence proved capable of quantifying several gait parameters quickly, efficiently, and without the need for specialized equipment, making this tool a promising option for future biomechanical research in the athletic horse.

AB The first objective of this study was to develop a model for the peak concrete temperature (T) based on predictors known as its primary influencers and verified by an artificial neural network (ANN). The second objective was to gauge the influence of the level of replacement of Portland cement (PC) with fly ash class F (FA) and slag cement (Slag) and the variation in the cementitious materials content in concrete (Wc) in typical mass concrete mixtures on T. The least dimension (LD), the concrete temperature at placement (CT), Wc, Slag and FA contents, in addition to tricalcium silicate (C3S) and tricalcium aluminate (C3A) in PC and the Fineness (F) of PC, were investigated. The temperatures of 111 massive elements with FA were simulated 43,768 times with the Levenberg-Marquardt (LMA) and Bayesian (Bayes) models in the ANN. The temperatures of 72 massive elements with Slag were simulated 78,255 times. The T of massive elements appeared better characterized by multivariate regressions. The variables that significantly affected the T seemed to be the LD, CT, and C3S content in PC-FA systems and the LD, CT, and Slag in PC-Slag systems. The LD appeared to exercise the most significant influence on T in both cementitious systems. High substitution levels of PC with FA and Slag should generate different effects. Slag appears to be more significant to T in this scenario. The accuracy of multivariate models trained by ANN algorithms and the low significance of Wc to control temperatures of a particular concrete class were revealing.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely adopted in higher education. However, the current research on AI in higher education is limited lacking both breadth and depth. The present study fills the research gap by exploring faculty members' perception on teaching AI and data science related courses facilitated by an open experiential AI platform. Specifically, two focus groups are conducted among computer science and non-computer science faculty members to gauge their perception on the integration of AI in an experiential learning platform to teach data science, as well as their perception on AI powered data science curriculum in higher education. Findings reveal three major themes which are defining data science, assembling interdisciplinary teams, and building platform for connection. The study has both theoretical and practical implications.

AB PurposeWith the trend of adopting and studying artificial intelligence (AI) service robots at restaurants, the authors' understanding of how customers perceive robots differently across restaurant segments remains limited. Therefore, building upon expectancy theory, this study aims to propose a trust-based mechanism to explain customers' support for AI-based service robots. Design/methodology/approachFor cross-segment validation, data were collected from online survey participants under the scenarios of experiencing AI service robots in luxury (n = 428), fine-dining (n = 420), casual (n = 409) and quick-service (n = 410) restaurant scenarios. FindingsIn all four segments, trust in technology increased willingness to accept AI service robots, which was then positively related to customers' support for AI-based service robots. Meanwhile, customers' AI performance expectancy mediated the relationship between trust in technology and willingness to accept AI service robots. On the other hand, at luxury, fine-dining and casual restaurants, males perceived a stronger positive relationship between trust in technology and AI performance expectancy. No generational differences were found in the four restaurant segments between trust in technology and AI performance expectancy. Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is one of the first attempts in hospitality research to examine cross-segment validation of customers' responses to AI-based service robots in the luxury, fine-dining, casual and quick-service restaurant segments.

AB This review provides an overview of apple detection and localization using image analysis and artificial intelligence techniques for enabling robotic fruit harvesting in orchard environments. Classic methods for detecting and localizing infield apples are discussed along with more advanced approaches using deep learning algorithms that have emerged in the past few years. Challenges faced in apple detection and localization such as occlusions, varying illumination conditions, and clustered apples are highlighted, as well as the impact of environmental factors such as light changes on the performance of these algorithms. Potential future research perspectives are identified through a comprehensive literature analysis. These include combining cutting-edge deep learning and multi-vision and multi-modal sensors to potentially apply them in real-time for apple harvesting robots. Additionally, utilizing 3D vision for a thorough analysis of complex and dynamic orchard environments, and precise determination of fruit locations using point cloud data and depth information are presented. The outcome of this review paper will assist researchers and engineers in the development of advanced detection and localization mechanisms for infield apples. The anticipated result is the facilitation of progress toward commercial apple harvest robots.

AB Cell movement is known to be fundamental to many processes that take part in the overall functioning of life itself. Regeneration of damaged tissue, tumor growth or the creation of life itself through embryogenesis rely mainly on the individual and collective movement of cells. Due to the importance of such phenomena, increasing research activity has been dedicated to them, but many are the questions that still remain, specially when focusing on the movement of clusters and networks of cells as a whole. We present a new approach to take advantage of Machine Learning tools (Artificial Neural Networks) in order to predict the position and velocity of a cell in a certain moment in time, given the properties of said cell and the environment surrounding it. The results show a high level of accuracy for the analyzed video sequence, which implies that the studied properties greatly influence the decisions taken by cells regarding its movement.

AB Kidney pathophysiology is often complex, nonlinear and heterogeneous, which limits the utility of hypothetical-deductive reasoning and linear, statistical approaches to diagnosis and treatment. Emerging evidence suggests that artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled decision support systems - which use algorithms based on learned examples - may have an important role in nephrology. Contemporary AI applications can accurately predict the onset of acute kidney injury before notable biochemical changes occur; can identify modifiable risk factors for chronic kidney disease onset and progression; can match or exceed human accuracy in recognizing renal tumours on imaging studies; and may augment prognostication and decision-making following renal transplantation. Future AI applications have the potential to make real-time, continuous recommendations for discrete actions and yield the greatest probability of achieving optimal kidney health outcomes. Realizing the clinical integration of AI applications will require cooperative, multidisciplinary commitment to ensure algorithm fairness, overcome barriers to clinical implementation, and build an AI-competent workforce. AI-enabled decision support should preserve the pre-eminence of wisdom and augment rather than replace human decision-making. By anchoring intuition with objective predictions and classifications, this approach should favour clinician intuition when it is honed by experience.
   Emerging evidence suggests that artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled decision support systems may have an important role in the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of kidney diseases. This Review provides an overview of AI fundamentals and the state of the art of AI-enabled decision support systems in nephrology.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to revolutionize family medicine, offering a transformative approach to achieving the Quintuple Aim. This article examines the imperative for family medicine to adapt to the rapidly evolving field of AI, with an emphasis on its integration in clinical practice. AI's recent advancements have the potential to significantly transform health care. We argue for the proactive engagement of family medicine in directing AI technologies toward enhancing the "Quintuple Aim." The article highlights potential benefits of AI, such as improved patient outcomes through enhanced diagnostic tools, clinician well-being through reduced administrative burdens, and the promotion of health equity by analyzing diverse data sets. However, we also acknowledge the risks associated with AI, including the potential for automation to diverge from patient-centered care and exacerbate health care disparities. Our recommendations stress the need for family medicine education to incorporate AI literacy, the development of a collaborative for AI integration, and the establishment of guidelines and standards through interdisciplinary cooperation. We conclude that although AI poses challenges, its responsible and ethical implementation can revolutionize family medicine, optimizing patient care and enhancing the role of clinicians in a technology-driven future.

AB The need for interpretable and accountable intelligent systems grows along with the prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI) applications used in everyday life. Explainable AI (XAI) systems are intended to selfexplain the reasoning behind system decisions and predictions. Researchers from different disciplines work together to define, design, and evaluate explainable systems. However, scholars from different disciplines focus on different objectives and fairly independent topics of XAI research, which poses challenges for identifying appropriate design and evaluation methodology and consolidating knowledge across efforts. To this end, this article presents a survey and framework intended to share knowledge and experiences of XAI design and evaluation methods across multiple disciplines. Aiming to support diverse design goals and evaluation methods in XAI research, after a thorough review of XAI related papers in the fields of machine learning, visualization, and human-computer interaction, we present a categorization of XAI design goals and evaluation methods. Our categorization presents the mapping between design goals for different XAI user groups and their evaluation methods. From our findings, we develop a framework with step-by-step design guidelines paired with evaluation methods to close the iterative design and evaluation cycles in multidisciplinary XAI teams. Further, we provide summarized ready-to-use tables of evaluation methods and recommendations for different goals in XAI research.

AB The advent of artificial intelligence and Internet of Things has led to the seamless transition turning the big data into the big knowledge. The deep learning models, which assimilate knowledge from large-scale data, can he regarded as an alternative but promising modality of knowledge for artificial intelligence services. Yet, the compression, storage, and communication of the deep learning models towards better knowledge services, especially over networks, pose a set of challenging problems on both industrial and academic realms. This paper presents the deep learning model communication paradigm based on multiple model compression, which greatly exploits the redundancy among multiple deep learning models in different application scenarios. We analyze the potential and demonstrate the promise of the compression strategy for deep learning model communication through a set of experiments. Moreover, the interoperability in deep learning model communication, which is enabled based on the standardization of compact deep learning model representation, is also discussed and envisioned.

ID HEALTH-CARE; MACHINE; PREDICTION; MORTALITY; BIAS
AB Advancements in computing and data from the near universal acceptance and implementation of electronic health records has been formative for the growth of personalized, automated, and immediate patient care models that were not previously possible. Artificial intelligence (AI) and its subfields of machine learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning are well-suited to deal with such data. The authors in this paper review current applications of AI in clinical medicine and discuss the most likely future contributions that AI will provide to the healthcare industry. For instance, in response to the need to risk stratify patients, appropriately cultivated and curated data can assist decision-makers in stratifying preoperative patients into risk categories, as well as categorizing the severity of ailments and health for non-operative patients admitted to hospitals. Previous overt, traditional vital signs and laboratory values that are used to signal alarms for an acutely decompensating patient may be replaced by continuously monitoring and updating AI tools that can pick up early imperceptible patterns predicting subtle health deterioration. Furthermore, AI may help overcome challenges with multiple outcome optimization limitations or sequential decision-making protocols that limit individualized patient care. Despite these tremendously helpful advancements, the data sets that AI models train on and develop have the potential for misapplication and thereby create concerns for application bias. Subsequently, the mechanisms governing this disruptive innovation must be understood by clinical decision-makers to prevent unnecessary harm. This need will force physicians to change their educational infrastructure to facilitate understanding AI platforms, modeling, and limitations to best acclimate practice in the age of AI. By performing a thorough narrative review, this paper examines these specific AI applications, limitations, and requisites while reviewing a few examples of major data sets that are being cultivated and curated in the US.

AB The critical barrier for clinical translation of cancer nanomedicine stems from the inefficient delivery of nanoparticles (NPs) to target solid tumors. Rapid growth of computational power, new machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches provide new tools to address this challenge. In this study, we established an AIassisted physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model by integrating an AI-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model with a PBPK model to simulate tumor-targeted delivery efficiency (DE) and biodistribution of various NPs. The AI-based QSAR model was developed using machine learning and deep neural network algorithms that were trained with datasets from a published "Nano-Tumor Database" to predict critical input parameters of the PBPK model. The PBPK model with optimized NP cellular uptake kinetic parameters was used to predict the maximum delivery efficiency (DEmax) and DE at 24 (DE24) and 168 h (DE168) of different NPs in the tumor after intravenous injection and achieved a determination coefficient of R2 = 0.83 [root mean squared error (RMSE) = 3.01] for DE24, R2 = 0.56 (RMSE = 2.27) for DE168, and R2 = 0.82 (RMSE = 3.51) for DEmax. The AI-PBPK model predictions correlated well with available experimentallymeasured pharmacokinetic profiles of different NPs in tumors after intravenous injection (R2 & GE; 0.70 for 133 out of 288 datasets). This AI-based PBPK model provides an efficient screening tool to rapidly predict delivery efficiency of a NP based on its physicochemical properties without relying on an animal training dataset.

AB Traditional methods of drug design have relied on maximization of drug activity, which, however, often produce highly potent derivatives with equally elevated toxicities, resulting in no change in the therapeutic index. Inclusion of metabolic and toxicological considerations in the drug design process is embodied in retrometabolic concepts. This systemic methodology employs several rules for design of safe drugs, either by metabolic activation (chemical delivery systems) or strategic enzymatic deactivation processes (soft drugs). Automation of these drug design processes was accomplished by artificial intelligence-based computer programs. Thus, new structures are generated from any lead compound, using the ''soft analog'' and the ''inactive metabolite'' approach strategies. All structures are conformationally optimized. Then they are ranked based on calculated properties: solubility and partition characteristics, isosteric-isoelectronic comparison to the lead, and estimated metabolic rates of the predicted enzymatic degradation.

AB Predictive policing, the practice of using of algorithmic systems to forecast crime, is heralded by police departments as the new frontier of crime analysis. At the same time, it is opposed by civil rights groups, academics, and media outlets for being 'biased' and therefore discriminatory against communities of color. This paper argues that the prevailing focus on racial bias has overshadowed two normative factors that are essential to a full assessment of the moral permissibility of predictive policing: fairness in the social distribution of the benefits and burdens of policing as well as the distinctive role of consent in determining fair distribution. When these normative factors are given their due attention, several requirements emerge for the fair implementation of predictive policing. Among these requirements are that police departments inform and solicit buy-in from affected communities about strategic decision-making and that departments favor non-enforcement-oriented interventions.

AB Community resilience provides a paradigm guiding communities' preparedness and mitigation efforts to counter the increasing risks of extreme events (EEs). Knowledge regarding how communities perform during and after EEs can inform proactive resilience enhancement practices. However, the EE impacts on impacted communities are influenced by multiple variables and their implicit interactions, which are difficult to be understood and modeled with conventional mathematical or statistical models. Thus, we calibrate a spatio-temporal deep learning model to capture the dynamics of impacted communities and use explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approach to interpret the influence of communities' social and physical properties on EE impacts. Specifically, we couple graph convolutional neural network (GCN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to model the mobility dynamics for 666 census tracts (i.e., communities) in 14 medium-sized US cities affected by recent hurricanes. The model takes both static variables characterizing communities' preexisting conditions and dynamic variables depicting the changing hazard exposure. The interpretation of the model predictions based on DeepLIFT shows that community resilience, inferred from the perturbation of human mobility in this research, is highly event and geography dependent. Variables including walkability, green spaces, and civil participation generally contribute to fewer mobility perturbations, i.e., resilience contributive, while automobile-oriented accessibility and social vulnerability lead to more mobility perturbations when hazard conditions are controlled. This study empirically validates the mediative role of communities' social and physical properties on EE impacts and promotes more data-driven approaches for understanding and anticipating complex, dynamic, and place-specific community resilience.

AB Integrating prior epidemiological knowledge embedded within mechanistic models with the data-mining capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) offers transformative potential for epidemiological modeling. While the fusion of AI and traditional mechanistic approaches is rapidly advancing, efforts remain fragmented. This scoping review provides a comprehensive overview of emerging integrated models applied across the spectrum of infectious diseases. Through systematic search strategies, we identified 245 eligible studies from 15,460 records. Our review highlights the practical value of integrated models, including advances in disease forecasting, model parameterization, and calibration. However, key research gaps remain. These include the need for better incorporation of realistic decision-making considerations, expanded exploration of diverse datasets, and further investigation into biological and socio-behavioral mechanisms. Addressing these gaps will unlock the synergistic potential of AI and mechanistic modeling to enhance understanding of disease dynamics and support more effective public health planning and response.

AB AI and robots are continuously being used in a variety of health contexts. To better understand this emerging phenomenon of employing machines in healthcare, the present research investigates trust in a robotic health advisor and intentions to adopt it by comparing a robotic health advisor designed to assist with physical health vs. relational health. An online experiment that employed a two-group comparison with a between-subjects design was conducted among 284 undergraduate students in the United States. The primary findings indicate that people report greater trust in a robotic health advisor for physical health compared to relational health, and this relationship is due to the perceived usefulness of a robotic health advisor. Additionally, trust in a robotic health advisor positively predicts intentions to adopt it. The study's findings provide meaningful implications and contributions for research and practice.

AB This study presents one of the earliest empirical investigations on how to harness the power of chatbots for improving key public relations outcomes. Specifically, this study integrates the construct of social presence that has been widely studied in the computer-mediated communication literature with the concept of conversational human voice in public relations to conceptualize chatbots' social conversation. We evaluate chatbots' social conversation as an important antecedent driving user perception, not only of chatbots' listening capability, but also of the organizations' listening efforts, which, in turn, enhance the essential perceptual outcomes of organizational transparency and organization-public relationships. Our theoretical model was tested through an online survey of 778 adult Facebook users in the US, who were directed to have a 5-minute conversation with a real chatbot. The study results advance the organizational listening literature and contribute to the growing body of knowledge on artificial intelligence in public relations.

AB The incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) could deliver a new era in food manufacturing, marked by increased operational efficiencies, higher product quality, and better safety standards. This review offers an in-depth examination of the field's evolution, outlines the leading AI methodologies, and investigates their applications in food manufacturing. This review begins with an introduction to AI and its historical context before classifying the main AI methods used in food manufacturing as machine learning, computer vision, robotics, and natural language processing. Machine learning has emerged as an AI application in many areas of food manufacturing due to its ability to learn from data and make predictions. Computer vision is a popular form of AI and plays an important role in visual inspections, ensuring product consistency and detecting defects. Robotics, in conjunction with AI, has automated a wide range of labour-intensive tasks, from packaging to palletizing, resulting in significant improvements in operational efficiency. Natural language processing has found applications in customer service and compliance, allowing for more efficient interactions and regulatory compliance. AI applications in food manufacturing are numerous and diverse and key areas such as ingredient sorting, quality assessment, process optimization, and supply chain management are highlighted in this review. Finally, we present issues that the industry is encountering in the implementation of AI, as well as a research agenda based on the findings. In-depth analysis provided in this review including the field's evolution, main AI methods used, and their applications in food manufacturing, can provide valuable insights for researchers, practitioners, and decisionmakers in applications of AI in food manufacturing.

AB As incorporation of RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) tags in a wide variety of applications increase, there is a need to ensure the security and privacy of the entity to which these tags are attached. Not surprisingly, this is a very active area as attested by the large number of related published research literature. Recently, the journal engineering applications of artificial intelligence published a paper by Chen and Deng (2009) where the authors propose a mutual authentication protocol for RFID. This protocol has fundamental flaws that can be readily taken advantage by a resourceful adversary. We identify and discuss these vulnerabilities and point out the characteristics of this protocol that exposes it to these vulnerabilities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly advancing, advanced practice nurses must understand and use it responsibly. Here, we describe an assignment in which Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) students learned to use generative text AI. Using our program and course outcomes, developed from the 2021 American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) Essentials competency for DNP students to learn and use AI, we reviewed the literature seeking examples using ChatGPT for the DNP informatics course. No published examples existed to guide us toward infusing a ChatGPT assignment into the course. We developed a novel assignment that included a guide for students on how to use ChatGPT. Students were given time before the assignment to learn the AI/chatbot technology. They were then given the assignment and grading rubric. The assignment was to develop a tool for their current or future practice using ChatGPT. During the course faculty debrief, we learned that few students had questions and the assignment was clear. We also learned that students who sought to develop straightforward, uncomplicated patient tools succeeded with the technology. Those who sought to create something for complex patients had more challenges. Nursing education and practice will be influenced by the increasing prevalence of AI. This manuscript outlines an AI-based assignment for graduate nursing education intended for the students to become familiar with current AI and best practices for patient care. The assignment was well received by students. We plan to use it again in the next course offering.

AB BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) applications aiming to support surgical decision-making processes are generating novel threats to ethical surgical care. To understand and address these threats, we summarize the main ethical issues that may arise from applying AI to surgery, starting from the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence framework recently promoted by the European Commission.
   STUDY DESIGN: A modified Delphi process has been employed to achieve expert consensus.
   RESULTS: The main ethical issues that arise from applying AI to surgery, described in detail here, relate to human agency, accountability for errors, technical robustness, privacy and data governance, transparency, diversity, non-discrimination, and fairness. It may be possible to address many of these ethical issues by expanding the breadth of surgical AI research to focus on implementation science. The potential for AI to disrupt surgical practice suggests that formal digital health education is becoming increasingly important for surgeons and surgical trainees.
   CONCLUSIONS: A multidisciplinary focus on implementation science and digital health education is desirable to balance opportunities offered by emerging AI technologies and respect for the ethical principles of a patient-centric philosophy.

AB This paper proposes and tests a novel model of human-robot interaction and the service robots' acceptance. We used Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze the impact of human-robot interaction (anthropomorphism, perceived intelligence, and perceived social interactivity), psychological (wow effect, emotional presence, and psychological characteristics), utilitarian (perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness) factors and trust on service robot adoption among 446 participants. Our findings show that two main factors influence patron's intention to use service robots: the "wow effect" and ease of use. We also show that human-robot interaction and psychological factors positively influence a patron's perceived ease of use of a robot. Further, psychological factors played a role in influencing patron's trust in the service robot. Finally, for those who preferred interacting with a human, the impact of human-robot interaction factors on ease of use was canceled.

AB Plant diseases can significantly reduce crop yield and product quality. Visual inspections of plants by human observers for disease identification are time-consuming, costly, and prone to error. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have created opportunities for the rapid diagnosis and non-destructive classification of plant pathogens. Several machine vision techniques have been developed to identify and classify plant diseases automatically based on the morphology of specific symptoms. The use of deep learning models has achieved acceptable disease classification results, but they require large datasets for training, which can be labor-intensive, time-consuming, and computationally costly This problem can be solved, to a point, by using data augmentation techniques and generative AI in order to increase the size of the datasets. Furthermore, a combination of deep feature extraction and classification by machine learning was used for accurate disease detection and classification. In some cases, traditional base classifiers trained with small datasets including basic shape, color, and texture features can be feasible for the efficient identification of plant diseases. The performance of such classifiers depends primarily on the features extracted from images; therefore, feature extraction plays a vital role in identifying diseases. Feature engineering, a process to identify the most relevant variables from raw data in order to develop an efficient predictive model, is explored in this paper.

AB The paper is concerned with the development and comparison of alternative machine learning methods of determining the type of truck crossing a bridge from the dynamic response it induces within the bridge structure, the so-called weigh-in-motion problem. Weigh-in-motion is a rich engineering problem presenting many challenges for current machine learning technologies, and for this reason is proposed as a benchmark for guiding and assessing advances in the application of this field of artificial intelligence. A review is first provided of existing methods of determining truck types and loading attributes using both machine learning and heuristic search techniques. The most promising approach to date, that of artificial neural networks, is then compared to support vector machines in a comprehensive study considering a range of configurations of both modeling techniques. A local scatter point smoothing schema is adopted as a means of selecting an optimal set of design parameters for each model type. Three main model formats are considered: (i) a monolithic model structure with a one-versus-all truck type classification strategy; (ii) an array of sub-models each dedicated to one truck type with a one-versus-all classification strategy; and (iii) an array of sub-models each dedicated to selecting between pairs of trucks in a one-versus-one classification strategy. Overall, the formats that used an array of sub-models performed best at truck classification, with the support vector machines having a slight edge over the artificial neural networks. The paper concludes with some suggestions for extending the work to a broader scope of problems.

AB Natural products matter, for they are essential contributors to societal well-being and global health. Flavors, fragrances, essential oils, traditional medicines and phytopharmaceuticals, and prescription and over-the-counter products all utilize constituent materials from natural sources. However, these vast natural resources of Earth are disappearing, and climate change and market expansion by a dramatically increasing and ageing population will continue to strain plant sourcing in the decades ahead. It was with these and other considerations that the term "ecopharmacognosy" was developed as both a philosophy and a practice, and from which the necessity for a "medicines security" strategy evolved.
   Extending previous presentations, a series of sixty challenges for 2030 to the status quo promotes the discussion of a different vision for the natural product sciences as applied to traditional medicines. Among the topics presented are areas for global collaborative initiatives in science and in data management, the impact of climate change on medicinal plant accessibility, the sustainability and quality of the natural products that patients receive, and the integration of new technologies, particularly the genomics of secondary metabolite biosynthesis, hand-held detection systems and artificial intelligence, and the implications of increased life expectancy on future health care needs. The presentation closes with two examples of newer approaches in drug discovery.

AB In small animal practice, patients often present with urinary lithiasis, and prediction of urolith composition is essential to determine the appropriate treatment. Through abdominal radiographs, the composition of mineral radiopaque uroliths can be determined by considering many different factors; this can be complex and, as such, tailor-made for the use of artificial intelligence (AI). The Minnesota Urolith Center partnered with Hill's Pet Nutrition to develop a deep learning AI algorithm (CALCurad) within a smartphone application called the MN Urolith Application that allows for the preliminary assessment of urolith composition. The algorithm provides the probability of a urolith being composed of struvite from an image taken of an abdominal radiograph. This pilot study evaluates the accuracy of the CALCurad in the context of clinical practice. A sample population of 139 dogs was considered, and the results obtained by the CALCurad were compared with the results obtained by infrared spectroscopy analysis. Agreement between the application and quantitative analyses was 81.3%. These results suggest that the CALCurad can effectively be used to predict urolith composition in dogs, helping the clinician to decide between medical and surgical management of the patient. The use of the CALCurad is an example of the usefulness of AI in helping veterinarians make clinical decisions in patient care.

AB Technology advancements made the possibility of artificial intelligence (AI) newscasters a reality. Some news stations across the world have already employed AI to deliver the news, and more news stations may continue this trend. However, little is known about how the audience will respond to news when it is delivered by AI. Thus, the present study investigates people's perceptions about an AI newscaster, compared to a human newscaster, in the context of delivering a weather newscast. Primary findings indicate that people perceive a human newscaster as more credible than an AI newscaster; however, information seeking intentions and behavioral intentions do not differ between the type of newscaster. Further, when listening to a weather newscast delivered by an AI newscaster, the perceived social presence of an AI newscaster is positively associated with greater levels of credibility, information seeking intentions, and behavioral intentions. Collectively, this exploratory research suggests the possibility that AI newscasters can be incorporated to the news broadcasting industry when human resources are limited.

   INFERENCE; NETWORKS; SYSTEMS
AB Although species are central units for biological research, recent findings in genomics are raising awareness that what we call species can be ill-founded entities due to solely morphology-based, regional species descriptions. This particularly applies to groups characterized by intricate evolutionary processes such as hybridization, polyploidy, or asexuality. Here, challenges of current integrative taxonomy (genetics/genomics + morphology + ecology, etc.) become apparent: different vored species concepts, lack of universal characters/markers, missing appropriate analytical tools for intricate evolutionary processes, and highly subjective ranking and fusion of datasets. Now, integrative taxonomy combined with artificial intelligence under a unified species concept can enable automated feature learning and data integration, and thus reduce subjectivity in species delimitation. This proach will likely accelerate revising and unraveling eukaryotic biodiversity.

ID ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; REPAIR; PREDICTION; SIMULATION; MORTALITY
AB Computational surgery (CS) is an interdisciplinary field that uses mathematical models and algorithms to focus specifically on operative planning, simulation, and outcomes analysis to improve surgical care provision. As the digital revolution transforms the surgical work environment through broader adoption of artificial intelligence and machine learning, close collaboration between surgeons and computational scientists is not only unavoidable, but will become essential. In this review, the authors summarize the main advances, as well as ongoing challenges and prospects, that surround the implementation of CS techniques in vascular surgery, with a particular focus on the care of patients affected by abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). Several key areas of AAA care delivery, including patient-specific modelling, virtual surgery simulation, intraoperative imaging-guided surgery, and predictive analytics, as well as biomechanical analysis and machine learning, will be discussed. The overarching goals of these CS applications is to improve the precision and accuracy of AAA repair procedures, while enhancing safety and long-term outcomes. Accordingly, CS has the potential to significantly enhance patient care across the entire surgical journey, from preoperative planning and intraoperative decision making to postoperative surveillance. Moreover, CS-based approaches offer promising opportunities to augment AAA repair quality by enabling precise preoperative simulations, real-time intraoperative navigation, and robust postoperative monitoring. However, integrating these advanced computer-based technologies into medical research and clinical practice presents new challenges. These include addressing technical limitations, ensuring accuracy and reliability, and managing unique ethical considerations associated with their use. Thorough evaluation of these aspects of advanced computation techniques in AAA management is crucial before widespread integration into health care systems can be achieved. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB Objective To evaluate the reliability of three artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots (ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Chatsonic) in generating accurate references from existing obstetric literature. Study Design Between mid-March and late April 2023, ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Chatsonic were prompted to provide references for specific obstetrical randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in 2020. RCTs were considered for inclusion if they were mentioned in a previous article that primarily evaluated RCTs published by the top medical and obstetrics and gynecology journals with the highest impact factors in 2020 as well as RCTs published in a new journal focused on publishing obstetric RCTs. The selection of the three AI models was based on their popularity, performance in natural language processing, and public availability. Data collection involved prompting the AI chatbots to provide references according to a standardized protocol. The primary evaluation metric was the accuracy of each AI model in correctly citing references, including authors, publication title, journal name, and digital object identifier (DOI). Statistical analysis was performed using a permutation test to compare the performance of the AI models. Results Among the 44 RCTs analyzed, Google Bard demonstrated the highest accuracy, correctly citing 13.6% of the requested RCTs, whereas ChatGPT and Chatsonic exhibited lower accuracy rates of 2.4 and 0%, respectively. Google Bard often substantially outperformed Chatsonic and ChatGPT in correctly citing the studied reference components. The majority of references from all AI models studied were noted to provide DOIs for unrelated studies or DOIs that do not exist. Conclusion To ensure the reliability of scientific information being disseminated, authors must exercise caution when utilizing AI for scientific writing and literature search. However, despite their limitations, collaborative partnerships between AI systems and researchers have the potential to drive synergistic advancements, leading to improved patient care and outcomes.

AB Occupational health and safety (OHS) is of the utmost concern in the construction sector. For decades, researchers and practitioners have endeavoured to enhance construction OHS performance through various measures ranging from "hard" technologies (in this paper, the "first wave" of construction OHS management) such as provision of personal protective equipment, to the more recent "soft", managerial approaches (the "second wave") such as fostering a safety culture. Although considerable improvements have been made in construction OHS, the general sentiment is that construction remains one of the most dangerous sectors, warranting more innovative or even revolutionary approaches. This research seeks to develop a smart construction object (SCO)-enabled OHS management system. The central tenet of the system is that artificial intelligence (AI), as the art of creating machines that perform functions that require intelligence when performed by people, represents a direction of the "third wave" in construction OHS management. The system embraces emergent SCOs and harnesses the power of their smart properties of awareness, communicativeness, and autonomy. The system is demonstrated and validated in real-life construction practice and a controlled lab test with a tower crane, the cause of many construction-related injuries and fatalities, as the subject. It is found that the SCO-enabled OHS management system can identify dangerous situations and respond to them autonomously. This research suggests that smarter construction, through incorporation of AI in particular, is a direction of much promise in terms of improving construction OHS.

AB In this paper, we present the need for specialized artificial intelligence (AI) for counterfeit and defect detection of PCB components. Popular computer vision object detection techniques are not sufficient for such dense, low inter-class/high intra-class variation, and limited-data hardware assurance scenarios in which accuracy is paramount. Hence, we explored the limitations of existing object detection methodologies, such as region based convolutional neural networks (RCNNs) and single shot detectors (SSDs), and compared them with our proposed method, the electronic component localization and detection network (ECLAD-Net). The results indicate that, of the compared methods, ECLAD-Net demonstrated the highest performance, with a precision of 87.2% and a recall of 98.9%. Though ECLAD-Net demonstrated decent performance, there is still much progress and collaboration needed from the hardware assurance, computer vision, and deep learning communities for automated, accurate, and scalable PCB assurance.

AB While artificial intelligence (AI)-integrated products continue to surge in the market, research on effectively marketing these products remains scarce. Notably, the emergence of generative AI products has both astonished consumers and prompted businesses to accelerate AI adoption. Yet, for many, AI remains an early adopter's domain. Our study highlights a potential barrier: the varied risk perceptions (RPs) that consumers associate with AI products. This overlooked aspect-coupled with potential risks AI products might present-can significantly diminish consumer trust. To delve into this issue, we utilized the technology acceptance model and diffusion of innovation theory to investigate the influence of RP on AI product purchase intentions. We gathered insights from 344 adults in the United States through an online survey, exploring their multifaceted RPs about generative AI products. Our findings suggest that RP indirectly curtails the willingness to buy AI products, influenced by factors such as product attitudes, perceived utility, and ease of use. Intriguingly, the impact of RP is modulated by an individual's innovativeness level, reflecting their life and consumption patterns. This research enhances our understanding of the intricate interplay of consumer RP, technology acceptance, and product perceptions within the AI product purchase landscape.

AB Participating in online communities has significant benefits to students learning in terms of students' motivation, persistence, and learning outcomes. However, maintaining and supporting online learning communities is very challenging and requires tremendous work. Automatic support is desirable in this situation. The purpose of this work is to explore the use of deep learning algorithms for automatic text generation in providing emotional and community support for a massive online learning community, Scratch. Particularly, state-of-art deep learning language models GPT-2 and recurrent neural network (RNN) are trained using two million comments from the online learning community. We then conduct both a readability test and human evaluation on the automatically generated results for offering support to the online students. The results show that the GPT-2 language model can provide timely and human-written like replies in a style genuine to the data set and context for offering related support.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to using technologies to simulate human cognition to solve a specific problem. The rapid development of AI in the health sector has been attributed to the improvement of computing speed, exponential increase in data production, and routine data collection. In this paper, we review the current applications of AI for oral and maxillofacial (OMF) cosmetic surgery to provide surgeons with the fundamental technical elements needed to understand its potential. AI plays an increasingly important role in OMF cosmetic surgery in various settings, and its usage may raise ethical issues. In addition to machine learning algorithms (a subtype of AI), convolutional neural networks (a subtype of deep learning) are widely used in OMF cosmetic surgeries. Depending on their complexity, these networks can extract and process the elementary characteristics of an image. They are, therefore, commonly used in the diagnostic process for medical images and facial photos. AI algorithms have been used to assist surgeons with diagnosis, therapeutic decisions, preoperative planning, and outcome prediction and evaluation. AI algorithms complement human skills while minimizing shortcomings through their capabilities to learn, classify, predict, and detect. This algorithm should, however, be rigorously evaluated clinically, and a systematic ethical reflection should be conducted regarding data protection, diversity, and transparency. It is possible to revolutionize the practice of functional and aesthetic surgeries with 3D simulation models and AI models. Planning, decision-making, and evaluation during and after surgery can be improved with simulation systems. A surgical AI model can also perform time-consuming or challenging tasks for surgeons.

AB The ongoing explosion of interest in artificial intelligence is fueled in part by recently developed techniques in machine learning. Those techniques allow automated systems to process huge amounts of data, utilizing mathematical methods that depart from traditional statistical approaches, and resulting in impressive advancements in our ability to make predictions and uncover correlations across a host of interesting domains. But as is now widely discussed, the way that those systems arrive at their outputs is often opaque, even to the experts who design and deploy them. Is it morally problematic to make use of opaque automated methods when making high-stakes decisions, like whether to issue a loan to an applicant, or whether to approve a parole request? Many scholars answer in the affirmative. However, there is no widely accepted explanation for why transparent systems are morally preferable to opaque systems. We argue that the use of automated decision-making systems sometimes violates duties of consideration that are owed by decision-makers to decision-subjects, duties that are both epistemic and practical in character. Violations of that kind generate a weighty consideration against the use of opaque decision systems. In the course of defending our approach, we show that it is able to address three major challenges sometimes leveled against attempts to defend the moral import of transparency in automated decision-making.

AB Social media has the unique capacity to expose many learners to media literacy instruction via targeted campaigns. Investigating learner engagement and reaction to these efforts may be a fruitful endeavor for researchers that can inform the design of future campaigns. However, the massive datasets associated with social media posts are difficult, and often impossible, to analyze with traditional qualitative methods. This study seeks to address this problem by leveraging machine learning techniques to collect and analyze Big Data from two different media literacy campaigns on the youth-oriented social media platform TikTok. Specifically, we explore the ways topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and network analysis can provide insight into learner engagement with these campaigns and discuss limitations and implications for stakeholders interested in utilizing these approaches.

AB Background: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) underestimation of prostate cancer extent complicates the definition of focal treatment margins.
   Objective: To validate focal treatment margins produced by an artificial intelligence (AI) model.
   Design, setting, and participants: Testing was conducted retrospectively in an independent dataset of 50 consecutive patients who had radical prostatectomy for intermediate-risk cancer. An AI deep learning model incorporated multimodal imaging and biopsy data to produce three-dimensional cancer estimation maps and margins. AI margins were compared with conventional MRI regions of interest (ROIs), 10-mm margins around ROIs, and hemigland margins. The AI model also furnished predictions of negative surgical margin probability, which were assessed for accuracy.
   Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Comparing AI with conventional margins, sensitivity was evaluated using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and negative margin rates using chi-square tests. Predicted versus observed negative margin probability was assessed using linear regression. Clinically significant prostate cancer (International Society of Urological Pathology grade >= 2) delineated on whole-mount histopathology served as ground truth.
   Results and limitations: The mean sensitivity for cancer-bearing voxels was higher for AI margins (97%) than for conventional ROIs (37%, p < 0.001), 10-mm ROI margins (93%, p = 0.24), and hemigland margins (94%, p < 0.001). For index lesions, AI margins were more often negative (90%) than conventional ROIs (0%, p < 0.001), 10-mm ROI margins (82%, p = 0.24), and hemigland margins (66%, p = 0.004). Predicted and observed negative margin probabilities were strongly correlated (R-2 = 0.98, median error = 4%). Limitations include a validation dataset derived from a single institution's prostatectomy population.
   Conclusions: The AI model was accurate and effective in an independent test set. This approach could improve and standardize treatment margin definition, potentially reducing cancer recurrence rates. Furthermore, an accurate assessment of negative margin probability could facilitate informed decision-making for patients and physicians.
   Patient summary: Artificial intelligence was used to predict the extent of tumors in surgically removed prostate specimens. It predicted tumor margins more accurately than conventional methods. (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of European Association of Urology.

AB We propose modeling Group Support System (GSS) search tasks with Genetic Algorithms. Using explicit mathematical models for Genetic Algorithms (GAS), we show how to estimate the underlying GA parameters from an observed GSS solution path. Once these parameters are estimated, they may be related to GSS variables such as group composition and membership, leadership presence, the specific GSS tools available, incentive structure, and organizational culture. The estimated Genetic Algorithm parameters can be used with the mathematical models for GAS to compute or simulate expected GSS process outcomes.

AB Objective The purpose of this study is to assess the "real-world" impact of an artificial intelligence (AI) tool designed to detect breast cancer in digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) screening exams following 12 months of utilization in a subspecialized academic breast center. Methods Following IRB approval, mammography audit reports, as specified in the BI-RADS atlas, were retrospectively generated for five radiologists reading at three locations during a 12-month time frame. One location had the AI tool (iCAD ProFound AI v2.0), and the other two locations did not. The co-primary endpoints were cancer detection rate (CDR) and abnormal interpretation rate (AIR). Secondary endpoints included positive predictive values (PPVs) for cancer among screenings with abnormal interpretations (PPV1) and for biopsies performed (PPV3). Odds ratios (OR) with two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) summarized the impact of AI across radiologists using generalized estimating equations. Results Nonsignificant differences were observed in CDR, AIR, and PPVs. The CDR was 7.3 with AI and 5.9 without AI (OR 1.3, 95% CI: 0.9-1.7). The AIR was 11.7% with AI and 11.8% without AI (OR 1.0, 95% CI: 0.8-1.3). The PPV1 was 6.2% with AI and 5.0% without AI (OR 1.3, 95% CI: 0.97-1.7). The PPV3 was 33.3% with AI and 32.0% without AI (OR 1.1, 95% CI: 0.8-1.5). Conclusion Although we are unable to show statistically significant changes in CDR and AIR outcomes in the two groups, the results are consistent with prior reader studies. There is a nonsignificant trend toward improvement in CDR with AI, without significant increases in AIR.

AB Nanoparticles (NPs) can be designed for targeted delivery in cancer nanomedicine, but the challenge is a low delivery efficiency (DE) to the tumor site. Understanding the impact of NPs' physicochemical properties on target tissue distribution and tumor DE can help improve the design of nanomedicines. Multiple machine learning and artificial intelligence models, including linear regression, support vector machine, random forest, gradient boosting, and deep neural networks (DNN), were trained and validated to predict tissue distribution and tumor delivery based on NPs' physicochemical properties and tumor therapeutic strategies with the dataset from NanoTumor Database. Compared to other machine learning models, the DNN model had superior predictions of DE to tumors and major tissues. The determination coefficients (R2) for the test datasets were 0.41, 0.42, 0.45, 0.79, 0.87, and 0.83 for DE in tumor, heart, liver, spleen, lung, and kidney, respectively. All the R2 and root mean squared error (RMSE) results of the test datasets were similar to the 5-fold cross validation results. Feature importance analysis showed that the core material of NPs played an important role in output predictions among all physicochemical properties. Furthermore, multiple NP formulations with greater DE to the tumor were determined by the DNN model. To facilitate model applications, the final model was converted to a web dashboard. This model could serve as a high-throughput pre-screening tool to support the design of new and efficient nanomedicines with greater tumor DE and serve as an alternative tool to reduce, refine, and partially replace animal experimentation in cancer nanomedicine research.

AB OBJECTIVE: Laparoscopic surgical skill assessment and machine learning are often inaccessible to low -and -middle -income countries (LMIC). Our team developed a low-cost laparoscopic training system to teach and assess psychomotor skills required in laparoscopic salpingostomy in LMICs. We performed video review using AI to assess global surgical techniques. The objective of this study was to assess the validity of artificial intelligence (AI) generated scoring measures of laparoscopic simulation videos by comparing the accuracy of AI results to human -generated scores. DESIGN: Seventy-four surgical simulation videos were collected and graded by human participants using a modified OSATS (Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills). The videos were then analyzed via AI using 3 different time and distance -based calculations of the laparoscopic instruments including path length, dimensionless jerk, and standard deviation of tool position. Predicted scores were generated using 5 -fold cross validation and K -Nearest -Neighbors to train classifiers. SETTING: Surgical novices and experts from a variety of hospitals in Ethiopia, Cameroon, Kenya, and the United States contributed 74 laparoscopic salpingostomy simulation videos. RESULTS: Complete accuracy of AI compared to human assessment ranged from 65-77%. There were no statistical differences in rank mean scores for 3 domains, Flow of Operation, Respect for Tissue, and Economy of Motion, while there were significant differences in ratings for Instrument Handling, Overall Performance, and the total summed score of all 5 domains (Summed). Estimated effect sizes were all less than 0.11, indicating very small practical effect. Estimated intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of Summed was 0.72 indicating moderate correlation between AI and Human scores. CONCLUSIONS: Video review using AI technology of global characteristics was similar to that of human review in our laparoscopic training system. Machine learning may help fill an educational gap in LMICs where direct apprenticeship may not be feasible. ( J Surg Ed 81:267-274. (c) 2023 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

AB Accurate diagnosis of plant diseases by the assessment of pathogen presence to reduce disease-related production loss is one of the most fundamental issues for farmers and specialists. This will improve product quality, increase productivity, reduce the use of fungicides, and reduce the final cost of agricultural production. Today, new technologies such as image processing, artificial intelligence, and deep learning have provided reliable solutions in various fields of precision agriculture and smart farm management. In this research, microscopic image processing and machine learning have been used to identify the spores of four common tomato fungal diseases. A dataset including 100 microscopic images of spores for each disease was developed, followed by the extraction of the texture, color, and shape features from the images. The classification results using random forest revealed an accuracy higher than 98%. Besides, as a reliable feature selection algorithm, the butterfly optimization algorithm (BOA) was used to detect the effective image features to identify and classify diseases. This algorithm recognized image textural features as the most effective features in the diagnosis and classification of disease spores. Considering only the eight most effective features selected with BOA resulted in an accuracy of 95% in disease detection. To further investigate the performance of the proposed method, its accuracy was compared with the accuracies of convolutional neural networks and EfficientNet as two reliable deep learning algorithms. Not only the prediction accuracy of these methods was not favorable (65 and 83.55%, respectively), they were very time-consuming. According to the findings, the proposed framework has high reliability in disease diagnosis and can help in the management of tomato fungal diseases.

AB Recent advances in computing technology in terms of speed, cost, as well as access to tremendous amounts of computing power and the ability to process huge amounts of data in reasonable time has spurred increased interest in data mining applications to extract useful knowledge from data. Machine learning has been one of the methods used in most of these data mining applications. It is widely acknowledged that about 80% of the resources in a majority of data mining applications are spent on cleaning and preprocessing the data. However, there have been relatively few studies on preprocessing data used as input in these data mining systems. In this study, we evaluate several inter-class as well as probabilistic distance-based feature selection methods as to their effectiveness in preprocessing input data for inducing decision trees. We use real-world data to evaluate these feature selection methods. Results from this study show that inter-class distance measures result in better performance compared to probabilistic measures, in general. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Smart speakers' voice recognition technology has not only advanced the efficiency of communication between users and machines, but also raised users' privacy concerns. As smart speakers listen to users' voice commands and collect audio data to improve algorithms, it is crucial to understand how users manage their privacy settings to protect personal information. Combining the uses and gratifications approach, the Media Equation, and communication privacy management theory, this study surveyed 991 participants' attitudes and behavior patterns related to smart speaker use. The study explored the unique gratifications that users seek, identified the main strategies that users adopt to manage their privacy, and suggested that users apply interpersonal privacy management rules to interactions with smart media. In addition, users' gratifications affect their privacy management via two routes: a protective route that highlights the role of perceived privacy risks, and a precautionary route that emphasizes the impact of users' social presence experiences.

DE artificial intelligence; behavioral research; large language models
AB Large Language Models have been incorporated into an astounding breadth of professional domains. Given their capabilities, many intellectual laborers naturally question to what extent these AI models will be able to usurp their own jobs. As behavioral scientists, we performed an effort to examine the extent to which an AI can perform our roles. To achieve this, we utilized commercially available AIs (e.g., ChatGPT 4) to perform each step of the research process, culminating in an AI-written manuscript. We attempted to intervene as little as possible in the AI-led idea generation, empirical testing, analysis, and reporting. This allowed us to assess the limits of AIs in a behavioral research context and propose guidelines for behavioral researchers wanting to utilize AI. We found that the AIs were adept at some parts of the process and wholly inadequate at others. Our overall recommendation is that behavioral researchers use AIs judiciously and carefully monitor the outputs for quality and coherence. We additionally draw implications for editorial teams, doctoral student training, and the broader research ecosystem.

AB Using a systematic literature search of original articles published during 2023 in Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (GIE) and other high-impact medical and gastroenterology journals, the GIE Editorial Board of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy compiled a list of the top 10 most significant topic areas in general and advanced GI endoscopy during the year. Each GIE Editorial Board member was directed to consider 3 criteria in generating candidate topics-significance, novelty, and impact on global clinical practice-and subject matter consensus was facilitated by the Chair through electronic voting and a meeting of the entire GIE Editorial Board. The 10 identified areas collectively represent advances in the following endoscopic spheres: GI bleeding, endohepatology, endoscopic palliation, artificial intelligence and polyp detection, artificial intelligence beyond the colon, better polypectomy and EMR, how to make endoscopy units greener, high-quality upper endoscopy, endoscopic tissue apposition and closure devices, and endoscopic submucosal dissection. Each board member was assigned a topic area around which to summarize relevant important articles, thereby generating this overview of the "top 10" endoscopic advances of 2023.

AB Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining traction in medicine and surgery. AI-based applications can offer tools to examine high-volume data to inform predictive analytics that supports complex decision-making processes. Time-sensitive trauma and emergency contexts are often challenging. The study aims to investigate trauma and emergency surgeons' knowledge and perception of using AI-based tools in clinical decision-making processes. Methods: An online survey grounded on literature regarding AI-enabled surgical decision-making aids was created by a multidisciplinary committee and endorsed by the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES). The survey was advertised to 917 WSES members through the society's website and Twitter profile. Results: 650 surgeons from 71 countries in five continents participated in the survey. Results depict the presence of technology enthusiasts and skeptics and surgeons' preference toward more classical decision-making aids like clinical guidelines, traditional training, and the support of their multidisciplinary colleagues. A lack of knowledge about several AI-related aspects emerges and is associated with mistrust. Discussion: The trauma and emergency surgical community is divided into those who firmly believe in the potential of AI and those who do not understand or trust AI-enabled surgical decision-making aids. Academic societies and surgical training programs should promote a foundational, working knowledge of clinical AI.

AB The goal of the study was to explore the factors that explain users' trust and usage intent of the leading explainable artificial intelligence (AI) fake news detection technology. Toward this end, we examined the relationships between various human factors and software-related factors using a survey. The regression models showed that users' trust levels in the software were influenced by both individuals' inherent characteristics and their perceptions of the AI application. Users' adoption intention was ultimately influenced by trust in the detector, which explained a significant amount of the variance. We also found that trust levels were higher when users perceived the application to be highly competent at detecting fake news, be highly collaborative, and have more power in working autonomously. Our findings indicate that trust is a focal element in determining users' behavioral intentions. We argue that identifying positive heuristics of fake news detection technology is critical for facilitating the diffusion of AI-based detection systems in fact-checking.

AB Supporting learners in achieving high-level socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL) in the online collaborative learning (OCL) context presents challenges that the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies may help solve. However, the effective uses of AI to support multifaceted areas (cognition, metacognition, and motivation) and phases (forethought, performance, and reflection) of SSRL remain elusive. Furthermore, research on developing an educational AI and what pedagogical attributes and elements are required for AI to support students' SSRL effectively is limited. This study, therefore, aims to investigate students' perceptions of AI applications in enhancing SSRL and to explore the essential pedagogical elements necessary for AI to support SSRL during the OCL. To achieve these aims, the study conducted Focus Group Interviews facilitated by 9 scenarios of AI application storyboards and paper prototypes with 30 undergraduate and graduate students. The study findings show that students perceive various types of AI to support cognitive, metacognitive, and motivational areas across different SSRL phases. The study also found that students viewed AI as an active learning agent, serving in roles previously inhabited solely by human educators and students. Furthermore, the study reveals seven key pedagogical elements across TPACK components such as pedagogical, content, technological, pedagogical content, technological pedagogical, technological content, and technological pedagogical content knowledge deemed crucial by students for AI to support SSRL in OCL effectively. These findings offer implications for using and designing educationally relevant AI to support SSRL in OCL environments.

AB Introduction The continual evolution of dental education, dental practice and the delivery of optimal oral health care is rooted in the practice of leadership. This paper explores opportunities and challenges facing dental education with a specific focus on incorporating the use of artificial intelligence (AI). Methods Using the model in Bolman and Deal's Reframing Organizations, the Four Frames model serves as a road map for building infrastructure within dental schools for the adoption of AI. Conclusion AI can complement and boost human tasks and have a far-reaching impact in academia and health care. Its adoption could enhance educational experiences and the delivery of care, and support current functions and future innovation. The framework suggested in this paper, while specific to AI, could be adapted and applied to a myriad of innovations and new organizational ideals and goals within institutions of dental education.

AB Established guidelines describe minimum requirements for reporting algorithms in healthcare; it is equally important to objectify the characteristics of ideal algorithms that confer maximum potential benefits to patients, clinicians, and investigators. We propose a framework for ideal algorithms, including 6 desiderata: explainable (convey the relative importance of features in determining outputs), dynamic (capture temporal changes in physiologic signals and clinical events), precise (use high-resolution, multimodal data and aptly complex architecture), autonomous (learn with minimal supervision and execute without human input), fair (evaluate and mitigate implicit bias and social inequity), and reproducible (validated externally and prospectively and shared with academic communities). We present an ideal algorithms checklist and apply it to highly cited algorithms. Strategies and tools such as the predictive, descriptive, relevant (PDR) framework, the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials-Artificial Intelligence (SPIRIT-AI) extension, sparse regression methods, and minimizing concept drift can help healthcare algorithms achieve these objectives, toward ideal algorithms in healthcare.

AB BACKGROUND Over the past decade, several studies have shown that potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in dermatology. However, there has yet to be a systematic review evaluating the usage of AI specifically within the field of Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS). OBJECTIVE In this review, we aimed to comprehensively evaluate the current state, efficacy, and future implications of AI when applied to MMS for the treatment of nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSC). MATERIALS AND METHODS A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted following PRISMA guidelines across several databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane libraries. A predefined protocol was registered in PROSPERO, with literature search involving specific keywords related to AI and Mohs surgery for NMSC. RESULTS From 23 studies evaluated, our results find that AI shows promise as a prediction tool for precisely identifying NMSC in tissue sections during MMS. Furthermore, high AUC and concordance values were also found across the various usages of AI in MMS, including margin control, surgical recommendations, similarity metrics, and in the prediction of stage and construction complexity. CONCLUSION The findings of this review suggest promising potential for AI to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of Mohs surgery, particularly for NMSC.

AB Purpose: An estimated $1.5 billion is spent annually for direct medical expenses and an additional $2.5 billion for indirect costs for the management of prostate cancer. Today there are several procedures for staging prostate cancer, including lymph node dissection. Despite these procedures, the accuracy of predicting extracapsular disease remains low (range 37 to 63, mean 45%). Use of multiple staging procedures adds significantly to the costs of managing prostate cancer. Recently artificial intelligence based neural networks have become available for medical applications. Unlike traditional statistical methods, these networks do not assume linearity or homogeneity of variance and, thus, they are more accurate for clinical data. We applied this concept to staging localized prostate cancer and devised an algorithm that can be used for prostate cancer staging.
   Materials and Methods: Our study comprised 1,200 men with clinically organ confined prostate cancer who underwent preoperative staging using serum prostate specific antigen, systematic biopsy and Gleason scoring before radical prostatectomy and lymphadenectomy. The performance of the neural network was validated for a subset of patients and network predictions were compared with actual pathological stage. Mean patient age was 62.9 years, mean serum prostate specific antigen 8.1 ng./ml. and mean biopsy Gleason 6. Of the patients 55% had organ confined disease, 27% positive margins, 8% seminal vesicle involvement and 7% lymph node disease. Of margin positive patients 30% also had seminal vesicle involvement, while of seminal vesicle positive patients 50% also had positive margins.
   Results: The sensitivity of the network was 81 to 100%, and specificity was 72 to 75% for various predictions of margin, seminal vesicle and lymph node involvement. The negative predictive values tended to be relatively high for all 3 features (range 92 to 100%). The neural network missed only 8% of patients with margin positive disease, and 2% with lymph node and 0% with seminal vesicle involvement.
   Conclusions: Our study suggests that neural networks may be useful as an initial staging tool for detection of extracapsular extension in patients with clinically organ confined prostate cancer. These networks preclude unnecessary staging tests for 63% of patients with clinically organ confined prostate cancer.

AB Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is a burgeoning new field that has increased in popularity over the past couple of years, coinciding with the public release of large language model (LLM)-driven chatbots. These chatbots, such as ChatGPT, can be engaged directly in conversation, allowing users to ask them questions or issue other commands. Since LLMs are trained on large amounts of text data, they can also answer questions reliably and factually, an ability that has allowed them to serve as a source for medical inquiries. This study seeks to assess the readability of patient education materials on cardiac catheterization across four of the most common chatbots: ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, and Meta AI. Methodology: A set of 10 questions regarding cardiac catheterization was developed using website-based patient education materials on the topic. We then asked these questions in consecutive order to four of the most common chatbots: ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, and Meta AI. The Flesch Reading Ease Score (FRES) was used to assess the readability score. Readability grade levels were assessed using six tools: Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL), Gunning Fog Index (GFI), Coleman-Liau Index (CLI), Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) Index, Automated Readability Index (ARI), and FORCAST Grade Level. Results: The mean FRES across all four chatbots was 40.2, while overall mean grade levels for the four chatbots were 11.2, 13.7, 13.7, 13.3, 11.2, and 11.6 across the FKGL, GFI, CLI, SMOG, ARI, and FORCAST indices, respectively. Mean reading grade levels across the six tools were 14.8 for ChatGPT, 12.3 for Microsoft Copilot, 13.1 for Google Gemini, and 9.6 for Meta AI. Further, FRES values for the four chatbots were 31, 35.8, 36.4, and 57.7, respectively. Conclusions: This study shows that AI chatbots are capable of providing answers to medical questions regarding cardiac catheterization. However, the responses across the four chatbots had overall mean reading grade levels at the 11th th-13th th-grade level, depending on the tool used. This means that the materials were at the high school and even college reading level, which far exceeds the recommended sixth-grade level for patient education materials. Further, there is significant variability in the readability levels provided by different chatbots as, across all six grade-level assessments, Meta AI had the lowest scores and ChatGPT generally had the highest.

ID ASSOCIATION
AB The recent development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, especially the advance of deep neural network (DNN) technology, has revolutionized many fields. While DNN plays a central role in modern AI technology, it has rarely been used in genetic data analysis due to analytical and computational challenges brought by high-dimensional genetic data and an increasing number of samples. To facilitate the use of AI in genetic data analysis, we developed a C ++ package, AIGen, based on two newly developed neural networks (i.e. kernel neural networks and functional neural networks) that are capable of modeling complex genotype-phenotype relationships (e.g. interactions) while providing robust performance against high-dimensional genetic data. Moreover, computationally efficient algorithms (e.g. a minimum norm quadratic unbiased estimation approach and batch training) are implemented in the package to accelerate the computation, making them computationally efficient for analyzing large-scale datasets with thousands or even millions of samples. By applying AIGen to the UK Biobank dataset, we demonstrate that it can efficiently analyze large-scale genetic data, attain improved accuracy, and maintain robust performance. Availability: AIGen is developed in C ++ and its source code, along with reference libraries, is publicly accessible on GitHub at https://github.com/TingtHou/AIGen.

AB Reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is one of the most important factors in the hydrologic cycle and water balance studies. In this study, the performance of three simple and three wavelet hybrid models were compared to estimate ETo in three different climates in Iran, based on different combinations of input variables. It was found that the wavelet-artificial neural network was the best model, and multiple linear regression (MLR) was the worst model in most cases, although the performance of the models was related to the climate and the input variables used for modeling. Overall, it was found that all models had good accuracy in terms of estimating daily ETo. Also, it was found in this study that large numbers of decomposition levels via the wavelet transform had noticeable negative effects on the performance of the wavelet-based models, especially for the wavelet-adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system and wavelet-MLR, but in contrast, the type of db wavelet function did not have a detectable effect on the performance of the wavelet-based models.

AB This study captured the perspectives of 887 working adults to explore views of professionalism, authenticity, and effectiveness of AI-generated messages. With a 3 (message type) x 2 (disclosed vs. undisclosed) x 2 (ChatGPT-generated vs. Google-generated AI messages) design, professionals generally view AI-generated content favorably in all conditions. Across all messages, professionals consistently rated the AI-generated messages as professional, effective, efficient, confident, and direct. They rate sincerity and caring slightly lower in some disclosed conditions, particularly for ChatGPT-generated messages, suggesting the importance of tool selection when using generative AI for workplace writing. Those professionals who use AI more frequently for work are more likely to view AI-assisted writing as authentic, effective, and confidence-building. Implications for teaching business communication, including the need to address AI literacy, and suggestions for future research are provided.

TI DO AIS DREAM OF ELECTRIC BOARDS?

LA English
DT Article
ID CORPORATE; LIABILITY; LAW
AB When artificial intelligence (AI) acquires self-awareness, agency, and unique intelligence, it will attain ontological personhood. Management of firms by AI would be technologically and economically feasible. The law could confer upon AI the status of legal personhood, as it did upon traditional business firms in the past, thus dispensing with the need for inserting AI as property within the legal boundary of a firm. As a separate and distinct entity, AI could function independently as a manager in the way that legal or natural persons do today: i.e., AI as director, officer, partner, member, or manager. Such a future is desirable only if AI as manager creates more value than AI as tool or android serf. The principle of legal personhood is not intrinsically incompatible with the idea of machine person. This Article explores the legal, policy, and economic questions: Could we confer legal personhood on AI? Should we? This Article answers that the idea of AI as manager, qua legal person, is compelling. Economic and legal theories suggest that the conferral of AI personhood, permitting AI as manager, would create more value. With respect to law and policy, current laws of business firms suffice to provide the essential framework for the future. They mandate that corporate managers must be natural persons, but permit managers of noncorporate firms to be legal persons. This dichotomy provides the appropriate conceptual compromise. The use of AI as manager should be limited to private and noncorporate firms. This compromise, coupled with the limiting conditions identified in this Article, reflects the balances of cost and benefit as well as risk and value. Corporations have always been more consequential enterprises, and permitting AIto serve as corporate officers or directors could impose greater social and economic externalities. Legal personhood of AI would usher in a brave new world, which should be welcomed in the spirit of innovation-but the law should ensure a stable old world.

AB Psoriasis, a chronic inflammatory skin condition affecting millions globally, is challenging to diagnose and manage due to reliance on visual inspection and subjective assessments. This warrants the need for objective, data-driven methods. Emerging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies offer promising solutions across various aspects of psoriasis care. This review explores the prevalence and challenges of psoriasis, the limitations of traditional diagnostic methods, and the applications of AI in psoriasis identification, classification, lesion segmentation, and personalized treatment planning. It provides a critical analysis of recent advancements, highlights unaddressed gaps, and outlines future research directions to enhance the role of AI in psoriasis management. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using targeted keywords on open-access databases, focusing on studies published in English from 2015 to 2024. Relevant original research on AI applications in psoriasis management, including diagnosis, classification, lesion segmentation, and treatment recommendations, was critically analyzed to identify advancements, gaps, and opportunities for improving patient outcomes. Findings of this review indicate that AI technologies enhanced diagnostic accuracy and treatment personalization. However, significant gaps remain in their integration into clinical practice and assessments of long-term efficacy. In contrast to previous review articles, this work covered a wider range of recent studies, identified critical gaps that have not been adequately addressed, and outlined future research directions for enhancing the role of AI in improving psoriasis management. This work serves as a valuable resource for researchers, clinicians, and technology developers, emphasizing the need for further exploration of the potential of AI to improve patient outcomes in psoriasis.

AB Objective: To conduct a systematic scoping review of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) models that use real-world electronic health record data, categorize these techniques according to different biomedical applications, identify gaps of current studies, and suggest future research directions.
   Materials and Methods: We searched MEDLINE, IEEE Xplore, and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library to identify relevant papers published between January 1, 2009 and May 1, 2019. We summarized these studies based on the year of publication, prediction tasks, machine learning algorithm, dataset(s) used to build the models, the scope, category, and evaluation of the XAI methods. We further assessed the reproducibility of the studies in terms of the availability of data and code and discussed open issues and challenges.
   Results: Forty-two articles were included in this review. We reported the research trend and most-studied diseases. We grouped XAI methods into 5 categories: knowledge distillation and rule extraction (N=13), intrinsically interpretable models (N=9), data dimensionality reduction (N=8), attention mechanism (N=7), and feature interaction and importance (N=5).
   Discussion: XAI evaluation is an open issue that requires a deeper focus in the case of medical applications. We also discuss the importance of reproducibility of research work in this field, as well as the challenges and opportunities of XAI from 2 medical professionals' point of view.
   Conclusion: Based on our review, we found that XAI evaluation in medicine has not been adequately and formally practiced. Reproducibility remains a critical concern. Ample opportunities exist to advance XAI research in medicine.

AB Simple Summary Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is commonly treated using high-dose radiotherapy. Careful radiotherapy planning is crucial for the eradication of cancer cells while avoiding injuries to normal structures. This balance is often delicate given the complex anatomic location in which NPC is situated. This article highlights the considerations, practical pearls, and recent advances in the precise delivery of radiotherapy in NPC patients. Radiotherapy is the primary treatment modality for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Successful curative treatment requires optimal radiotherapy planning and precise beam delivery that maximizes locoregional control while minimizing treatment-related side effects. In this article, we highlight considerations in target delineation, radiation dose, and the adoption of technological advances with the aim of optimizing the benefits of radiotherapy in NPC patients.

AB Objective Our objective is to develop and validate TrajVis, an interactive tool that assists clinicians in using artificial intelligence (AI) models to leverage patients' longitudinal electronic medical records (EMRs) for personalized precision management of chronic disease progression.Materials and Methods We first perform requirement analysis with clinicians and data scientists to determine the visual analytics tasks of the TrajVis system as well as its design and functionalities. A graph AI model for chronic kidney disease (CKD) trajectory inference named DisEase PrOgression Trajectory (DEPOT) is used for system development and demonstration. TrajVis is implemented as a full-stack web application with synthetic EMR data derived from the Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Translational Data Warehouse and the Indiana Network for Patient Care research database. A case study with a nephrologist and a user experience survey of clinicians and data scientists are conducted to evaluate the TrajVis system.Results The TrajVis clinical information system is composed of 4 panels: the Patient View for demographic and clinical information, the Trajectory View to visualize the DEPOT-derived CKD trajectories in latent space, the Clinical Indicator View to elucidate longitudinal patterns of clinical features and interpret DEPOT predictions, and the Analysis View to demonstrate personal CKD progression trajectories. System evaluations suggest that TrajVis supports clinicians in summarizing clinical data, identifying individualized risk predictors, and visualizing patient disease progression trajectories, overcoming the barriers of AI implementation in healthcare.Discussion The TrajVis system provides a novel visualization solution which is complimentary to other risk estimators such as the Kidney Failure Risk Equations.Conclusion TrajVis bridges the gap between the fast-growing AI/ML modeling and the clinical use of such models for personalized and precision management of chronic diseases.

ID SURVIVAL BENEFIT
AB BackgroundThe principles of urgency, utility, and benefit are fundamental concepts guiding the ethical and practical decision-making process for organ allocation; however, LT allocation still follows an urgency model.AimTo identify and analyze data elements used in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods, data sources, and their focus on urgency, utility, or benefit in LT.MethodsA comprehensive search across Ovid Medline and Scopus was conducted for studies published from 2002 to June 2023. Inclusion criteria targeted quantitative studies using ML/AI for candidates, donors, or recipients. Two reviewers assessed eligibility and extracted data, following PRISMA guidelines.ResultsA total of 20 papers were included, synthesizing results into five major categories. Eight studies were led by a Spanish team, focusing on donor-recipient matching and proposing machine learning models to predict post- LT survival. Other international studies addressed organ supply-demand issues and developed predictive models to optimize LT outcomes. The studies highlight the potential of ML/AI to enhance LT allocation and outcomes. Despite advancements, limitations included the lack of robust transplant-related benefit models and improvements in urgency models compared to MELD.DiscussionThis review highlighted the potential of AI and ML to enhance liver transplant allocation and outcomes. Significant advancements were noted, but limitations such as the need for better urgency models and the absence of a transplant-related benefit model remain. Most studies emphasized utility, focusing on survival outcomes. Future research should address the interpretability and generalizability of these models to improve organ allocation and post-LT survival predictions.

AB Synopsis Despite efforts to integrate research across different subdisciplines of biology, the scale of integration remains limited. We hypothesize that future generations of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies specifically adapted for biological sciences will help enable the reintegration of biology. AI technologies will allow us not only to collect, connect, and analyze data at unprecedented scales, but also to build comprehensive predictive models that span various subdisciplines. They will make possible both targeted (testing specific hypotheses) and untargeted discoveries. AI for biology will be the cross-cutting technology that will enhance our ability to do biological research at every scale. We expect AI to revolutionize biology in the 21st century much like statistics transformed biology in the 20th century. The difficulties, however, are many, including data curation and assembly, development of new science in the form of theories that connect the subdisciplines, and new predictive and interpretable AI models that are more suited to biology than existing machine learning and AI techniques. Development efforts will require strong collaborations between biological and computational scientists. This white paper provides a vision for AI for Biology and highlights some challenges.

AB Ambient Intelligence (AmI) is a new paradigm in information technology aimed at empowering people's capabilities by means of digital environments that are sensitive, adaptive, and responsive to human needs, habits, gestures, and emotions. This futuristic vision of daily environment will enable innovative human-machine interactions characterized by pervasive, unobtrusive, and anticipatory communications. Such innovative interaction paradigms make AmI technology a suitable candidate for developing various real life solutions, including in the healthcare domain. This survey will discuss the emergence of AmI techniques in the healthcare domain, in order to provide the research community with the necessary background. We will examine the infrastructure and technology required for achieving the vision of AmI, such as smart environments and wearable medical devices. We will summarize the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies used for developing AmI system in the healthcare domain, including various learning techniques (for learning from user interaction), reasoning techniques (for reasoning about users' goals and intensions), and planning techniques (for planning activities and interactions). We will also discuss how AmI technology might support people affected by various physical or mental disabilities or chronic disease. Finally, we will point to some of the successful case studies in the area and we will look at the current and future challenges to draw upon the possible future research paths.

ID SOCIETY; GUIDELINES
AB Introduction: Our objective was to test the ability of ChatGPT 4.0 to provide accurate information for patients and physicians about abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) and to assess its alignment with Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) clinical practice guidelines (CPG) for AAA care. Material and methods: Fifteen patient-level questions, 37 questions selected to reflect 28 SVS CPGs and 4 questions regarding AAA rupture risk were posed to ChatGPT 4.0. Single responses were recorded and graded for accuracy and quality by ten board-certified vascular surgeons as well as two fellow trainees using a 5-point Likert scale; 1 = very poor, 2 = poor, 3 = fair, 4 = good, and 5 = excellent. Results: The mean of the means (MoM) accuracy rating across all 15 patient-level questions was 4.4 (SD 0.4, quartile range (QR) 4.2-4.7). ChatGPT 4.0 demonstrated good alignment with SVS practice guidelines (MoM: 4.2, SD: 0.4, QR: 3.9-4.5). The accuracy of responses was consistent across guideline categories; screening or surveillance (4.2), indications for surgery (4.5), preoperative risk assessment (4.5), perioperative coronary revascularization (4.1), and perioperative management (4.2). The generative artificial intelligence bot demonstrated only fair performance in answering the annual AAA rupture risk (MoM: 3.4, SD: 1.2, QR: 2.3-4.3). Conclusions: ChatGPT 4.0 provided accurate responses to a variety of patient-level questions regarding AAA. Responses were well-aligned with current SVS CPGs except for inaccuracies in the risk of AAA rupture at varying diameters. The emergence of generative artificial intelligence bots presents an opportunity for study of applications in patient education and to determine their ability to augment the vascular specialist's knowledge base.

TI Artificial intelligence in sleep medicine: an American Academy of Sleep
   Medicine position statement
SO JOURNAL OF CLINICAL SLEEP MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Sleep medicine is well positioned to benefit from advances that use big data to create artificially intelligent computer programs. One obvious initial application in the sleep disorders center is the assisted (or enhanced) scoring of sleep and associated events during polysomnography (PSG). This position statement outlines the potential opportunities and limitations of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into the practice of sleep medicine. Additionally, although the most apparent and immediate application of AI in ourfield is the assisted scoring of PSG, we propose potential clinical use cases that transcend the sleep laboratory and are expected to deepen our understanding of sleep disorders, improve patient-centered sleep care, augment day-to-day clinical operations, and increase our knowledge of the role of sleep in health at a population level.

TI Electronic Health Record Data Quality and Performance Assessments:
   Scoping Review
SO JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS
LA English
DT Review
ID RULES; TOOL
AB Background: Electronic health records (EHRs) have an enormous potential to advance medical research and practice through easily accessible and interpretable EHR-derived databases. Attainability of this potential is limited by issues with data quality (DQ) and performance assessment. Objective: This review aims to streamline the current best practices on EHR DQ and performance assessments as a replicable standard for researchers in the field. Methods: PubMed was systematically searched for original research articles assessing EHR DQ and performance from inception until May 7, 2023. Results: Our search yielded 26 original research articles. Most articles had 1 or more significant limitations, including incomplete or inconsistent reporting (n=6, 30%), poor replicability (n=5, 25%), and limited generalizability of results (n=5, 25%). Completeness (n=21, 81%), conformance (n=18, 69%), and plausibility (n=16, 62%) were the most cited indicators of DQ, while correctness or accuracy (n=14, 54%) was most cited for data performance, with context-specific supplementation by recency (n=7, 27%), fairness (n=6, 23%), stability (n=4, 15%), and shareability (n=2, 8%) assessments. Artificial intelligence-based techniques, including natural language data extraction, data imputation, and fairness algorithms, were demonstrated to play a rising role in improving both dataset quality and performance. Conclusions: This review highlights the need for incentivizing DQ and performance assessments and their standardization. The results suggest the usefulness of artificial intelligence-based techniques for enhancing DQ and performance to unlock the full potential of EHRs to improve medical research and practice.

AB The Banff Digital Pathology Working Group (DPWG) was established with the goal to establish a digital pathology repository; develop, validate, and share models for image analysis; and foster collaborations using regular videoconferencing. During the calls, a variety of artificial intelligence (AI)-based support systems for transplantation pathology were presented. Potential collaborations in a competition/trial on AI applied to kidney transplant specimens, including the DIAGGRAFT challenge (staining of biopsies at multiple institutions, pathologists' visual assessment, and development and validation of new and pre-existing Banff scoring algorithms), were also discussed. To determine the next steps, a survey was conducted, primarily focusing on the feasibility of establishing a digital pathology repository and identifying potential hosts. Sixteen of the 35 respondents (46%) had access to a server hosting a digital pathology repository, with 2 respondents that could serve as a potential host at no cost to the DPWG. The 16 digital pathology repositories collected specimens from various organs, with the largest constituent being kidney (n = 12,870 specimens). A DPWG pilot digital pathology repository was established, and there are plans for a competition/trial with the DIAGGRAFT project. Utilizing existing resources and previously established models, the Banff DPWG is establishing new resources for the Banff community.

AB This study is among the first to develop different prototypes of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) chatbots powered by GPT-4 to communicate hurricane preparedness information to diverse residents. Drawing from the Computers Are Social Actors paradigm and the literature on disaster vulnerability and cultural tailoring, we conducted a between-subjects experiment with 441 Black, Hispanic, and Caucasian residents of Florida. Our results suggest that GenAI chatbots varying in tone formality and cultural tailoring significantly influence perceptions of their friendliness and credibility, which, in turn, relate to hurricane preparedness outcomes. These results highlight the potential of using GenAI chatbots to improve diverse communities' disaster preparedness.
   This study looks at how generative artificial intelligence (genAI) chatbots help individuals from different racial groups prepare for hurricanes in Florida. We create and test GPT-4 chatbots that use different tones and tailor their messages to fit people's cultural backgrounds. Our results show that chatbots with an informal tone are seen as more friendly, whereas those with either a formal tone or one that fits people's cultural backgrounds are seen as more credible. Credible chatbots encourage people to seek, share, and act on disaster information. Overall, GenAI chatbots can create human-like and culturally-sensitive disaster communication for diverse communities.

AB The construction industry is integrating robots into critical tasks at an accelerated pace, with the aim of enhancing efficiency, safety, and productivity. However, construction tasks requiring dexterity remain a challenge due to the need for precise movements, accurate perception, real-time decision-making, and a comprehensive understanding of the environment. To address these challenges, the introduction of embodied artificial intelligence (AI) represents a significant shift in robotic capabilities to enhance their alignment with the broader spectrum of construction settings. Rooted in cognitive science, embodied AI emphasizes the integration of an agent's physical form into its computational intelligence processes. It resembles how humans develop motor skills by interacting with physical world. This paper introduces DEXBOT, an exploratory framework for designing construction robots capable of high dexterity using embodied AI principles that mimics human strategies in complex tasks. The framework outlines six key perspectives for solving high-dexterity tasks with embodied AI: scene understanding, localization and motion planning, position-based control, force-based control, sequence planning, and correction decision-making. By presenting preliminary test cases for each perspective, the paper emphasizes the role of embodied AI in advancing dexterity level of construction robots. The DEXBOT framework is expected to encourage interdisciplinary collaboration of designing capable construction robots in the future.

AB In recent years, many neuroimaging studies have applied artificial intelligence (AI) to facilitate existing challenges in Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosis, prognosis, and intervention. The aim of this systematic review was to provide an overview of neuroimaging-based AI studies and to assess their methodological quality. A PubMed search yielded 810 studies, of which 244 that investigated the utility of neuroimaging-based AI for PD diagnosis, prognosis, or intervention were included. We systematically categorized studies by outcomes and rated them with respect to five minimal quality criteria (MQC) pertaining to data splitting, data leakage, model complexity, performance reporting, and indication of biological plausibility. We found that the majority of studies aimed to distinguish PD patients from healthy controls (54%) or atypical parkinsonian syndromes (25%), whereas prognostic or interventional studies were sparse. Only 20% of evaluated studies passed all five MQC, with data leakage, non-minimal model complexity, and reporting of biological plausibility as the primary factors for quality loss. Data leakage was associated with a significant inflation of accuracies. Very few studies employed external test sets (8%), where accuracy was significantly lower, and 19% of studies did not account for data imbalance. Adherence to MQC was low across all observed years and journal impact factors. This review outlines that AI has been applied to a wide variety of research questions pertaining to PD; however, the number of studies failing to pass the MQC is alarming. Therefore, we provide recommendations to enhance the interpretability, generalizability, and clinical utility of future AI applications using neuroimaging in PD. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) and related technologies are transforming many consumption activities, powering breakthroughs that expand the human experience by enhancing human capabilities, performance, and creativity. While this explains the consumer enthusiasm and rapid adoption of these technologies, AI systems can also have the opposite effect: reducing and constraining the range of experiences that are available to consumers. This article examines the mechanisms through which AI can constrain the human experience, considering individual, interpersonal, and societal processes. Our analysis uncovers a complex interplay between the advantages of AI and its inadvertent negative repercussions, which potentially restrict human autonomy, self-identity, relational dynamics, and social behavior. In this article, we propose three different mechanisms at the core of these constraining forces: parametric reductionism, agency transference, and regulated expression. Our exploration of these mechanisms highlights the risks connected to system design and points to questions and implications for future researchers and policymakers.

AB Surface blemishes of various apple varieties were analyzed by their reflectance characteristics between 460 and 1130 nm. Normalized reflectance data were collected at 10 nm increments with liquid crystal tunable filters. Data were utilized as input values for various pattern recognition models specifically multi-layer back propagation, unimodal Gaussian, K-nearest neighbor and nearest cluster algorithms. Partitioning data into 50:50 training and test sets, correct classification in separating unflawed versus blemished areas ranged from 62 to 96% (Year I) and from 73 to 85% (Year II). The algorithm which yielded the highest correct classification was the multi-layer back propagation but minor variation was found for number of hidden nodes or neural net architecture.

AB ObjectivesThe aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of machine learning regression models in predicting the final color of leucite-reinforced glass CAD/CAM ceramic veneer restorations based on substrate shade, ceramic shade, thickness and translucency. MethodsLeucite-reinforced glass ceramics in four different shades were sectioned in thicknesses of 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 1.2 mm. The CIELab coordinates of each specimen were obtained over four different backgrounds (black, white, A1, and A3) interposed with an experimental translucent resin cement using a calibrated spectrophotometer. The color change (CIEDE2000) values, as well as all the CIELab values for each one of the experimental groups, were submitted to 28 different regression models. Each regression model was adjusted according to the weights of each dependent variable to achieve the best-fitting model. ResultsDifferent substrates, ceramic shades, and thicknesses influenced the L, a, and b of the final restoration. Of all variables, the substrate influenced the final ceramic shade most, followed by the ceramic thickness and the L, a, and b of the ceramic. The decision tree regression model had the lowest mean absolute error and highest accuracy to predict the shade of the ceramic restoration according to the substrate shade, ceramic shade and thickness. Clinical SignificanceThe machine learning regression model developed in the study can help clinicians predict the final color of the ceramic veneers made with leucite-reinforced glass CAD/CAM ceramic HT and LT when cemented with translucent cements, based on the color of the substrate and ceramic thicknesses.

Artificial intelligence-based clinical decision support tools within the EHR, such as ChatGPT, can provide care plan recommendations to the perinatal nurse. The lack of explicit methodologies for effectively integrating ChatGPT led to our initiative to build and demonstrate our ChatGPT-4 prompt to support nurse care planning. Methods: We employed our process model, previously tested with 22 diverse medical-surgical patient scenarios, to generate a tailored prompt for ChatGPT-4 to produce care plan suggestions for an exemplar patient presenting with preterm labor and gestational diabetes. A comparative analysis was conducted by evaluating the output against a "nurse-generated care plan" developed by our team of nurses on content alignment, accuracy of standardized nursing terminology, and prioritization of care. Results: ChatGPT-4 delivered suggestions for nursing diagnoses, interventions, and outcomes comparable to the "nurse-generated care plan." It accurately identified major care areas, avoided irrelevant or unnecessary recommendations, and identified top priority care. Of the 24 labels generated by ChatGPT-4, 16 correctly utilized standardized nursing terminology. Conclusion: This demonstration of the use of our ChatGPT-4 prompt illustrates the potential of leveraging a large language model to assist perinatal nurses in creating care plans. The next steps are improving the accuracy of ChatGPT-4-generated standardized nursing terminology and integrating our prompt into EHRs. This work supports our broader goal of enhancing patient outcomes while mitigating the burden of documentation that contributes to nurse burnout.

AB Retrieving queried information from building information models (BIM) requires experience in structured query languages and manipulation of BIM software. Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based spoken dialogue systems provide more opportunities for information retrieval from building information models via natural language queries. This research developed a transfer learning-based text classification (TC) method to classify different queries into predefined categories for an intelligent building information spoken dialogue system (iBISDS), a virtual assistant that provides information retrieval support for construction project team members. The architecture of the TC neural network (NN) was built based on the pre-trained Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa). After the training process, the re-trained and fine-tuned RoBERTa NN achieved a precision of 99.76%, a recall of 99.76%, and an F1 score of 99.76% on the testing dataset. The experimental results indicated that the developed NN algorithm for TC can relatively accurately classify different building information-related queries into pre-defined TC categories.

AB Polysomnography remains the cornerstone of objective testing in sleep medicine and results in massive amounts of electrophysiological data, which is well-suited for analysis with artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools. Combined with other sources of health data, AI is expected to provide new insights to inform the clinical care of sleep disorders and advance our understanding of the integral role sleep plays in human health. Additionally, AI has the potential to streamline day-to-day operations and therefore optimize direct patient care by the sleep disorders team. However, clinicians, scientists, and other stakeholders must develop best practices to integrate this rapidly evolving technology into our daily work while maintaining the highest degree of quality and transparency in health care and research. Ultimately, when harnessed appropriately in conjunction with human expertise, AI will improve the practice of sleep medicine and further sleep science for the health and well-being of our patients.

AB This study investigates how online users from domestic and international audiences authenticate social media influencers (SMIs) that contribute to building a destination's organic image through creative content about the destination's culture, traditions, heritage, and the life of its ordinary people. The context of the study is a popular Chinese influencer, Li Ziqi, whose videography depicts domestic, day-to-day life in rural areas of the Sichuan province of China. We use an approach that combines the Large Language Model (LLM) prompt engineering with theoretically guided human interpretations of authentication aspects such as genuineness, otherizing, traditionalizing, nostalgia, and existential authenticity. We obtained evidence that authentication through otherizing and existential authenticity, specifically self-reflection and self-discovery, is more prevalent among international followers, while domestic viewers use traditionalizing and nostalgia more. Destination Marketing Organizations (DMOs) can potentially leverage those differences in perceptions in their marketing communications with respective audiences.

AB The Computers are Social Actors (CASA) paradigm was proposed more than two decades ago to understand humans' interaction with computer technologies. Today, as emerging technologies like social robots become more personal and persuasive, questions of how users respond to them socially, what individual factors leverage the relationship, and what constitutes the social influence of these technologies need to be addressed. A lab experiment was conducted to examine the interactions between individual differences and social robots' vocal and kinetic cues. Results suggested that users developed more trust in a social robot with a human voice than with a synthetic voice. Users also developed more intimacy and interest in the social robot when it was paired with humanlike gestures. Moreover, individual differences including users' gender, attitudes toward robots, and robot exposure affected their psychological responses. The theoretical, practical, and ethical value of the findings was further discussed in the study.

AB The Mexican institute of Water Technology (IMTA) developed a highly interactive computational system for the distribution and management of water, SICODE. This software suggests alternatives and provides criteria for the management of the irrigation systems and makes the manager's task of delivering water in the volume and opportunity desired, easier. It includes a module which computes real time irrigation using an automated weather station; a soil water balance module, and a Geographic Information System (GIS), that displays the entire irrigation system and its subdivisions, crops and zones of interest. A biological simulation program is also included. SICODE introduces a new approach to incorporating artificial intelligence by means of an expert system that uses soil water balance data to assist in management decision -making to assign irrigation priorities to crops. The software is being validated in the irrigation district at Delicias, Chihuahua. SICODE can be implemented at any site for which the necessary information is available.

AB Aim: The aim of this study is to present the possibilities of nurse education in the use of the Chat Generative Pretraining Transformer (ChatGPT) tool to support the documentation process. Background: The success of the nursing process is based on the accuracy of nursing diagnoses, which also determine nursing interventions and nursing outcomes. Educating nurses in the use of artificial intelligence in the nursing process can significantly reduce the time nurses spend on documentation. Design: Discussion paper. Methods: We used a case study from Train4Health in the field of preventive care to demonstrate the potential of using Generative Pre -training Transformer (ChatGPT) to educate nurses in documenting the nursing process using generative artificial intelligence. Based on the case study, we entered a description of the patient's condition into Generative Pre -training Transformer (ChatGPT) and asked questions about nursing diagnoses, nursing interventions and nursing outcomes. We further synthesized these results. Results: In the process of educating nurses about the nursing process and nursing diagnosis, Generative Pretraining Transformer (ChatGPT) can present potential patient problems to nurses and guide them through the process from taking a medical history, setting nursing diagnoses and planning goals and interventions. Generative Pre -training Transformer (ChatGPT) returned appropriate nursing diagnoses, but these were not in line with the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association - International (NANDA-I) classification as requested. Of all the nursing diagnoses provided, only one was consistent with the most recent version of the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association - International (NANDA-I). Generative Pre -training Transformer (ChatGPT) is still not specific enough for nursing diagnoses, resulting in incorrect answers in several cases. Conclusions: Using Generative Pre -training Transformer (ChatGPT) to educate nurses and support the documentation process is time -efficient, but it still requires a certain level of human critical -thinking and factchecking.

AB Genetic algorithms (GAs) are routinely used to search problem spaces of interest. A lesser known but growing group of applications of GAs is the modeling of so-called "evolutionary processes", for example, organizational learning and group decision-making. Given such an application, we show it is possible to compute the likely GA parameter settings given observed populations of such an evolutionary process. We examine the parameter estimation process using estimation procedures for learning hidden Markov models, with mathematical models that exactly capture expected GA behavior. We then explore the sampling distributions relevant to this estimation problem using an experimental approach. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives We conducted an implementation planning process during the pilot phase of a pragmatic trial, which tests an intervention guided by artificial intelligence (AI) analytics sourced from noninvasive monitoring data in heart failure patients (LINK-HF2).Materials and methods A mixed-method analysis was conducted at 2 pilot sites. Interviews were conducted with 12 of 27 enrolled patients and with 13 participating clinicians. iPARIHS constructs were used for interview construction to identify workflow, communication patterns, and clinician's beliefs. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using inductive coding protocols to identify key themes. Behavioral response data from the AI-generated notifications were collected.Results Clinicians responded to notifications within 24 hours in 95% of instances, with 26.7% resulting in clinical action. Four implementation themes emerged: (1) High anticipatory expectations for reliable patient communications, reduced patient burden, and less proactive provider monitoring. (2) The AI notifications required a differential and tailored balance of trust and action advice related to role. (3) Clinic experience with other home-based programs influenced utilization. (4) Responding to notifications involved significant effort, including electronic health record (EHR) review, patient contact, and consultation with other clinicians.Discussion Clinician's use of AI data is a function of beliefs regarding the trustworthiness and usefulness of the data, the degree of autonomy in professional roles, and the cognitive effort involved.Conclusion The implementation planning analysis guided development of strategies that addressed communication technology, patient education, and EHR integration to reduce clinician and patient burden in the subsequent main randomized phase of the trial. Our results provide important insights into the unique implications of implementing AI analytics into clinical workflow.

AB Models that are constructed within the bounds of a single paradigm are not sufficient for modeling all aspects of complex systems.  Therefore, even though reasoning and simulation systems that utilize a single modeling paradigm are the current norm, we explore a multimodel approach in this paper.  A multimodel approach is defined as one in which more than one model - each derived from a different perspective, and utilizing correspondingly distinct reasoning and simulation strategies - are employed.  By describing four models which illustrate the use of different modeling techniques, we show how a multimodel approach can enrich the modeling environment and make it correspond better with real world information.  Our models come from many sources - Systems and Simulation literature for the modeling of natural phenomena and artificial devices, and Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science for the modeling of human intuition and expertise in reasoning.  Generalizing from these four models, we suggest that modeling complex systems may best be approached from an integrated architectural viewpoint which combines multiple modeling paradigms.

TI The Use of AI Powered ChatGPT for Nursing Education
SO JOURNAL OF NURSING EDUCATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: In late 2022, an AI (artificial intelligence) application, ChatGPT (generative pre-trained transformer), was released free for public use. Although present use of AI applications are scant in nursing education, the easy access to ChatGPT will inevitably influence educational experiences for both educators and students. Nursing educators have an opportunity to leverage this new technology by understanding the functionality and limitations of ChatGPT. Method: This article examines the framework and functionality of ChatGPT and considers a potential nursing education assignment using the AI powered ChatGPT. The AI application, ChatGPT, is reviewed within the context of health care and nursing education and a potential nursing assignment leveraging ChatGPT is considered. Results: Nursing educators will increase their knowledge about ChatGPT and consider a possible nursing curriculum assignment using ChatGPT. Conclusion: Although not without limitations, nursing educators can leverage this new AI powered technology for an enhanced student experience. [ J Nurs Educ. . 2024;63(8):564-567.]

AB Gold standard genomic datasets severely under-represent non-European populations, leading to inequities and a limited understanding of human disease. Therapeutics and outcomes remain hidden because we lack insights that could be gained from analyzing ancestrally diverse genomic data. To address this significant gap, we present PhyloFrame, a machine learning method for equitable genomic precision medicine. PhyloFrame corrects for ancestral bias by integrating functional interaction networks and population genomics data with transcriptomic training data. Application of PhyloFrame to breast, thyroid, and uterine cancers shows marked improvements in predictive power across all ancestries, less model overfitting, and a higher likelihood of identifying known cancer-related genes. Validation in fourteen ancestrally diverse datasets demonstrates that PhyloFrame is better able to adjust for ancestry bias across all populations. The ability to provide accurate predictions for underrepresented groups, in particular, is substantially increased. Analysis of performance in the most diverse continental ancestry group, African, illustrates how phylogenetic distance from training data negatively impacts model performance, as well as PhyloFrame's capacity to mitigate these effects. These results demonstrate how equitable artificial intelligence (AI) approaches can mitigate ancestral bias in training data and contribute to equitable representation in medical research.

AB Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common complication of very premature birth, leading not only to lifelong respiratory complications, but also to developmental impairment. While the impact of adequate postnatal growth in mitigating complications of premature birth is well documented, meeting the nutritional needs of premature infants with variable demands that change rapidly with the disease state remains challenging for neonatologists. In the absence of effective treatments, the focus of research in BPD is on preventative strategies addressing ventilation approach, fluid and nutritional support and limiting inflammation. The studies of nutritional support for babies with established BPD are scarce. This paper addresses nutrition preventative strategies, established BPD nutritional needs and the emerging role of artificial intelligence in individualising the nutritional approach for these infants.

AB This paper assesses the media industry in the US by analyzing Big Tech's entrance into film and television production and the rise of streaming distribution technology. Through a case study of Prime Video, Amazon's prize streaming platform, this study explores how streaming technology has disrupted film and television from multiple perspectives, subjecting the industry to new logics of internet distribution, rooted in platforms, artificial intelligence, digital delivery systems, and big data. In the Big Tech worldview, disruption is an inherently progressive development. However, an analysis of Prime Video reveals how disruption is only the latest manifestation of conglomeration and convergence in the film and television industries. By uncovering the industry logics that govern the era of streaming, this paper analyzes the streaming industry of the present while taking into consideration the cable period in the past to account for the rapid technological development in the future.

ID AUTOMATION
AB Human-robot collaboration is becoming increasingly important as robots become more involved in various aspects of human life in the era of Artificial Intelligence. However, the issue of human operators' trust in robots remains a significant concern, primarily due to the lack of adequate semantic understanding and communication between humans and robots. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, provides an opportunity to develop an interactive, communicative, and robust human-robot collaboration approach. This paper explores the impact of ChatGPT on trust in a human-robot collaboration assembly task. This study designs a robot control system called RoboGPT using ChatGPT to control a 7-degree-of-freedom robot arm to help human operators fetch, and place tools, while human operators can communicate with and control the robot arm using natural language. A human-subject experiment showed that incorporating ChatGPT in robots significantly increased trust in human-robot collaboration, which can be attributed to the robot's ability to communicate more effectively with humans. Furthermore, ChatGPT's ability to understand the nuances of human language and respond appropriately helps to build a more natural and intuitive human-robot interaction. The findings of this study have significant implications for the development of trustworthy human-robot collaboration systems.

AB The modelling and measurement of expertise is a relatively new research area in artificial intelligence and cognitive science. Many domains do not have a formal method for evaluating expertise. When formal methods exist, they are frequently inefficient. Using an extension to the IAM program, a pattern recognition and acquisition method for evaluating the level of expertise for the domain of chess is developed. Chess players, as well as experts in other domains, use cognitive chunks of perceptual patterns to gain a cognitive economy that enables them to evaluate complex domain situations faster and more accurately than novices. The IAM program acquires a representative collection of the perceptual patterns demonstrated by a domain expert and uses those patterns to analyse skill level. A longitudinal study of a developing player and a comparison of the developing player to an established expert demonstrates the utility of the developed method for evaluating expertise.

AB Simple Summary Lung cancer screening has been shown to help reduce mortality in selected populations of smokers; however, performing screening programs at a larger scale with high accuracy is still a challenge. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) has been investigated to improve large scale screening. We have performed a meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of deep learning (DL) algorithms to diagnose lung cancer. Combining six eligible studies, the pooled sensitivity and specificity of DL algorithms were 0.93 (95% CI 0.85-0.98) and 0.68 (95% CI 0.49-0.84), respectively. Despite remaining challenges in the field, AI is likely to play an important role in disease screening in the future. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic performance of current deep learning algorithms for the diagnosis of lung cancer. We searched major databases up to June 2022 to include studies that used artificial intelligence to diagnose lung cancer, using the histopathological analysis of true positive cases as a reference. The quality of the included studies was assessed independently by two authors based on the revised Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies. Six studies were included in the analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.93 (95% CI 0.85-0.98) and 0.68 (95% CI 0.49-0.84), respectively. Despite the significantly high heterogeneity for sensitivity (I-2 = 94%, p < 0.01) and specificity (I-2 = 99%, p < 0.01), most of it was attributed to the threshold effect. The pooled SROC curve with a bivariate approach yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.90 (95% CI 0.86 to 0.92). The DOR for the studies was 26.7 (95% CI 19.7-36.2) and heterogeneity was 3% (p = 0.40). In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we found that when using the summary point from the SROC, the pooled sensitivity and specificity of DL algorithms for the diagnosis of lung cancer were 93% and 68%, respectively.

AB Service robots as an example of service innovation has been of great interest to researchers as it could produce greater value-in-use for consumers during service encounters. However, the question of how and why service robots may affect consumers remains inadequately understood. Leveraging service-dominant logic and the heuristic-systematic model, Study 1 examines the impacts of service innovation types on brand equity and the moderating role of consumer expertise. Study 2 explores whether cognitive and emotional trust can bridge the underlying mechanism. We find that consumers with higher levels of service expertise rate firms with supportive innovation (vs. interactive innovation) higher in brand equity. On the other hand, service novices rate firms with both types of service innovation similarly. Emotional trust significantly mediates the effect mentioned above. In addition, consumers with high technology expertise will better recognize firms' service innovation efforts regardless of innovation type. Our findings extend the service innovation literature by demonstrating how individual-level factors such as consumer expertise help explain the relationships between various types of service robots and consumer response. Moreover, we reveal the importance for service brands to invest in different service robots based on target groups and build emotional trust with consumers.

AB Augmentation-based artificial intelligence (AI) artifacts are increasingly being incorporated into the workplace. The coupling of employees and AI tools, given their complementary strengths, expands and expedites employees' access to information and affords important learning opportunities. However, existing research has yet to fully understand the learning-based benefits and challenges for employees in augmentation. Integrating insights from AI augmentation literature and cognitive load theory, we conducted a daily diary study to understand employees' experience using augmentation-based AI at work on a daily basis. We theorized and found that, on the one hand, frequent usage of augmentation-based AI during a workday was associated with greater knowledge gain and subsequently better task performance at the end of the workday. On the other hand, using augmentation-based AI frequently also led employees to experience information overload, which in turn impaired their performance and recovery at the end of the workday. In addition to elucidating the countervailing mechanisms, we identified employee openness to experience as a dispositional factor, and positive affect as a momentary state that shaped the effects of using augmentation-based AI over the workday. Our research has implications for understanding AI augmentation dynamics from a learning-based perspective, as well as AI's impact on employees at large.

AB Background: Although zebrafish are increasingly utilized in biomedicine for CNS disease modelling and drug discovery, this generates big data necessitating objective, precise and reproducible analyses. The artificial intelligence (AI) applications have empowered automated image recognition and video-tracking to ensure more efficient behavioral testing. New method: Capitalizing on several AI tools that most recently became available, here we present a novel openaccess AI-driven platform to analyze tracks of adult zebrafish collected from in vivo neuropharmacological experiments. For this, we trained the AI system to distinguish zebrafish behavioral patterns following systemic treatment with several well-studied psychoactive drugs - nicotine, caffeine and ethanol. Results: Experiment 1 showed the ability of the AI system to distinguish nicotine and caffeine with 75 % and ethanol with 88 % probability and high (81 %) accuracy following a post-training exposure to these drugs. Experiment 2 further validated our system with additional, previously unexposed compounds (cholinergic arecoline and varenicline, and serotonergic fluoxetine), used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Comparison with existing methods: The present study introduces a novel open-access AI-driven approach to analyze locomotor activity of adult zebrafish. Conclusions: Taken together, these findings support the value of custom-made AI tools for unlocking full potential of zebrafish CNS drug research by monitoring, processing and interpreting the results of in vivo experiments.

AB Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] is a significant source of protein and oil and is also widely used as animal feed. Thus, developing lines that are superior in terms of yield, protein, and oil content is important to feed the ever-growing population. As opposed to high-cost phenotyping, genotyping is both cost and time efficient for breeders because evaluating new lines in different environments (location-year combinations) can be costly. Several genomic prediction (GP) methods have been developed to use the marker and environment data effectively to predict the yield or other relevant phenotypic traits of crops. Our study compares a conventional GP method (genomic best linear unbiased predictor [GBLUP]), a kernel method (Gaussian kernel [GK]), an artificial-intelligence (AI) method (deep learning [DL]), and a hybrid method that corresponds to the emulation of a DL model using a kernel method (an arc-cosine kernel [AK]) in terms of their prediction accuracies for predicting grain yield, oil, and protein using data from the soybean nested association mapping experiment (1,379 genotypes tested in six environments, all genotypes in all environments). The relative performance of the four methods varied with the response variable and whether the model includes the genotype x environmental interaction (GxE) effects or not. The GBLUP consistently showed better performances, whereas GK and AK followed a similar pattern to GBLUP and DL performed slightly worse than the other three methods in most of the cases; however, this may also be attributed to suboptimal hyperparameters. The DL method performed particularly worse than the other three methods in presence of the GxE effects.

AB Recent years have witnessed an increasing number of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in transportation. As a new and emerging technology, AI's potential to advance transportation goals and the full extent of its impacts on the transportation sector is not yet well understood. As the transportation community explores these topics, it is critical to understand how transportation professionals, the driving force behind AI Transportation applications, perceive AI's potential efficiency and equity impacts. Toward this goal, we surveyed transportation professionals in the United States and collected a total of 354 responses. Based on the survey responses, we conducted both descriptive analysis and latent class cluster analysis (LCCA). The former provides an overview of prevalent attitudes among transportation professionals, while the latter allows the identification of distinct segments based on their latent attitudes toward AI. We find widespread optimism regarding AI's potential to improve many aspects of transportation (e.g., efficiency, cost reduction, and traveler experience); however, responses are mixed regarding AI's potential to advance equity. Moreover, many respondents are concerned that AI ethics are not well understood in the transportation community and that AI use in transportation could exacerbate existing inequalities. Through LCCA, we have identified four latent segments: AI Neutral, AI Optimist, AI Pessimist, and AI Skeptic. The latent class membership is significantly associated with respondents' age, education level, and AI knowledge level. Overall, the study results shed light on the extent to which the transportation community as a whole is ready to leverage AI systems to transform current practices and inform targeted education to improve the understanding of AI among transportation professionals.

AB Hydrology is a mature physical science based on application of first principles. However, the water system is complex and its study requires analysis of increasingly large data available from conventional and novel remote sensing and IoT sensor technologies. New data-driven approaches like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are attracting much "hype" despite their apparent limitations (transparency, interpretability, ethics). Some AI/ML applications lack in addressing explicitly important hydrological questions, focusing mainly on "black-box" prediction without providing mechanistic insights. We present a typology of four main types of hydrological problems based on their dominant space and time scales, review their current tools and challenges, and identify important opportunities for AI/ML in hydrology around three main topics: data management, insights and knowledge extraction, and modelling structure. Instead of just for prediction, we propose that AI/ML can be a powerful inductive and exploratory dimension-reduction tool within the rich hydrological toolchest to support the development of new theories that address standing gaps in changing hydrological systems. AI/ML can incorporate other forms of structured and non-structured data and traditional knowledge typically not considered in process-based models. This can help us further advance process-based understanding, forecasting and management of hydrological systems, particularly at larger integrated system scales with big models. We call for reimagining the original definition of AI in hydrology to incorporate not only today's main focus on learning, but on decision analytics and action rules, and on development of autonomous machines in a continuous cycle of learning and refinement in the context of strong ethical, legal, social, and economic constrains. For this, transdisciplinary communities of knowledge and practice will need to be forged with strong investment from the public sector and private engagement to protect water as a common good under accelerated demand and environmental change.

AB Human activity recognition (HAR) has multifaceted applications due to its worldly usage of acquisition devices such as smartphones, video cameras, and its ability to capture human activity data. While electronic devices and their applications are steadily growing, the advances in Artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutionized the ability to extract deep hidden information for accurate detection and its interpretation. This yields a better understanding of rapidly growing acquisition devices, AI, and applications, the three pillars of HAR under one roof. There are many review articles published on the general characteristics of HAR, a few have compared all the HAR devices at the same time, and few have explored the impact of evolving AI architecture. In our proposed review, a detailed narration on the three pillars of HAR is presented covering the period from 2011 to 2021. Further, the review presents the recommendations for an improved HAR design, its reliability, and stability. Five major findings were: (1) HAR constitutes three major pillars such as devices, AI and applications; (2) HAR has dominated the healthcare industry; (3) Hybrid AI models are in their infancy stage and needs considerable work for providing the stable and reliable design. Further, these trained models need solid prediction, high accuracy, generalization, and finally, meeting the objectives of the applications without bias; (4) little work was observed in abnormality detection during actions; and (5) almost no work has been done in forecasting actions. We conclude that: (a) HAR industry will evolve in terms of the three pillars of electronic devices, applications and the type of AI. (b) AI will provide a powerful impetus to the HAR industry in future.

AB Objectives: To provide an introduction to the uses of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and foundation models, including large language models, in the field of health technology assessment (HTA). Methods: We reviewed applications of generative AI in 3 areas: systematic literature reviews, real- world evidence, and health economic modeling. Results: (1) Literature reviews: generative AI has the potential to assist in automating aspects of systematic literature reviews by proposing search terms, screening abstracts, extracting data, and generating code for meta-analyses; (2) real-world evidence: generative AI can facilitate automating processes and analyze large collections of real-world data, including unstructured clinical notes and imaging; (3) health economic modeling: generative AI can aid in the development of health economic models, from conceptualization to validation. Limitations in the use of foundation models and large language models include challenges surrounding their scientific rigor and reliability, the potential for bias, implications for equity, as well as nontrivial concerns regarding adherence to regulatory and ethical standards, particularly in terms of data privacy and security. Additionally, we survey the current policy landscape and provide suggestions for HTA agencies on responsibly integrating generative AI into their workflows, emphasizing the importance of human oversight and the fast-evolving nature of these tools. Conclusions: Although generative AI technology holds promise with respect to HTA applications, it is still undergoing rapid developments and improvements. Continued careful evaluation of their applications to HTA is required. Both developers and users of research incorporating these tools, should familiarize themselves with their current capabilities and limitations.

AB Broadly speaking, building energy use prediction can be classified into two categories based on modeling approaches namely engineering and Artificial Intelligence (AI). While engineering approach requires solving physical equations representing the thermal performance of systems and components that constitute the buildings, the AI-based approach uses historical data to predict future performance. Although engineering approach estimates energy use with greater accuracy, it falls short in the overall complexity of model building and simulation in which detailed data that represent the building geometry, systems, configurations, and occupant schedule is needed. Whereas, the AI-based approach offers a rapid prediction of building energy use and, if appropriately trained and tested, may be used for quick and efficient decision making of energy use reduction. Nevertheless, for robust integration with and to improve automated building systems management and intelligence, the need for consistent, stable, and higher prediction accuracy cannot be understated. To alleviate the instability issue, and to improve prediction accuracy, we have exploited and tested an ensemble learning technique, 'Ensemble Bagging Trees' (EBT), using data obtained from meteorological systems and building-level occupancy and meters Results showed that the proposed EBT model predicted hourly electricity demand of the test building with improved accuracy of Mean Absolute Prediction Error that ranged from 2.97% to 4.63%. Additionally, results showed that proposed variable selection method could reduce the computation time of EBT by 38-41% without sacrificing the prediction accuracy. The proposed ensemble learning model that exemplifies improved prediction accuracy over other AI techniques can be used for real-time applications such as system fault detection and diagnosis.

AB Remote sensing technologies and predictive models have seen significant advancements, yet issues related to data quality, consistency, and accuracy persist. While many studies emphasize model accuracy, the precision and consistency of these technologies are often overlooked. This study addresses that gap by conducting a comprehensive evaluation of Agroview, a cloud-based AI-driven application, assessing its performance in analyzing plant-level data, such as inventory, canopy height, area, and leaf density, across two citrus blocks over four distinct data collection dates. Agroview demonstrated consistent reliability, with low coefficients of variation (CV) across key metrics. For example, tree inventory showed variations of <3 %, with CVs of 2.63 % for Block A and 1.56 % for Block B. Canopy height measurements exhibited CVs below 9 % for most trees, with a slightly higher CV of 12 % for trees over 12 ft in Block B. This analysis highlights the software's precision and identifies areas for potential refinement. The findings of this study highlight the importance of precision in remote sensing, providing valuable insights for users and stakeholders while promoting confidence in the broader adoption of advanced technologies in agriculture.

DT Editorial Material
AB Transformative technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) make difficult tasks more accessible and convenient. Since 2018, the use of AI in research has increased drastically, with annual publication rates of 3-5 times higher than pre-2017. Currently, >100,000 manuscripts using AI are published annually within science and engineering, and >20,000 of these belong to the agricultural and environmental fields. Given the magnitude of use, clear communication on how AI is used and how it helps advance scientific knowledge is essential. Clear communication is perhaps more necessary with AI than previous technologies due to its broad and flexible spectrum of uses, the "black-box" nature of deep-learning algorithms, and ongoing debates regarding AI's predictive power versus knowledge of first-principles mechanistic and process-based theories and models. In this commentary, we provide guidelines and discussion points to the scientific community to ensure transparent and effective communication of AI research in agricultural and environmental research publications.

AB Printed circuit board (PCB) assurance in the optical domain is a crucial field of study. Though there are many existing PCB assurance methods using image processing, computer vision (CV), and machine learning (ML), the PCB field is complex and increasingly evolving, so new techniques are required to overcome the emerging problems. Existing ML-based methods outperform traditional CV methods; however, they often require more data, have low explainability, and can be difficult to adapt when a new technology arises. To overcome these challenges, CV methods can be used in tandem with ML methods. In particular, human-interpretable CV algorithms such as those that extract color, shape, and texture features increase PCB assurance explainability. This allows for incorporation of prior knowledge, which effectively reduces the number of trainable ML parameters and, thus, the amount of data needed to achieve high accuracy when training or retraining an ML model. Hence, this study explores the benefits and limitations of a variety of common computer vision-based features for the task of PCB component detection. The study results indicate that color features demonstrate promising performance for PCB component detection. The purpose of this paper is to facilitate collaboration between the hardware assurance, computer vision, and machine learning communities.

AB In recent years, Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) have been extensively adopted in broad Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications and have demonstrated ability and effectiveness in solving learning problems. However, developing high-performance hardware accelerators on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) for CNNs often demands skills in hardware design and verification, accurate distribution localization, and long development cycles. Besides, the depth of CNN architectures increases by reusing and replicating several layers. In this work, we take advantage of the replication of CNN layers to achieve improvement in design performance and productivity. We propose a programming flow for CNNs on FPGA to generate high-performance accelerators by assembling CNN pre-implemented components as a puzzle based on the graph topology. Using pre-implemented components allows us to use minimum of resources, predict the performance, and gain in productivity since there is no need to synthesize any Hardware Description Language (HDL) source code. Furthermore, the pre-implemented components are reused for different range of applications, reducing the engineering time. Through prototyping, we demonstrate the viability and relevance of our approach. Experiments show a productivity improvement of up to 69% compared to a traditional FPGA implementation while achieving over 1.75x higher Fmax with lower resources and higher energy efficiency.(C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB Objectives: To determine the optimal quantity of learning data needed to develop artificial intelligence (AI) that can automatically identify cephalometric landmarks.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 2400 cephalograms were collected, and 80 landmarks were manually identified by a human examiner. Of these, 2200 images were chosen as the learning data to train AI. The remaining 200 images were used as the test data. A total of 24 combinations of the quantity of learning data (50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, and 2000) were selected by the random sampling method without replacement, and the number of detecting targets per image (19, 40, and 80) were used in the AI training procedures. The training procedures were repeated four times. A total of 96 different AIs were produced. The accuracy of each AI was evaluated in terms of radial error.
   Results: The accuracy of AI increased linearly with the increasing number of learning data sets on a logarithmic scale. It decreased with increasing numbers of detection targets. To estimate the optimal quantity of learning data, a prediction model was built. At least 2300 sets of learning data appeared to be necessary to develop AI as accurate as human examiners.
   Conclusions: A considerably large quantity of learning data was necessary to develop accurate AI. The present study might provide a basis to determine how much learning data would be necessary in developing AI.

AB In this study, the previous work, present status, benefits, and limitations of the state-of-the-art technologies used in smart spraying technologies in precision weed management are reviewed. A total of 116 articles were identified from Google Scholar and Scopus to study the research work in the field of smart sprayers and precision weed management. The articles were examined based on the relevance, research focus, novelties, measured parameters, used technologies, and field of applications. Smart sprayers based on machine vision (MV) and artificial intelligence (AI) are keys to improving crop productivity and meeting the food demands of the future by reducing the yield losses due to weeds and working towards a sustainable future in agriculture. Many papers published in recent years have focused more on the machine vision, weed detection, and classification aspects of the weeding robot. Very few studies have attempted to discuss the components of a smart weeding machine, non-chemical-based weeders, the components of spraying systems, their controls, underlying fluid mechanics, and the field trials of these weeding robots. This article reviews conventional weeding techniques, machine-vision-based weeding robots, and spraying systems proposed or constructed in the last twenty-five years. Key technologies such as non-chemical-based weeding machines, image preprocessing, feature extraction, and weed detection based on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) for smart sprayers are discussed. The fundamental components of a smart spraying system are also discussed, and previous works are compared to highlight the key components, the spraying accuracy, and the major advantages and disadvantages. The fluid mechanics of the spraying system and its associated controls involved are also presented. There are still many bottlenecks in weed detection systems and smart spraying systems. The results of the systematic review provide an understanding of the progress made in the field of robotic weed detection, herbicide and non-herbicide-based weed management, the use of machine vision, and the limitations of the current spraying systems.

SO JNCI CANCER SPECTRUM
LA English
DT Article
AB Data about the quality of cancer information that chatbots and other artificial intelligence systems provide are limited. Here, we evaluate the accuracy of cancer information on ChatGPT compared with the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) answers by using the questions on the "Common Cancer Myths and Misconceptions" web page. The NCI's answers and ChatGPT answers to each question were blinded, and then evaluated for accuracy (accurate: yes vs no). Ratings were evaluated independently for each question, and then compared between the blinded NCI and ChatGPT answers. Additionally, word count and Flesch-Kincaid readability grade level for each individual response were evaluated. Following expert review, the percentage of overall agreement for accuracy was 100% for NCI answers and 96.9% for ChatGPT outputs for questions 1 through 13 (kappa = -0.03, standard error = 0.08). There were few noticeable differences in the number of words or the readability of the answers from NCI or ChatGPT. Overall, the results suggest that ChatGPT provides accurate information about common cancer myths and misconceptions.

AB Background: Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and a medical emergency. The ADAMTS13 (AS13) activity assay is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Within the context of limited laboratory resources, a machine learning (ML) was developed to potentially reduce overutilization of AS13 testing and aid clinical colleagues in the future. Methods: A hybrid approach, consisting of both inhouse and literature data, was taken to acquire the data to train and test the decision tree (DT) ML model. The dataset consisted of 104 patients (30 inhouse, 74 literature-derived) with an equal mix of TTP to non-TTP patients (52 each). The features used to develop the supervised DT model were directly acquired from the PLASMIC score. Results: The optimized DT model overall accuracy on the testing dataset was 81%. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive were 100%, 69%, 67%, and 100%, respectively. Conclusions: We were able to improve the overall performance of the DT model while maintaining a high NPV. However, this invariably translated to potentially increased false positive results (outcomes classified as TTP are actually non-TTP), our overall goal was not to restrict testing on any potentially true TTP cases. This study was done with limited clinical laboratory resources and continues to be a project in progress. However, as laboratory specialists become more involved in artificial intelligence (AI)/ML initiatives, institutions will need to provide them with a modern information technology (IT) infrastructure with adequate resources to enable these efforts to meet the needs of the future health care system.

AB An expert system (ES) has been developed to assist citrus spray applicators in planning and evaluating their sprayer operations. The ES is partitioned into two parts: (1) spray planning (procedures and calculations for sprayer calibration as well as suitability of spraying under given weather parameters) and (2) spray evaluation (estimation of overall spray deposition, ground fallout, and drift as percentages of the total spray discharged at orchard scale). The first part is based on established procedures and the second part is built on the previously developed spray deposition model. The latter includes a "What-If" analysis function that gives feedback on changes in input variables and the corresponding outputs. Testing of the ES revealed that the trends in the outputs, reflecting the effects of application rate, travel speed, foliage density, and percent missing trees were in general agreement with literature. The ES was evaluated by five individuals with diverse experience in spray applications. Overall, the ES was found useful for calibration and evaluation of spray applications in citrus.

DT Article
ID RACIAL-DISCRIMINATION; ENGLISH; BLACK; RACE
AB Research on bias in artificial intelligence has grown exponentially in recent years, especially around racial bias. Many modern technologies which impact people's lives have been shown to have significant racial biases, including automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Emerging studies have found that widely-used ASR systems function much more poorly on the speech of Black people. Yet, this work is limited because it lacks a deeper consideration of the sociolinguistic literature on African American Language (AAL). In this paper, then, we seek to integrate AAL research into these endeavors to analyze ways in which ASRs might be biased against the linguistic features of AAL and how the use of biased ASRs could prove harmful to speakers of AAL. Specifically, we (1) provide an overview of the ways in which AAL has been discriminated against in the workforce and healthcare in the past, and (2) explore how introducing biased ASRs in these areas could perpetuate or even deepen linguistic discrimination. We conclude with a number of questions for reflection and future work, offering this document as a resource for cross-disciplinary collaboration.

AB To meet the expected demand for food while protecting animal welfare, environmental sustainability, and profitability, animal production efficiency must improve. Improvements in grazinglands management techniques can impact livestock production efficiency. The current stage of artificial intelligence development, mainly machine learning techniques, remote sensing (RS), and precision agriculture technologies, automatizes data collection and raises the monitoring capacity to support on-farm decision-making. This literature review presents current developments in precision livestock farming (PLF) applied to grazinglands monitoring and management, demonstrates some knowledge gaps, and discusses potential solutions of grazinglands management issues. Although the implementation of precision technologies in grazing systems is advancing rapidly, challenges, such as lack of reliable reference data and low variability of datasets used to calibrate models, are examples of constraints to be addressed in future studies. More effort in terms of relationship strengthening between farmers and researchers, benefits elucidation, cooperation among professionals with different expertise, and software or app development must be directed to make the knowledge accessible and largely implemented in field conditions.

AB ObjectivesArtificial intelligence is evolving and significantly impacting health care, promising to transform access to medical information. With the rise of medical misinformation and frequent internet searches for health-related advice, there is a growing demand for reliable patient information. This study assesses the effectiveness of ChatGPT in providing information and treatment options for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).MethodsSix inputs were entered into ChatGPT regarding the definition, prevalence, causes, symptoms, treatment options, and postoperative complications of CRS. International Consensus Statement on Allergy and Rhinology guidelines for Rhinosinusitis was the gold standard for evaluating the answers. The inputs were categorized into three categories and Flesch-Kincaid readability, ANOVA and trend analysis tests were used to assess them.ResultsAlthough some discrepancies were found regarding CRS, ChatGPT's answers were largely in line with existing literature. Mean Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level and passive voice percentage were (40.7%, 12.15%, 22.5%) for basic information and prevalence category, (47.5%, 11.2%, 11.1%) for causes and symptoms category, (33.05%, 13.05%, 22.25%) for treatment and complications, and (40.42%, 12.13%, 18.62%) across all categories. ANOVA indicated no statistically significant differences in readability across the categories (p-values: Flesch Reading Ease = 0.385, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level = 0.555, Passive Sentences = 0.601). Trend analysis revealed readability varied slightly, with a general increase in complexity.ConclusionChatGPT is a developing tool potentially useful for patients and medical professionals to access medical information. However, caution is advised as its answers may not be fully accurate compared to clinical guidelines or suitable for patients with varying educational backgrounds. Level of evidence: 4.ConclusionChatGPT is a developing tool potentially useful for patients and medical professionals to access medical information. However, caution is advised as its answers may not be fully accurate compared to clinical guidelines or suitable for patients with varying educational backgrounds. Level of evidence: 4.
   This study evaluates the capability of ChatGPT-an artificial intelligence chatbot-to provide accurate and readable information on chronic rhinosinusitis, comparing its responses against established medical guidelines. Findings reveal that while responses align generally with the literature; readability analyses the highlight areas of complexity that may challenge the patient understanding. The study underscores ChatGPT's potential in enhancing healthcare communication, emphasizing the need for accuracy, and readability adjustments to cater to diverse educational backgrounds. image

AB The worldwide prevalence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is increasing, causing a significant medical burden, but no approved therapeutics are currently available. NASH drug development requires histological analysis of liver biopsies by expert pathologists for trial enrolment and efficacy assessment, which can be hindered by multiple issues including sample heterogeneity, inter-reader and intra-reader variability, and ordinal scoring systems. Consequently, there is a high unmet need for accurate, reproducible, quantitative, and automated methods to assist pathologists with histological analysis to improve the precision around treatment and efficacy assessment. Digital pathology (DP) workflows in combination with artificial intelligence (AI) have been established in other areas of medicine and are being actively investigated in NASH to assist pathologists in the evaluation and scoring of NASH histology. DP/AI models can be used to automatically detect, localise, quantify, and score histological parameters and have the potential to reduce the impact of scoring variability in NASH clinical trials. This narrative review provides an overview of DP/AI tools in development for NASH, highlights key regulatory considerations, and discusses how these advances may impact the future of NASH clinical management and drug development. This should be a high priority in the NASH field, particularly to improve the development of safe and effective therapeutics. (c) 2023 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

AB Artificial neural networks have received considerable attention in recent years as their particular properties have come to be recognised, especially their ability to learn and tolerance to noise. In this paper, we describe how some of the properties of neural networks can be used to assist the medicinal chemist in the design of drugs. Specifically, the back propagation neural network has been used to determine the partition coefficient and aqueous solubility of a number of organic compounds. The partition coefficient and aqueous solubility were chosen since they are known to correlate well with biological activity. The results obtained show that the neural network after training can be used to determine the partition coefficient and solubility of a series of unknown compounds to an accuracy comparable to the experimental error.
   Using the partition coefficient data we have conducted an extended series of experiments into the effect that network parameters have on performance. The results show that performance of the neural network can be significantly affected by the choice of network parameters.
   In conclusion, we propose a system for predicting pharmacological activity incorporating an expert system and multiple neural networks and describe the benefits that such a system may offer.

AB As instruction shifts away from traditional approaches, online learning has grown in popularity in K-12 and higher education. Artificial intelligence (AI) and learning analytics methods such as machine learning have been used by educational scholars to support online learners on a large scale. However, the fairness of AI prediction in educational contexts has received insufficient attention, which can increase educational inequality. This study aims to fill this gap by proposing a fair logistic regression (Fair-LR) algorithm. Specifically, we developed Fair-LR and compared it with fairness-unaware AI models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest). We evaluated fairness with equalized odds that caters to statistical type I and II errors in predictions across demographic subgroups. The results showed that the Fair-LR could generate desirable predictive accuracy while achieving better fairness. The findings implied that the educational community could adopt a methodological shift to achieve accurate and fair AI to support learning and reduce bias.

AB Background: Patients with skin lesions suspicious for skin cancer or atypical melanocytic nevi of uncertain malignant potential often present to dermatologists, who may have variable dermoscopy triage clinical experience. Objective: To evaluate the clinical utility of a digital dermoscopy image-based artificial intelligence algorithm (DDI-AI device) on the diagnosis and management of skin cancers by dermatologists. Methods: Thirty-six United States board-certified dermatologists evaluated 50 clinical images and 50 digital dermoscopy images of the same skin lesions (25 malignant and 25 benign), first without and then with knowledge of the DDI-AI device output. Participants indicated whether they thought the lesion was likely benign (unremarkable) or malignant (suspicious). Results: The management sensitivity of dermatologists using the DDI-AI device was 91.1%, compared to 84.3% with DDI, and 70.0% with clinical images. The management specificity was 71.0%, compared to 68.4% and 64.9%, respectively. The diagnostic sensitivity of dermatologists using the DDI-AI device was 86.1%, compared to 78.8% with DDI, and 63.4% with clinical images. Diagnostic specificity using the DDI-AI device increased to 80.7%, compared to 75.9% and 73.6%, respectively. Conclusion: The use of the DDI-AI device may quickly, safely, and effectively improve dermoscopy performance, skin cancer diagnosis, and management when used by dermatologists, independent of training and experience.

AB Neural networks have become one of the most popularly used methods in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Due to the universal approximation theorem, a neural network with one hidden layer can approximate any continuous function on compact support as long as the number of hidden units is sufficiently large. Statistically, a neural network can be classified into a nonlinear regression framework. However, if we consider it parametrically, due to the unidentifiability of the parameters, it is difficult to derive its asymptotic properties. Instead, we consider the estimation problem in a nonparametric regression framework and use the results from sieve estimation to establish the consistency, the rates of convergence and the asymptotic normality of the neural network estimators. We also illustrate the validity of the theories via simulations.

AB In the face of increasing agricultural demands and environmental concerns, the effective management of weeds presents a pressing challenge in modern agriculture. Weeds not only compete with crops for resources but also pose threats to food safety and agricultural sustainability through the indiscriminate use of herbicides, which can lead to environmental contamination and herbicide-resistant weed populations. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has ushered in a paradigm shift in agriculture, particularly in the domain of weed management. AI's utilization in this domain extends beyond mere innovation, offering precise and eco-friendly solutions for the identification and control of weeds, thereby addressing critical agricultural challenges. This article aims to examine the application of AI in weed management in the context of weed detection and the increasing impact of deep learning techniques in the agricultural sector. Through an assessment of research articles, this study identifies critical factors influencing the adoption and implementation of AI in weed management. These criteria encompass factors of AI adoption (food safety, increased effectiveness, and eco-friendliness through herbicides reduction), AI implementation factors (capture technology, training datasets, AI models, and outcomes and accuracy), ancillary technologies (IoT, UAV, field robots, and herbicides), and the related impact of AI methods adoption (economic, social, technological, and environmental). Of the 5821 documents found, 99 full-text articles were assessed, and 68 were included in this study. The review highlights AI's role in enhancing food safety by reducing herbicide residues, increasing effectiveness in weed control strategies, and promoting ecofriendliness through judicious herbicide use. It underscores the importance of capture technology, training datasets, AI models, and accuracy metrics in AI implementation, emphasizing their synergy in revolutionizing weed management practices. Ancillary technologies, such as IoT, UAVs, field robots, and AI-enhanced herbicides, complement AI's capabilities, offering holistic and data-driven approaches to weed control. Additionally, the adoption of AI methods influences economic, social, technological, and environmental dimensions of agriculture. Last but not least, digital literacy emerges as a crucial enabler, empowering stakeholders to navigate AI technologies effectively and contribute to the sustainable transformation of weed management practices in agriculture.

AB Automated Planning has been an active research topic for more than thirty years, but only recently has it started to move in the direction of combining planning and execution to achieve what is sometimes called Intelligent Reactive Planning. We propose Simulation-Based planning as a new way to perform intelligent reactive planning. Simulation-Based planning-unlike most other planning systems-integrates simulation into the planning process. Once a set of plans is generated, simulations are used to test and evaluate the plans to choose the most applicable plan for that current situation. In most planning systems, plan evaluation depends on rules alone, and because rules must be designed general enough to cover all possible cases, the evaluation is not specific enough for some individual cases. However, when the plan evaluation is done through simulations, the evaluation can be more fine-tuned to individual cases and can better allow better plans to be chosen for that individual case. From the military planning perspective, the simulation-based planner is also quite useful due to its ability to perform adversarial and multi-agent planning. This is a natural consequence of using simulation in the planning process. By allowing other entities such as the enemy to simulate in parallel with the planner's forces, the planner is able to observe, prior to the actual execution, the effects of adversarial and multi-agent actions against its own plans.

AB Advancements in sensor technology, artificial intelligence (AI), and augmented reality (AR) have unlocked opportunities across various domains. AR and large language models like GPT have witnessed substantial progress and increasingly are being employed in diverse fields. One such promising application is in operations and maintenance (O&M). O&M tasks often involve complex procedures and sequences that can be challenging to memorize and execute correctly, particularly for novices or in high-stress situations. By combining the advantages of superimposing virtual objects onto the physical world and generating human-like text using GPT, we can revolutionize O&M operations. This study introduces a system that combines AR, optical character recognition (OCR), and the GPT language model to optimize user performance while offering trustworthy interactions and alleviating workload in O&M tasks. This system provides an interactive virtual environment controlled by the Unity game engine, facilitating a seamless interaction between virtual and physical realities. A case study (N=30) was conducted to illustrate the findings and answer the research questions. The Multidimensional Measurement of Trust (MDMT) was applied to understand the complexity of trust engagement with such a human-like system. The results indicate that users can complete similarly challenging tasks in less time using our proposed AR and AI system. Moreover, the collected data also suggest a reduction in cognitive load when executing the same operations using the AR and AI system. A divergence of trust was observed concerning capability and ethical dimensions.

AB Human activities generate a large amount of environmental pollutants, including drugs and agricultural and industrial chemicals that are released into the air, water, and soil. Environmental pollutants can enter food animals through contaminated feed and water, posing risks to human health via the food chain. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling is used to predict the target organ dosimetry informing human health risk assessment. However, there is a lack of critical reviews concerning PBPK models for environmental pollutants in food animals in the last several years (2020-2024). This review is part of a series of reviews focusing on applications of PBPK models for drugs and environmental chemicals in food animals to inform human health and food safety assessments. Part I is focused on veterinary drugs. The present article is Part II and focuses on environmental chemicals, including pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), bisphenols, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). This article discusses the existing challenges in developing PBPK models for environmental pollutants and shares our perspectives on future directions, including the combinations of in vitro to in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE), machine learning and artificial intelligence, read-across approaches, and quantitative pharmacodynamic modeling to enhance the potential applications of PBPK models in assessing human health and food safety.

AB Due to the ever-growing demands for electronic chips in different sectors, semiconductor companies have been mandated to offshore their manufacturing processes. This unwanted matter has made security and trustworthiness of their fabricated chips concerning and has caused the creation of hardware attacks. In this condition, different entities in the semiconductor supply chain can act maliciously and execute an attack on the design computing layers, from devices to systems. Our attack is a hardware Trojan that is inserted during mask generation/fabrication in an untrusted foundry. The Trojan leaves a footprint in the fabrication through addition, deletion, or change of design cells. To tackle this problem, we propose EVHA (Explainable Vision System for Hardware Testing and Assurance) in this work, which can detect the smallest possible change to a design in a low-cost, accurate, and fast manner. The inputs to this system are scanning electron microscopy images acquired from the integrated circuits under examination. The system output is the determination of integrated circuit status in terms of having any defect and/or hardware Trojan through addition, deletion, or change in the design cells at the cell level. This article provides an overview on the design, development, implementation, and analysis of our defense system.

AB Plant pathology has developed a wide range of concepts and tools for improving plant disease management, including models for understanding and responding to new risks from climate change. Most of these tools can be improved using new advances in artificial intelligence (AI), such as machine learning to integrate massive data sets in predictive models. There is the potential to develop automated analyses of risk that alert decision-makers, from farm managers to national plant protection organizations, to the likely need for action and provide decision support for targeting responses.We review machine-learning applications in plant pathology and synthesize ideas for the next steps to make the most of these tools in digital agriculture. Global projects, such as the proposed global surveillance system for plant disease, will be strengthened by the integration of the wide range of new data, including data from tools like remote sensors, that are used to evaluate the risk of plant disease. There is exciting potential for the use of AI to strengthen global capacity building as well, from image analysis for disease diagnostics and associated management recommendations on farmers' phones to future training methodologies for plant pathologists that are customized in real-time for management needs in response to the current risks. International cooperation in integrating data and models will help develop the most effective responses to new challenges from climate change.

AB Public participation is vital to achieving successful plan outcomes, whereas meaningful participation requires at least informing and consulting the public. However, collecting frequent feedback from the public is a labour-intensive process. Information technologies like Google Maps Reviews offer to collect extensive public inputs by allowing users to share their feedback and ratings about services. Machine learning methods are ideal for analyzing these reviews to understand users' experiences. This study proposes a machine learning application using Google Maps Reviews to examine feedback on the selected parks in Istanbul, Turkiye. Reviews provide insights into not only park features but also its social structure. The introduced method supports surveys and interview methods preferred by planners.

SO JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL MEASUREMENT
LA English
DT Article
ID SELECTION
AB The field of educational measurement places validity and fairness as central concepts of assessment quality. Prior research has proposed embedding fairness arguments within argument-based validity processes, particularly when fairness is conceived as comparability in assessment properties across groups. However, we argue that a more flexible approach to fairness arguments that occurs outside of and complementary to validity arguments is required to address many of the views on fairness that a set of assessment stakeholders may hold. Accordingly, we focus this manuscript on two contributions: (a) introducing the argument-based fairness approach to complement argument-based validity for both traditional and artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced assessments and (b) applying it in an illustrative AI assessment of perceived hireability in automated video interviews used to prescreen job candidates. We conclude with recommendations for further advancing argument-based fairness approaches.

AB Drawing on the concept of the scientific public sphere, this study examines the public sensemaking of communicative AI (e.g., generative AI) on social media. Advancing a framework encompassing cognitive (technology vs. use) and affective (positive vs. negative) dimensions of the public discourse on communicative AI, we analyzed global Twitter (now X) conversations about generative AI tools. Findings showed that the text generator (ChatGPT) discussions centered more on the technology-centered themes, whereas the image generator discussions emphasized their uses. ChatGPT received mixed sentiments in technology-related discussions, while there was more positive sentiment about the its uses. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

DE DICOM; Machine learning; Artificial intelligence; Intracranial
   hemorrhage; Bone age; PACS
AB In the era of data-driven medicine, rapid access and accurate interpretation of medical images are becoming increasingly important. The DICOM Image ANalysis and Archive (DIANA) system is an open-source, lightweight, and scalable Python interface that enables users to interact with hospital Picture Archiving and Communications Systems (PACS) to access such data. In this work, DIANA functionality was detailed and evaluated in the context of retrospective PACS data retrieval and two prospective clinical artificial intelligence (AI) pipelines: bone age (BA) estimation and intra-cranial hemorrhage (ICH) detection. DIANA orchestrates activity beginning with post-acquisition study discovery and ending with online notifications of findings. For AI applications, system latency (exam completion to system report time) was quantified and compared to that of clinicians (exam completion to initial report creation time). Mean DIANA latency was 9.04 +/- 3.83 and 20.17 +/- 10.16 min compared to clinician latency of 51.52 +/- 58.9 and 65.62 +/- 110.39 min for BA and ICH, respectively, with DIANA latencies being significantly lower (p < 0.001). DIANA's capabilities were also explored and found effective in retrieving and anonymizing protected health information for "big-data" medical imaging research and analysis. Mean per-image retrieval times were 1.12 +/- 0.50 and 0.08 +/- 0.01 s across x-ray and computed tomography studies, respectively. The data herein demonstrate that DIANA can flexibly integrate into existing hospital infrastructure and improve the process by which researchers/clinicians access imaging repository data. This results in a simplified workflow for large data retrieval and clinical integration of AI models.

AB Particulate and surfactant systems are an integral part either in processing or product lines in essentially every major industry, including Energy and Minerals, Pharmaceutical, Agriculture & Food, Microelectronics, Healthcare, Cosmetics, Consumer Products, and Analytical Instrumentation & Services. In most applications, product and process specifications depend on the synergistic or competitive interactions between the particles and reagent schemes. The primary goal of our research efforts has been to generate the structure-property-performance correlations-based knowledge and technology platforms for industry to develop more sustainable products and processes. Engineering the physicochemical/mechanical properties of surfaces, particles, and self-assembling surfactant systems enables their enhanced performance in industrial applications. Specifically, understanding and control of the nano and atomic -scale forces between particles and synthesis of functionalized particles form the foundation for targeted contributions in biomedical, advanced materials and minerals, sensor, and coating technologies. A synoptic overview of selected projects is presented in this review. Additional details can be found in the topic-specific references listed at the end of this manuscript.

DE ChatGPT; Artificial intelligence; Research
AB In 2022, OpenAI made a groundbreaking entrance with the release of ChatGPT, a new online chatbot that allows users to interact with the GPT-3.5 language model. Users can ask questions and converse with ChatGPT by typing into a text field similar to direct messaging software. Then, ChatGPT will generate a response. Users can then either respond to ChatGPT, regenerate the previous response, or "like" the response and give feedback. OpenAI improved the program on March 14th, 2023, with the release of GPT 4, which promised better reasoning ability. Both these iterations of ChatGPT have attracted significant attention from researchers due to the software's remarkably enhanced capabilities compared to earlier versions. Due to its inherent value as a research tool, ChatGPT will likely become a permanent fixture, so a thorough evaluation of ethical and professional boundaries is crucial. In this opinion paper, we explore ChatGPT 4.0 by addressing: a) its capabilities, b) its limitations and weaknesses, and c) strategies for fact-checking its output to ensure high-quality responses. Subsequently, the authors delve into the diverse implications of this software and discuss how it can be optimally employed to advance research in technology and various other domains.

AB Storytelling is a human universal. The ubiquity of stories and the rapid development in Artificial Intelligence (AI) pose important questions: can AI like ChatGPT tell engaging and persuasive stories? If so, what makes a narrative engaging and persuasive? Three pre-registered experiments comparing human-generated narratives from existing research and the ChatGPT-generated versions using descriptions and materials from these studies show that labeling AI as a narrative source led to lower transportation, higher counterarguing, and lower story-consistent beliefs. However, AI-generated narratives led to lower (Study 1 and 3) or similar levels (Study 2) of counterarguing than the human-generated version. Readers showed lower (Study 2) or similar levels of transportation (Study 1 and 3) when reading the AI- than the human-generated stories. We suggest the AI model's linguistic competence and logical coherence contribute to its stories' verisimilitude. However, AI's lack of lived experience and creativity may limit its storytelling ability.

AB (Aim) To detect COVID-19 patients more accurately and more precisely, we proposed a novel artificial intelligence model. (Methods) We used previously proposed chest CT dataset containing four categories: COVID-19, community-acquired pneumonia, secondary pulmonary tuberculosis, and healthy subjects. First, we proposed a novel VGG-style base network (VSBN) as backbone network. Second, convolutional block attention module (CBAM) was introduced as attention module into our VSBN. Third, an improved multiple-way data augmentation method was used to resist over-fitting of our Al model. In all, our model was dubbed as a 12-layer attention-based VGG-style network for COVID-19 (AVNC) (Results) This proposed AVNC achieved the sensitivity/precision/F1 per class all above 95%. Particularly, AVNC yielded a micro-averaged F1 score of 96.87%, which is higher than 11 state-of-the-art approaches. (Conclusion) This proposed AVNC is effective in recognizing COVID-19 diseases.

AB The HIV-1 genome is highly heterogeneous. This variation affords the virus a wide range of molecular properties, including the ability to infect cell types, such as macrophages and lymphocytes, expressing different chemokine receptors on the cell surface. In particular, R5 HIV-1 viruses use CCR5 as a coreceptor for viral entry, X4 viruses use CXCR4, whereas some viral strains, known as R5X4 or D-tropic, have the ability to utilize both coreceptors. X4 and R5X4 viruses are associated with rapid disease progression to AIDS. R5X4 viruses differ in that they have yet to be characterized by the examination of the genetic sequence of HIV-1 alone. In this study, a series of experiments was performed to evaluate different strategies of feature selection and neural network optimization. We demonstrate the use of artificial neural networks trained via evolutionary computation to predict viral coreceptor usage. The results indicate the identification of R5X4 viruses with a predictive accuracy of 75.5 percent.

AB Among all the learning resources within MOOCs such as video lectures and homework, the discussion forum stood out as a valuable platform for students' learning through knowledge exchange. However, peer interactions on MOOC discussion forums are scarce. The lack of interactions among MOOC learners can yield negative effects on students' learning, causing low participation and high dropout rate. This research aims to examine the extent to which the deep-learning-based natural language generation (NLG) models can offer responses similar to human-generated responses to the learners in MOOC forums. Specifically, under the framework of social support theory, this study has examined the use of state-of-the-art deep learning models recurrent neural network (RNN) and generative pretrained transformer 2 (GPT-2) to provide students with informational, emotional, and community support with NLG on discussion forums. We first trained an RNN and GPT-2 model with 13,850 entries of post-reply pairs. Quantitative evaluation on model performance was then conducted with word perplexity, readability, and coherence. The results showed that GPT-2 outperformed RNN on all measures. We then qualitatively compared the dimensions of support provided by humans and GPT-2, and the results suggested that the GPT-2 model can comparably provide emotional and community support to human learners with contextual replies. We further surveyed participants to find out if the collected data would align with our findings. The results showed GPT-2 model could provide supportive and contextual replies to a similar extent compared to humans.

TI Caution! AI Bot Has Entered the Patient Chat: ChatGPT Has Limitations in
   Providing Accurate Urologic Healthcare Advice
SO UROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB OBJECTIVE To conduct the first study examining the accuracy of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot, derived patient counseling responses based on clinical care guidelines in urology using a validated questionnaire.METHODS We asked ChatGPT a set of 13 urological guideline-based questions three times. Answers were evaluated for appropriateness and using Brief DISCERN (BD), a validated healthcare in-formation assessment questionnaire. Data analysis included descriptive statistics and Student's t test (SAS Studio).RESULTS 60% (115/195) of ChatGPT responses were deemed appropriate. Variability existed between responses to the same prompt, with 25% of the 13 question sets having discordant appropriateness designations. The average BD score was 16.8 +/- 3.59. Only 7 (54%) of 13 topics and 21 (54%) of 39 responses met the BD cut-off score of >= 16 to denote good-quality content. Appropriateness was associated with higher overall and Relevance domain scores (both P < .01). The lowest BD domain scores were for Source categories, since ChatGPT does not provide references by default. With prompting, 92.3% had >= 1 incorrect, misinterpreted, or nonfunctional citations.CONCLUSION While ChatGPT provides appropriate responses to urological questions more than half of the time, it misinterprets clinical care guidelines, dismisses important contextual information, conceals its sources, and provides inappropriate references. Chatbot models hold great promise, but users should be cautious when interpreting healthcare-related advice from existing AI models. Additional training and modifications are needed before these AI models will be ready for reliable use by patients and providers.

AB Accurately forecasting ridesourcing demand is important for effective transportation planning and policy making. With the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), researchers have started to utilize machine learning models to forecast travel demand, which, in many cases, can produce higher prediction accuracy than statistical models. However, most existing machine-learning studies used a global model to predict the demand and ignored the influence of spatial heterogeneity (i.e., the spatial variations in the impacts of explanatory variables). Spatial heterogeneity can drive the parameter estimations varying over space; failing to consider the spatial variations may limit the model's prediction performance. To account for spatial heterogeneity, this study proposes a Clustering-aided Ensemble Method (CEM) to forecast the zone-to-zone (census-tract-to-census-tract) travel demand for ridesourcing services. Specifically, we develop an interactive clustering approach (powered by human in-the-loop AI) to split the origin-destination pairs into different clusters and ensemble the cluster-specific machine learning models for prediction. We implement and test the proposed methodology by using the ridesourcing-trip data in Chicago. The results show that, with a more transparent and flexible model structure, the CEM significantly improves the prediction accuracy than the benchmark models (i.e., global machine learning and statistical models directly trained on all observations). This study offers transportation researchers and practitioners a new methodology of travel demand forecasting, especially for new travel modes like ridesourcing and micromobility.

AB The advancement in sensors, robotics, and artificial intelligence has enabled a series of methods such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), semantic segmentation, and point cloud registration to help with the reality capture process. To completely investigate an unknown indoor space, obtaining a general spatial comprehension as well as detailed scene reconstruction for a digital twin model requires a deeper insight into the characteristics of different ranging sensors, as well as corresponding techniques to combine data from distinct systems. This paper discusses the necessity and workflow of utilizing two distinct types of scanning sensors, including depth camera and light detection and ranging sensor (LiDAR), paired with a quadrupedal ground robot to obtain spatial data of a large, complex indoor space. A digital twin model was built in real time with two SLAM methods and then consolidated with the geometric feature extraction methods of fast point feature histograms (FPFH) and fast global registration. Finally, the reconstructed scene was streamed to a HoloLens 2 headset to create an illusion of seeing through walls. Results showed that both the depth camera and LiDAR could handle a large space reality capture with both required coverage and fidelity with textural information. As a result, the proposed workflow and analytical pipeline provides a hierarchical data fusion strategy to integrate the advantages of distinct sensing methods and to carry out a complete indoor investigation. It also validates the feasibility of robot-assisted reality capture in larger spaces.

AB AimThe aim of this study was to evaluate and compare artificial intelligence (AI)-based large language models (LLMs) (ChatGPT-3.5, Bing, and Bard) with human-based formulations in generating relevant clinical queries, using comprehensive methodological evaluations.MethodsTo interact with the major LLMs ChatGPT-3.5, Bing Chat, and Google Bard, scripts and prompts were designed to formulate PICOT (population, intervention, comparison, outcome, time) clinical questions and search strategies. Quality of the LLMs responses was assessed using a descriptive approach and independent assessment by two researchers. To determine the number of hits, PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and CINAHL Ultimate search results were imported separately, without search restrictions, with the search strings generated by the three LLMs and an additional one by the expert. Hits from one of the scenarios were also exported for relevance evaluation. The use of a single scenario was chosen to provide a focused analysis. Cronbach's alpha and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were also calculated.ResultsIn five different scenarios, ChatGPT-3.5 generated 11,859 hits, Bing 1,376,854, Bard 16,583, and an expert 5919 hits. We then used the first scenario to assess the relevance of the obtained results. The human expert search approach resulted in 65.22% (56/105) relevant articles. Bing was the most accurate AI-based LLM with 70.79% (63/89), followed by ChatGPT-3.5 with 21.05% (12/45), and Bard with 13.29% (42/316) relevant hits. Based on the assessment of two evaluators, ChatGPT-3.5 received the highest score (M = 48.50; SD = 0.71). Results showed a high level of agreement between the two evaluators. Although ChatGPT-3.5 showed a lower percentage of relevant hits compared to Bing, this reflects the nuanced evaluation criteria, where the subjective evaluation prioritized contextual accuracy and quality over mere relevance.ConclusionThis study provides valuable insights into the ability of LLMs to formulate PICOT clinical questions and search strategies. AI-based LLMs, such as ChatGPT-3.5, demonstrate significant potential for augmenting clinical workflows, improving clinical query development, and supporting search strategies. However, the findings also highlight limitations that necessitate further refinement and continued human oversight.Clinical RelevanceAI could assist nurses in formulating PICOT clinical questions and search strategies. AI-based LLMs offer valuable support to healthcare professionals by improving the structure of clinical questions and enhancing search strategies, thereby significantly increasing the efficiency of information retrieval.

AB Falling injuries pose serious health risks to people of all ages, and knowing the extent of exposure to irregular surfaces will increase the ability to measure fall risk. Current gait analysis methods require overly complicated instrumentation and have not been tested for external factors such as walking surfaces that are encountered in the real-world, thus the results are difficult to extrapolate to real-world situations. Artificial intelligence approaches (in particular deep learning networks of varied architectures) to analyze data collected from wearable sensors were used to identify irregular surface exposure in a real-world setting. Thirty young adults wore six Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors placed on their body (right wrist, trunks at the L5/S1 level, left and right thigh, left and right shank) while walking over eight different surfaces commonly encountered in the living community as well as occupational settings. Three variations of deep learning models were trained to solve this walking surface recognition problem: 1) convolution neural network (CNN); 2) long short term memory (LSTM) network and 3) LSTM structure with an extra global pooling layer (Global-LSTM) which learns the coordination between different data streams (e.g. different channels of the same sensor as well as different sensors). Results indicated that all three deep learning models can recognize walking surfaces with above 0.90 accuracy, with the Global-LSTM yielding the best performance at 0.92 accuracy. In terms of individual sensors, the right thigh based Global-LSTM model reported the highest accuracy (0.90 accuracy). Results from this study provide further evidence that deep learning and wearable sensors can be utilized to recognize irregular walking surfaces induced motion alteration and applied to prevent falling injuries.

AB Generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) is a new technology with potentially broad applications across important domains of healthcare, but serious questions remain about how to balance the promise of generative AI against unintended consequences from adoption of these tools. In this position statement, we provide recommendations on behalf of the Society of General Internal Medicine on how clinicians, technologists, and healthcare organizations can approach the use of these tools. We focus on three major domains of medical practice where clinicians and technology experts believe generative AI will have substantial immediate and long-term impacts: clinical decision-making, health systems optimization, and the patient-physician relationship. Additionally, we highlight our most important generative AI ethics and equity considerations for these stakeholders. For clinicians, we recommend approaching generative AI similarly to other important biomedical advancements, critically appraising its evidence and utility and incorporating it thoughtfully into practice. For technologists developing generative AI for healthcare applications, we recommend a major frameshift in thinking away from the expectation that clinicians will "supervise" generative AI. Rather, these organizations and individuals should hold themselves and their technologies to the same set of high standards expected of the clinical workforce and strive to design high-performing, well-studied tools that improve care and foster the therapeutic relationship, not simply those that improve efficiency or market share. We further recommend deep and ongoing partnerships with clinicians and patients as necessary collaborators in this work. And for healthcare organizations, we recommend pursuing a combination of both incremental and transformative change with generative AI, directing resources toward both endeavors, and avoiding the urge to rapidly displace the human clinical workforce with generative AI. We affirm that the practice of medicine remains a fundamentally human endeavor which should be enhanced by technology, not displaced by it.

AB To address a research gap on how AI can be leveraged to enhance customers' in-store journeys, this study evaluates the effectiveness of an AI-powered conversational decision bot (mobile messaging app) employing two laboratory experiments in a simulated store. Study 1 revealed that consumers found in-store shopping to be more enjoyable and effortful with a decision bot than without, demonstrating that these bots reinforce consumers' instore hedonic and utilitarian experiences. Study 2 evaluated the effectiveness of two types of decision bots (attribute- vs. alternative-based), revealing that consumers' perceived usefulness and reuse/recommend intentions for the bot were higher when using an attribute- as compared to an alternative-based bot. When shopping in-store, consumers benefit from a decision bot that retrieves attribute-level information for the product category rather than one that focuses on single product alternatives. This study makes important theoretical contributions to constructive decision theory, the Elaboration Likelihood Model, and language-based adaptive intelligence.

Traditional components for bad data detection, such as chi-square testing, residual-based methods, and hypothesis testing, are discussed to explain the motivations for recent anomaly-detection methods given the increasing complexity of power grids, energy management systems, and cyber-threats. In particular, state estimation anomaly detection based on data-driven quickest-change detection and artificial intelligence are discussed, and directions for research are suggested with particular emphasis on considerations of the future smart grid.

AB Although endometrial cancer is often diagnosed at an early curable stage, the incidence and mortality from endometrial cancer is rising and minority women are particularly at risk. We hypothesize that delays in clinical presentation contribute to racial disparities in endometrial cancer mortality and treatment-related morbidity. Improved methods for endometrial cancer risk assessment and distinguishing abnormal uterine bleeding and postmenopausal bleeding from physiologic variation are needed. Accordingly, we propose a multipronged strategy that combines innovative patient education with novel early detection strategies to reduce health impacts of endometrial cancer and its precursors, especially among Black women. Futuristic approaches using gamification, smartphone apps, artificial intelligence, and health promotion outside of the physical clinic hold promise in preventing endometrial cancer and reducing morbidity and mortality related to the disease, but they also raise a number of questions that will need to be addressed by future research.

AB Machine learning (ML) is increasingly implemented to model water infrastructure dynamics. Common ML models are primarily data-driven and require a significant amount of data for robust training. Often, obtaining robust data at higher temporal and spatial resolutions in water systems can be challenging due to cost and time considerations. In such scenarios, integrating the existing scientific knowledge into an ML model as physics-informed ML can be advantageous to enhance predictive capability and generalizability. This study examines the predictive capability and generalizability of physics-informed ML and common ML models for typical unit operation and process (UOP) system dynamics in urban water treatment. The systems studied are (1) a continuous stirred-tank reactor, (2) activated sludge reactor, and a (3) fixed-bed granular adsorption reactor. Applications of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are presented. Results demonstrate when the availability of data is limited: (1) common ML models are not necessarily robust for predicting water system dynamics, except when system dynamics exhibit simpler periodic patterns. Common ML models also do not generalize across different loading conditions. (2) In contrast, the developed PINN models yield high predictive capability and generalizability. (3) Benefiting from the embedded prior knowledge, PINNs require significantly reduced data sets for robust predictions. These results suggest hybridizing physics principles and domain knowledge into the ML framework can be critical for robust UOP and water systems modeling.

AB The success of brain-machine interfaces (BMI) is enabled by the remarkable ability of the brain to incorporate the artificial neuroprosthetic 'tool' into its own cognitive space and use it as an extension of the user's body. Unlike other tools, neuroprosthetics create a shared space that seamlessly spans the user's internal goal representation of the world and the external physical environment enabling a much deeper human-tool symbiosis. A key factor in the transformation of 'simple tools' into 'intelligent tools' is the concept of co-adaptation where the tool becomes functionally involved in the extraction and definition of the user's goals. Recent advancements in the neuroscience and engineering of neuroprosthetics are providing a blueprint for how new co-adaptive designs based on reinforcement learning change the nature of a user's ability to accomplish tasks that were not possible using conventional methodologies. By designing adaptive controls and artificial intelligence into the neural interface, tools can become active assistants in goal-directed behavior and further enhance human performance in particular for the disabled population. This paper presents recent advances in computational and neural systems Supporting the development of symbiotic neuroprosthetic assistants. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI A New "Cult of the Offensive?" Elite Perceptions of Artificial
   Intelligence in Military Affairs in the United States and the People's
   Republic of China
SO FOREIGN POLICY ANALYSIS
LA English
DT Article
ID DEFENSE; GERMANY; BALANCE
AB The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in military affairs is largely limited to logistics, transport, reconnaissance, and other support functions at present. Yet, the United States and the People's Republic of China (PRC) are also making significant progress in developing autonomous combat vehicles and other offensive applications of AI. The ambiguous nature and multifaceted applications of AI in military affairs could be seen as either increasing or decreasing the relative cost of offensive military action. The critical question, therefore, is not a technical determination of whether the emerging uses of AI favor the offensive or defensive force, but rather an assessment of how AI is perceived by policymakers. Similar to the World War I era cult of the offensive, ambiguous emerging technology may drive leaders to focus on the offensive advantages of that technology when expectations of conflict are rising. This paper examines the policy elite discourse surrounding the military applications of AI in both the United States and the PRC between 2014 and 2022. It finds that over this period, elite discussion of the use of AI in military affairs has shifted in both states in ways that indicate more focus on the offensive rather than defensive applications of this emerging technology. While by no means determinative, it is an indicator that perceptions of the offense-defense balance may be moving in a destabilizing direction.
   Actuellement, l'utilisation de l'intelligence artificielle (IA) dans les affaires militaires se limite surtout & agrave; la logistique, au transport, & agrave; la reconnaissance et & agrave; d'autres fonctions support. Pourtant, les & Eacute;tats-Unis et la R & eacute;publique populaire de Chine (RPC) effectuent & eacute;galement des progr & egrave;s non n & eacute;gligeables dans le d & eacute;veloppement de v & eacute;hicules de combat autonomes et d'autres applications offensives de l'IA. L'on pourrait penser que la nature ambigu & euml; et les applications aux multiples facettes de l'IA dans les affaires militaires augmenteraient ou diminueraient le co & ucirc;t relatif de l'action militaire offensive. Aussi est-il d & eacute;cisif non pas de d & eacute;terminer sur le plan technique si les utilisations & eacute;mergentes de l'IA favorisent la force offensive ou d & eacute;fensive, mais plut & ocirc;t d'& eacute;valuer la perception de l'IA par les d & eacute;cideurs politiques. & Agrave; l'instar du culte offensif de la p & eacute;riode de la Premi & egrave;re Guerre mondiale, les technologies & eacute;mergentes ambigu & euml;s peuvent pousser les dirigeants & agrave; se focaliser sur les avantages offensifs de ces technologies quand la possibilit & eacute; d'un conflit augmente. Cet article examine le discours des & eacute;lites politiques concernant les applications militaires de l'IA tant aux & Eacute;tats-Unis qu'en RPC entre 2014 et 2022. Il conclut que durant cette p & eacute;riode, la discussion des & eacute;lites quant & agrave; l'utilisation de l'IA dans les affaires militaires a & eacute;volu & eacute; dans les deux & Eacute;tats d'une fa & ccedil;on qui indique une concentration croissante sur les applications offensives plut & ocirc;t que d & eacute;fensives de cette technologie & eacute;mergente. Bien que nullement d & eacute;terminant, il s'agit d'un indicateur que les perceptions de l'& eacute;quilibre Attaque/D & eacute;fense pourraient tendre dans une direction d & eacute;stabilisatrice.
   En la actualidad, el uso de la inteligencia artificial (IA) en el & aacute;mbito militar est & aacute; limitado, en gran medida, a la log & iacute;stica, al transporte, al reconocimiento y a otras funciones auxiliares. Sin embargo, tanto Estados Unidos como la Rep & uacute;blica Popular China (RPCh) tambi & eacute;n est & aacute;n llevando a cabo progresos significativos con respecto al desarrollo de veh & iacute;culos de combate aut & oacute;nomos y a otras aplicaciones de car & aacute;cter ofensivo que puede ofrecer la IA. Tanto esta naturaleza ambigua como las aplicaciones multifac & eacute;ticas que ofrece la IA en el & aacute;mbito militar pueden considerarse como un aumento o una disminuci & oacute;n del coste relativo de la acci & oacute;n militar ofensiva. En consecuencia, la cuesti & oacute;n relevante no es una determinaci & oacute;n de car & aacute;cter t & eacute;cnico en materia de si los usos emergentes de la IA favorecen la fuerza ofensiva o la defensiva, sino m & aacute;s bien un an & aacute;lisis de c & oacute;mo los responsables pol & iacute;ticos perciben la IA. Al igual que sucedi & oacute; con el culto a la ofensiva que tuvo lugar durante la era de la Primera Guerra Mundial, la ambigua tecnolog & iacute;a emergente puede llevar a los l & iacute;deres a centrarse en las ventajas ofensivas de esa tecnolog & iacute;a cuando las expectativas de que tenga lugar un conflicto est & aacute;n aumentando. Este art & iacute;culo estudia el discurso por parte de la & eacute;lite pol & iacute;tica con respecto a las aplicaciones militares de la IA tanto en EE. UU. como en la RPCh entre 2014 y 2022. El art & iacute;culo concluye que, durante este per & iacute;odo, el debate que tuvo lugar entre las & eacute;lites con respecto al uso de la IA en el & aacute;mbito militar ha cambiado en ambos Estados de manera que indica que ha habido un mayor enfoque sobre las aplicaciones ofensivas que sobre las aplicaciones defensivas de esta tecnolog & iacute;a emergente. Si bien esto no es, de ninguna manera, determinante, es un indicador de que las percepciones del equilibrio entre ataque y defensa pueden estar movi & eacute;ndose en una direcci & oacute;n desestabilizadora.

AB A discussion forum is a valuable tool to support student learning in online contexts. However, interactions in online discussion forums are sparse, leading to other issues such as low engagement and dropping out. Recent educational studies have examined the affordances of conversational agents (CA) powered by artificial intelligence (AI) to automatically support student participation in discussion forums. However, few studies have paid attention to the safety of CAs. This study aimed to address the safety challenges of CAs constructed with educational big data to support learning. Specifically, we proposed a safety-aware CA model, benchmarked with two state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, to support high school student learning in an online algebra learning platform. We applied automatic text analysis to evaluate the safety and socio-emotional support levels of CA-generated and human-generated texts. A large dataset was used to train and evaluate the CA models, which consisted of all discussion post-reply pairs (n = 2,097,139) by 71,918 online math learners from 2015 to 2021. Results show that while SOTA models can generate supportive texts, their safety is compromised. Meanwhile, our proposed model can effectively enhance the safety of generated texts while providing comparable support.

ID LOGIC LOCKING
AB Reverse engineering (RE) of hardware designs poses a significant threat to the modern distributed electronics supply chain. RE can be performed at both chip and printed circuit board (PCB) levels by using structural, functional, or combined analysis techniques. Recent studies on artificial intelligence (AI)-inspired RE techniques have seen a drastic increase in the effectiveness of such attacks. While various countermeasures, e.g., logic locking (LL) at the chip level and camouflaging at the board level, have been studies to combat RE, the advent of Boolean satisfiability (SAT)-based functional query at chip level and 3-D imaging attacks at board level has shown that these protections can be easily bypassed. We observe that a common factor that contributes to the success of these attacks at both chip and board levels is the ability of an attacker to observe the input/output (I/O) patterns of a working system. Based on this observation, we present a novel locking scheme called that can effectively prevent access to golden I/O behavior of a working system. restricts access to the actual I/Os of the chips in a PCB by introducing a low-overhead key management unit (KMU) that works in conjunction with internal encryption/decryption modules near the I/O ports. The encryption/decryption modules are designed to work with the existing joint test action group (JTAG) infrastructure. can be used in standalone mode or in conjunction with another LL scheme to enhance the overall security of the design. We evaluate the security guarantees offered by theoretically, through simulation, and hardware measurements. We show that provides robust protection against both chip-level and PCB-level RE attacks while incurring minimal design overhead.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB Smart grid (SG) systems are designed to leverage digital automation technologies for monitoring, control and analysis. As SG technology is implemented in increasing number of power systems, SG data becomes increasingly vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Classic analytic physics-model based bad data detection methods may not detect these attacks. Recently, physics-model and data-driven methods have been proposed to use the temporal aspect of the data to learn multivariate statistics of the SG such as mean and covariance matrices of voltages, power flows etc., and then make decisions based on fixed values of these statistics. However, as loads and generation change within a system, these statistics may change rapidly. In this study, an adaptive data-driven anomaly detection framework, Ensemble CorrDet with Adaptive Statistics (ECD-AS), is proposed to detect false data injection cyber-attacks under a constantly changing system state. ECD-AS is tested on the IEEE 118-bus system for 15 different sets of training and test datasets for a variety of current state-of-the-art bad data detection strategies. Experimental results show that the proposed ECD-AS solution outperforms the related strategies due to its unique ability to capture and account for rapidly changing statistics in SG.

AB In this study hyperspectral imaging (380-1020 nm) and machine learning were utilised to develop a technique for detecting different disease development stages (asymptomatic, early, intermediate, and late disease stage) of powdery mildew (PM) in squash. Data were collected in the laboratory as well as in the field using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Radial basis function (RBF) was used to discriminate between healthy and diseased plants, and to classify the severity level (disease stage) of a plant; the most significant bands to differentiate between healthy and different stages of disease development were selected (388 nm, 591 nm, 646 nm, 975 nm, and 1012 nm). Furthermore, 29 spectral vegetation indices (VIs) were tested and evaluated for their ability to detect and classify healthy and PM-infected plants; the M value was used to evaluate the VIs. The water index (WI) and the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) were able to accurately detect and classify PM in asymptomatic, early, and late development stages under laboratory conditions. Under field conditions (UAV-based), the spectral ratio of 761 (SR761) accurately detected PM in early stages, and the chlorophyll index green (CI green), the normalised difference of 750/705 (ND 750/705), the green normalised difference vegetation index (GNDVI), and the spectral ratio of 850 (SR850) in late stages. The classification results, by using RBF, in laboratory conditions for the asymptomatic and late stage was 82% and 99% respectively, while in field conditions it was 89% and 96% in early and late disease development stages, respectively.

AB Middle School students in the United States are exposed to an unprecedented number of AI-driven consumer products. This exposure demands that educators help students develop their personal understandings of these technologies to engage with them responsibly. Designing age-appropriate AI curricula for middle school students calls for collaboration and partnership between computer and learning scientists, as well as middle school teachers. Over a 3-year period, we co-designed and successfully implemented an AI education curriculum across 9 geographically and economically diverse schools, offering it to a total of 1551 students. Drawing from our analyses of the curriculum and teacher and student experiences, we propose an effective format for teaching, assessing, and implementing fundamental AI education for middle school settings in the United States. Our research also highlights the value of empowering teachers through co-design; enriching their professional development and improving students' AI literacy.

AB Ongoing advancements in generative AI (GenAI) have boosted the potential of applying long-standing "learning-by-teaching" practices in the form of a teachable agent (TA). Despite the recognized roles and opportunities of TAs, less is known about how GenAI could create synergy or introduce challenges in TAs and how students perceived the application of GenAI in TAs. This study explored middle school students' perceived roles, benefits, and challenges of GenAI-powered TAs in an authentic mathematics classroom. Through classroom observation, focus-group interviews, and open-ended surveys of 108 sixth-grade students, we found that students expected the GenAI-powered TA to serve as a learning companion, facilitator, and collaborative problem-solver. Students also expressed the benefits and challenges of GenAI-powered TAs. This study provides implications for the design of educational AI and AI-assisted instruction.

AB Genotype imputation is a foundational tool for population genetics. Standard statistical imputation approaches rely on the co-location of large whole-genome sequencing-based reference panels, powerful computing environments, and potentially sensitive genetic study data. This results in computational resource and privacy-risk barriers to access to cutting-edge imputation techniques. Moreover, the accuracy of current statistical approaches is known to degrade in regions of low and complex linkage disequilibrium. Artificial neural network-based imputation approaches may overcome these limitations by encoding complex genotype relationships in easily portable inference models. Here, we demonstrate an autoencoder-based approach for genotype imputation, using a large, commonly used reference panel, and spanning the entirety of human chromosome 22. Our autoencoder-based genotype imputation strategy achieved superior imputation accuracy across the allele-frequency spectrum and across genomes of diverse ancestry, while delivering at least fourfold faster inference run time relative to standard imputation tools.

AB Compared to the booming industry of AIMDSS, the usage of AIMDSS among healthcare professionals is relatively low in the hospital. Thus, a research on the acceptance and adoption intention of AIMDSS by health professionals is imperative. In this study, an integration of Unified theory of user acceptance of technology and trust theory is proposed for exploring the adoption of AIMDSS. Besides, two groups of additional factors, related to AIMDSS (task complexity, technology characteristics, and perceived substitution crisis) and health professionals' characteristics (propensity to trust and personal innovativeness in IT) are considered in the integrated model. The data set of proposed research model is collected through paper survey and Internet survey in China. The empirical examination demonstrates a high predictive power of this proposed model in explaining AIMDSS adoption. Finally, the theoretical contribution and practical implications of this research are discussed.

TI An artificial intelligence approach of feature engineering and ensemble

AB Genetic selection has remarkably helped U.S. dairy farms to decrease their carbon footprint by more than doubling milk production per cow over time. Despite the environmental and economic benefits of improved feed and milk production efficiency, there is a critical need to explore phenotypical variance for feed utilization to advance the long-term sustainability of dairy farms. Feed is a major expense in dairy operations, and their enteric fermentation is a major source of greenhouse gases in agriculture. The challenges to expanding the phenotypic database, especially for feed efficiency predictions, and the lack of understanding of its drivers limit its utilization. Herein, we leveraged an artificial intelligence approach with feature engineering and ensemble methods to explore the predictive power of the rumen microbiome for feed and milk production efficiency traits, as rumen microbes play a central role in physiological responses in dairy cows. The novel ensemble method allowed to further identify key microbes linked to the efficiency measures. We used a population of 454 genotyped Holstein cows in the U.S. and Canada with individually measured feed and milk production efficiency phenotypes. The study underscored that the rumen microbiome is a major driver of residual feed intake (RFI), the most robust feed efficiency measure evaluated in the study, accounting for 36% of its variation. Further analyses showed that several alpha-diversity metrics were lower in more feed-efficient cows. For RFI, [Ruminococcus] gauvreauii group was the only genus positively associated with an improved feed efficiency status while seven other taxa were associated with inefficiency. The study also highlights that the rumen microbiome is pivotal for the unexplained variance in milk fat and protein production efficiency. Estimation of the carbon footprint of these cows shows that selection for better RFI could reduce up to 5 kg of diet consumed per cow daily, potentially reducing up to 37.5% of CH4. These findings shed light that the integration of artificial intelligence approaches, microbiology, and ruminant nutrition can be a path to further advance our understanding of the rumen microbiome on nutrient requirements and lactation performance of dairy cows to support the long-term sustainability of the dairy community.

AB Text-based automatic personality recognition (APR) operates at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and psychology to determine the personality of an individual from their text sample. This covert form of personality assessment is key for a variety of online applications that contribute to individual convenience and well-being such as that of chatbots and personal assistants. Despite the availability of good quality data utilizing state-of-the-art AI methods, the reported performance of these recognition systems remains below expectations in comparable areas. Consequently, this work investigates and identifies the source of this performance limit and attributes it to the flawed assumptions of text-based APR. These insights are obtained via a large-scale comprehensive benchmark and analysis of text data from five corpora with diverse characteristics and complementary personality models (Big Five and Dark Triad) applied to an assortment of AI methods ranging from hand-crafted linguistic features to data-driven transformers. Finally, the work concludes by identifying the open problems that can help navigate the limitations in text-based automatic personality recognition to a great extent.

DE Virtual reality; immersive; geography; higher education; learning
AB This systematic review examines the empirical research conducted in the past decade to investigate the application of immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) in geography higher education. Our analysis includes 29 empirical studies published across 25 peer-reviewed articles and delves into IVR applications from four key perspectives: the temporal and spatial distribution of studies and specific devices used, the subdomains of geography in which IVR is applied, the research methodologies employed, and the impact on learning outcomes and experiences. The review highlights the emergence of IVR in geography higher education from 2015. There was a notable surge in studies between 2020 and 2022, predominantly conducted in Europe and the United States. The primary focus of these studies was on topics related to physical geography. Research methodologies are well-balanced among these studies, incorporating a mix of quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods. The majority of these studies reported positive effects on learning outcomes and experiences, although some noted side effects like motion sickness. Future research should integrate reliability, validity, and fairness testing, link to learning theories in instructional design, and explore the application of advanced machine learning or artificial intelligence models.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI), since its marked proliferation in the mid-2010s, has significantly penetrated various sectors, becoming a transformative force that necessitates ongoing refinement of communication strategies and political dynamics by stakeholders. Drawing on the Orientation-Stimulus-Reasoning-Orientation-Response (O-S-R-O-R) model, this study delves into the role of AI news consumption in participatory democracy. Using data from a nationwide survey (N = 1,252), the study assesses a mediation model that proposes a multilayered process through which AI news consumption facilitates civic participation. The findings reveal that AI news consumption across different media platforms is positively linked with civic participation, facilitated by both online and offline AI discussions. This relationship is further mediated by trust in AI news and trust in AI actors. Further theoretical and practical implications are also discussed.

ID BUILDINGS; CONSUMPTION
AB In developed countries, buildings are involved in almost 50% of total energy use and 30% of global annual greenhouse gas emissions. The operational energy needs of buildings are highly dependent on various building physical, operational, and functional characteristics, as well as meteorological and temporal properties. Besides physics-based energy modeling of buildings, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the capability to provide faster and higher accuracy estimates, given buildings' historic energy consumption data. Looking beyond individual building levels, forecasting building energy performance can help city and community managers have a better understanding of their future energy needs, and to plan for satisfying them more efficiently. Focusing at an urban scale, this research develops a campus energy use prediction tool for predicting the effects of long-term climate change on the energy performance of buildings using AI techniques. The tool comprises four steps: Data Collection, AI Development, Model Validation, and Model Implementation, and can predict the energy use of campus buildings with 90% accuracy. We have relied on energy use data of buildings situated in the University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida (FL). To study the impact of climate change, we have used climate properties of three future weather files of Gainesville, FL, developed by the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP), represented based on their impact: median (year 2063), hottest (2057), and coldest (2041).

AB Plasma half-life is a crucial pharmacokinetic parameter for estimating extralabel withdrawal intervals of drugs to ensure the safety of food products derived from animals. This study focuses on developing a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model incorporating multiple machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms, and aims to predict the plasma half-lives of drugs in 6 food animals, including cattle, chickens, goats, sheep, swine, and turkeys. By integrating 4 machine learning algorithms with 5 molecular descriptor types, 20 QSAR models were developed using data from the Food Animal Residue Avoidance Databank (FARAD) Comparative Pharmacokinetic Database. The deep neural network (DNN) algorithm demonstrated the best prediction ability of plasma half-lives. The DNN model with all descriptors achieved superior performance with a high coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.82 +/- 0.19 in 5-fold cross-validation on the training sets and an R2 of 0.67 on the independent test set, indicating accurate predictions and good generalizability. The final model was converted to a user-friendly web dashboard to facilitate its wide application by the scientific community. This machine learning-based QSAR model serves as a valuable tool for predicting drug plasma half-lives and extralabel withdrawal intervals in 6 common food animals based on physicochemical properties. It also provides a foundation to develop more advanced models to predict the tissue half-life of drugs in food animals.

TI Pharmacists' perceptions of artificial intelligence: A national survey
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing and evolving field impacting pharmacy research, education, and professional practice. The development and adaptation of AI technologies have the potential to radically shape the future of the pharmacy profession. However, it remains unclear how aware pharmacists are of these technologies or their perceptions regarding current and future utilization. Objective: The purpose of this study is to describe the perceptions and awareness of artificial intelligence technologies in a population of practicing pharmacists across the United States. Methods: A 19-question electronic survey was administered via Qualtrics to assess various AI perceptions among U.S. pharmacists. The survey ran from September 5th to November 22nd, 2023 and targeted practicing pharmacists through professional organizations and publicly available email lists. Responses were analyzed for descriptive trends and demographic analysis focusing on factors predicting AI use and were categorized into sub-focuses for detailed analysis. Results: A total of 1363 practicing pharmacists completed the survey. 82.5% of respondents expressed some degree of familiarity with AI software, but only 38.7% reported having used AI. Of those using AI software, the most common applications were Large Language Models (33.7%) and Image Generation (10%). 56.1% of pharmacists feel that AI will decrease the number of pharmacy jobs, and 34.9% of pharmacists express some degree of distrust of AI. Despite this, 64.1% of pharmacists feel that AI could enhance their professional effectiveness and productivity. Males appear much more likely than females to use AI (50.1% Vs. 31%, P < .001). Younger responders also reported higher AI utilization with the highest utilization aged 23e29 (47.5%) and lowest in 60 & thorn; (25.6%, P < .001) Conclusion: Understanding pharmacists' current awareness, concerns, and perspectives on AI is crucial for navigating its potential impact on the profession including potential professional utilization, addressing concerns regarding job security, ethical considerations, and regulatory uncertainty.

AB The objective of this study is to use a deep-learning model based on CNN architecture to detect the second mesiobuccal (MB2) canals, which are seen as a variation in maxillary molars root canals. In the current study, 922 axial sections from 153 patients' cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images were used. The segmentation method was employed to identify the MB2 canals in maxillary molars that had not previously had endodontic treatment. Labeled images were divided into training (80%), validation (10%) and testing (10%) groups. The artificial intelligence (AI) model was trained using the You Only Look Once v5 (YOLOv5x) architecture with 500 epochs and a learning rate of 0.01. Confusion matrix and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were used in the statistical evaluation of the results. The sensitivity of the MB2 canal segmentation model was 0.92, the precision was 0.83, and the F1 score value was 0.87. The area under the curve (AUC) in the ROC graph of the model was 0.84. The mAP value at 0.5 inter-over union (IoU) was found as 0.88. The deep-learning algorithm used showed a high success in the detection of the MB2 canal. The success of the endodontic treatment can be increased and clinicians' time can be preserved using the newly created artificial intelligence-based models to identify variations in root canal anatomy before the treatment.

SO WORLD JOURNAL OF UROLOGY

DT Article
DE Artificial intelligence; Chatbot; Medical question; Kidney stone
AB PurposeArtificial intelligence (AI) technology will inevitably permeate healthcare. Bing Chat is an AI chatbot with different conservation styles. We evaluated each of these response mode answers regarding management of nephrolithiasis.MethodsA total of 20 questions were created based on the AUA Surgical Management of Stones guidelines. Bing Chat's responses were evaluated across Precise, Balanced, and Creative conversation style chat modes by three physicians using the Brief DISCERN tool. Consensus scoring was employed to assess appropriateness, guideline adherence, empathy, recommendation for physician consultation, and inability to answer the inquiry. Responses were also assessed for their directness and the presence of superfluous information. Chat modes were compared using descriptive statistics as well as ANOVA, Chi-Squared tests, and Fisher exact tests.ResultsThe median Brief DISCERN Score in Precise, Balanced, and Creative modes were: 22, 21, and 21, respectively. There was no significant difference in Brief DISCERN scores between the three chat modes (p = 0.68). Guideline adherence by chatbot conversation style was similar (p = 0.37), as was response appropriateness (p = 0.62), directly answering the question asked (p = 0.26) and providing a recommendation to consult with a healthcare provider (p = 0.07). Creative and balanced modes outperformed precise mode when evaluating response empathy. Creative mode was more likely to include superfluous information and less likely to answer the question.ConclusionIn its current iteration, Bing Chat provides low quality urologic healthcare information for nephrolithiasis queries, regardless of the conversation style utilized.

AB Today's research on human-robot teaming requires the ability to test artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for perception and decision-making in complex real-world environments. Field experiments, also referred to as experiments "in the wild," do not provide the level of detailed ground truth necessary for thorough performance comparisons and validation. Experiments on pre-recorded real-world data sets are also significantly limited in their usefulness because they do not allow researchers to test the effectiveness of active robot perception and control or decision strategies in the loop. Additionally, research on large human-robot teams requires tests and experiments that are too costly even for the industry and may result in considerable time losses when experiments go awry. The novel Real-Time Human Autonomous Systems Collaborations (RealTHASC) facility at Cornell University interfaces real and virtual robots and humans with photorealistic simulated environments by implementing new concepts for the seamless integration of wearable sensors, motion capture, physics-based simulations, robot hardware and virtual reality (VR). The result is an extended reality (XR) testbed by which real robots and humans in the laboratory are able to experience virtual worlds, inclusive of virtual agents, through real-time visual feedback and interaction. VR body tracking by DeepMotion is employed in conjunction with the OptiTrack motion capture system to transfer every human subject and robot in the real physical laboratory space into a synthetic virtual environment, thereby constructing corresponding human/robot avatars that not only mimic the behaviors of the real agents but also experience the virtual world through virtual sensors and transmit the sensor data back to the real human/robot agent, all in real time. New cross-domain synthetic environments are created in RealTHASC using Unreal Engine (TM), bridging the simulation-to-reality gap and allowing for the inclusion of underwater/ground/aerial autonomous vehicles, each equipped with a multi-modal sensor suite. The experimental capabilities offered by RealTHASC are demonstrated through three case studies showcasing mixed real/virtual human/robot interactions in diverse domains, leveraging and complementing the benefits of experimentation in simulation and in the real world.

ID OPTICAL CAVITIES
AB Active mode mismatch sensing and control can facilitate optimal coupling in optical cavity experiments such as interferometric gravitational wave detectors. In this paper, we demonstrate a radio-frequency (RF) beam wavefront curvature modulation-based mode mismatch sensing scheme inspired by the previously proposed RF beam jitter alignment sensing scheme. The proposed mode mismatch sensing scheme uses an electro-optic lens (EOL) device that is designed to provide the required beam wavefront curvature actuation, as well as a mode converting telescope that rephases the RF second-order modes and generates a non-vanishing mode mismatch sensing signal. We carefully investigate the total second-order mode generation from the wavefront actuation both analytically and numerically, taking the effects of Gaussian beam size evolution and the second-order mode phase mismatch cancellation into consideration. We demonstrate the second-order mode generation as a function of the incident beam waist size and the electro-optic crystal size which, along with a "trade-off" consideration of the beam size at the edges of the crystal and the clipping loss, provides us with guidance for designing the beam profile that interacts with the crystal to improve the EOL modulation efficiency.

AB Yield prediction of citrus provides critical information before harvest to growers and allied industry to predict the resources required for workers, storage, and transportation of the harvest. In this study, three machine learning (ML) based models were developed for tree-level citrus yield prediction: (i) Model-1 utilized UAV imagery; (ii) Model-2 utilized UAV imagery and ground-based fruit detection and counts from images taken from one side of the tree; and (iii) Model-3 utilized UAV imagery and ground-based fruit detection and counts from images taken from two sides of the tree. The UAV images were used as input to a novel cloud-based technology, Agroview, to get the tree health, height, and canopy area information. The multispectral bands and the tree structural parameters were the input for Model-1. Two images per tree were captured from the ground using an RGB camera (one from each side) and were used for fruit count using an object detection algorithm, YOLOv3. Harvest data was collected manually per tree (fruit count and weight). Four ML algorithms - gradient boosting regression (GBR), random forest regression (RFR), linear regression (LR), and partial least squares regression (PLSR) were used to generate the models. Model-2 (MAPE of 23.45%) performed similarly to Model-3 (MAPE of 25.72%) and significantly better than Model-1 (MAPE of 35.59%). Model-2 was selected as the best model because of its low MAPE value in predicting yield at the tree level, and data collection simplicity (compared to Model-3).

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning have been increasingly adopted for travel demand forecasting. The AI-based travel demand forecasting models, though generate accurate predictions, may produce prediction biases and raise fairness issues. Using such biased models for decision-making may lead to transportation policies that exacerbate social inequalities. However, limited studies have been focused on addressing the fairness issues of these models. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel methodology to develop fairness-aware, highly-accurate travel demand forecasting models. Particularly, the proposed methodology can enhance the fairness of AI models for multiple protected attributes (such as race and income) simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a new fairness regularization term, which is explicitly designed to measure the correlation between prediction accuracy and multiple protected attributes, into the loss function of the travel demand forecasting model. We conduct two case studies to evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology using real-world ridesourcing-trip data in Chicago, IL and Austin, TX, respectively. Results highlight that our proposed methodology can effectively enhance fairness for multiple protected attributes while preserving prediction accuracy. Additionally, we have compared our methodology with three state-of-the-art methods that adopt the regularization term approach, and the results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms them in both preserving prediction accuracy and enhancing fairness. This study can provide transportation professionals with a new tool to achieve fair and accurate travel demand forecasting.

AB Camera trapping is the most widely used data collection method for estimating snow leopard (Panthera uncia) abundance; however, the accuracy of this method is limited by human observer errors from misclassifying individuals in camera trap images. We evaluated the extent Whiskerbook (www.whiskerbook.org), an artificial intelligence (AI) software, could reduce this error rate and enhance the accuracy of capture-recapture abundance estimates. Using 439 images of 34 captive snow leopard individuals, classification was performed by five observers with prior experience in individual snow leopard ID ( "experts ") and five observers with no such experience ( "novices "). The "expert " observers classified 35 out of 34 snow leopard individuals, on average erroneously splitting one individual into two, thus resulting in a higher number than true individuals. The success rate of experts was 90 %, with less than a 3 % error in estimating the population size in capture-recapture modeling. However, the "novice " observers successfully matched 71 % of encounters, recognizing 25 out of 34 individuals, underestimating the population by 25 %. It was found that expert observers significantly outperformed novice observers, making statistically fewer errors (Mann Whitney U test P = 0.01) and finding the true number of individuals (P = 0.01). These differences were contrasted with a previous study by Johansson et al. 2020, using the same subset of 16 individuals from European zoos. With the help of AI and the Whiskerbook platform, "experts " were able to match 87 % of encounters and identify 15 out of 16 individuals, with modeled estimates of 16 +/- 1 individuals. In contrast, "novices " were 63 % accurate in matching encounters and identified 12 out of 16 individuals, modeling 12 +/- 1 individuals that underestimated the population size by 12 %. When comparing the performance of observers using AI and the Whiskerbook platform to observers performing the tasks manually, we found that observers using Whiskerbook made significantly fewer errors in splitting one individual into two (P = 0.04). However, there were also a significantly higher number of combination errors, where two individuals were combined into one (P = 0.01). Specifically, combination errors were found to be made by "novices " (P = 0.04). Although AI benefited both expert and novice observers, expert observers outperformed novices. Our results suggest that AI effectively reduced the misclassification of individual snow leopards in camera trap studies, improving abundance estimates. However, even with AI support, expert observers were needed to obtain the most accurate estimates.

AB Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are injuries that can result from or are worsened by performing work-related tasks. Approximately 1.7 billion people suffer from MSDs globally. Thus, strategies are needed to improve postural behaviors. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of video feedback using an AI-powered application to improve participants' low-risk neck positioning while completing an analog work task. Ten undergraduate students completed the analog work task in a simulated office environment. The researchers provided video feedback in a multiple baseline design across participants and the results showed that low-risk neck positioning increased when video feedback was provided. Additionally, the researchers conducted two validation tests comparing the ergonomic measurements produced by the AI-powered app to measurements produced by a gold-standard sensor-based ergonomic measurement system. The results of the validation tests provide preliminary support for the accuracy and reliability of the AI-powered app's ergonomic measurements.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) is a thriving research field with many successful applications in areas such as computer vision and speech recognition. Machine learning methods, such as artificial neural networks (ANN), play a central role in modern AI technology. While ANN also holds great promise for human genetic research, the high-dimensional genetic data and complex genetic structure bring tremendous challenges. The vast majority of genetic variants on the genome have small or no effects on diseases, and fitting ANN on a large number of variants without considering the underlying genetic structure (e.g., linkage disequilibrium) could bring a serious overfitting issue. Furthermore, while a single disease phenotype is often studied in a classic genetic study, in emerging research fields (e.g., imaging genetics), researchers need to deal with different types of disease phenotypes. To address these challenges, we propose a functional neural networks (FNN) method. FNN uses a series of basis functions to model high-dimensional genetic data and a variety of phenotype data and further builds a multi-layer functional neural network to capture the complex relationships between genetic variants and disease phenotypes. Through simulations, we demonstrate the advantages of FNN for high-dimensional genetic data analysis in terms of robustness and accuracy. The real data applications also showed that FNN attained higher accuracy than the existing methods.

AB With the unceasing advancement of novel digital technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) is projected to change and challenge established social dynamics. As such, a deeper understanding of AI and its impacts will prove to be crucial in an AI-enriched world. In the current study, we focus on an emerging AI-based technology, deepfakes, and investigate the effects of a lesser-known use of deepfakes (i.e., using deepfakes for prosocial purposes). Specifically, we examine the impacts of exposure to a "deepfake resurrection" narrative on individuals' policy support and activism intentions in two contexts (i.e., drunk driving and domestic violence). We conducted a between-subjects experiment (N = 1990) that varied in the use (vs. non-use) of deepfakes and tested four psy-chological processes related to the effects of deepfake resurrection narratives. While the moderating role of point of view and the mediating role of perceived desecration of the dead did not receive much support, the narrative-based and the surprise-focused mediational pathways were shown to be important mechanisms of deepfake resurrection narratives. Finally, we reflect on the potential of prosocial deepfakes and deepfake resurrection narratives and discuss the findings' relevance to both theory and practice.

AB As the prevalence of AI-generated content increases, examining viewers' perceptions of the content is crucial to understanding the human-machine relationship and further facilitating efficient human-machine collaboration. Prior literature has accumulated mixed findings regarding subjects' attitudes toward and perceptions of news and tweets written by natural language generation (NLG) algorithms. To resolve this inconsistency and expand our understanding beyond NLG, this study investigated the explicit and implicit perceptions of AI-generated poetry and painting held by subjects from two societies. An experimental survey was conducted to examine the subjects' explicit and implicit perceptions of AI-generated content in the U.S. and China. As the U.S. and China fiercely compete to lead the development of AI technology, their citizens exhibit divergent attitudes toward AI's performance in artistic work. The U.S. subjects were more critical of the AI-than the human-generated content, both explicitly and implicitly. Although the Chinese subjects were overtly positive about the AI-generated content, they appreciated less this content than the human-authored content. The findings enrich our understanding in the domain of AI generation. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB Predictive maintenance of built assets often relies on scheduled routine practices that are disconnected from real-time stress assessment, degradation and defects. However, while Digital Twin (DT) technology within building and urban studies is maturing rapidly, its use in predictive maintenance is limited. Traditional preventive and reactive maintenance strategies that are more prevalent in facility management are not intuitive, not resource efficient, cannot prevent failure and either underserve the asset or are surplus to requirements. City Information Modeling (CIM) refers to a federation of BIM models in accordance with real-world geospatial references, and it can be deployed as an Urban Digital Twin (UDT) at city level, like BIM's deployment at building level. This study presents a systematic review of 105 Scopus-indexed papers to establish current trends, gaps and opportunities for a cognitive predictive maintenance framework in the architecture, engineering, construction and operations (AECO) industry. A UDT framework consisting of the CIM of a section of the University of Florida campus is proposed to bridge the knowledge gap highlighted in the systematic review. The framework illustrates the potential for CNN-IoT integration to improve predictive maintenance through advance notifications. It also eliminates the use of centralized information archiving.

AB As organizations increasingly adopt artificial intelligence (AI) systems for their online communication with publics, conceptualizing and operationalizing perceived humanness presents an important challenge to understanding how consumers and other publics respond to both AI and human agents in live chats with organizations. This study develops a measure of consumer-perceived humanness derived from three related constructs: conversational human voice, anthropomorphism, and social presence. The new measure was tested for reliability and validity, including tests of criterion validity predicting how it would relate to perceived relational investment and trust as relational outcomes. Two online studies (N-1 = 172, N-2 = 375) were conducted in which participants interacted with either human or machine online chat agents. Greater perceived humanness of chat agents was found to correlate with greater perceived relational investment and trust in the organization, with perceived relational investment mediating the relationship between perceived humanness and trust. Perceived humanness can be utilized subsequently to assess both human and machine agents. Its corollary, perceived machineness, was also identified as a separate factor to be taken into consideration in future research and theory building.

AB Topological relationships between spatial objects in the two-dimensional space have been investigated for a long time in a number of disciplines like artificial intelligence, cognitive science, linguistics, and robotics. In the context of spatial databases and geographical information systems, as predicates they especially support the design of suitable query languages for spatial data retrieval and analysis. But so far, they have only been defined for simplified abstractions of spatial objects like continuous lines and simple regions. With the introduction of complex spatial data types in spatial data models and extensions of commercial database systems, an issue arises regarding the design, definition, and number of topological relationships operating on these complex types. This paper first introduces a formally defined, conceptual model of general and versatile spatial data types for complex lines and complex regions. Based on the well known 9-intersection model, it then formally determines the complete set of mutually exclusive topological relationships between complex lines and complex regions. Completeness and mutual exclusion are shown by a proof technique called proof-by-constraint-and-drawing.

AB BACKGROUND: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) in conjunction with recent updates in dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) management guidelines emphasizes the necessity for innovative models to predict ischemic or bleeding events after drug-eluting stent implantation. Leveraging AI for dynamic prediction has the potential to revolutionize risk stratification and provide personalized decision support for DAPT management.
   METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed and validated a new AI-based pipeline using retrospective data of drug-eluting stent-treated patients, sourced from the Cerner Health Facts data set (n=98 236) and Optum's de-identified Clinformatics Data Mart Database (n=9978). The 36 months following drug-eluting stent implantation were designated as our primary forecasting interval, further segmented into 6 sequential prediction windows. We evaluated 5 distinct AI algorithms for their precision in predicting ischemic and bleeding risks. Model discriminative accuracy was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, among other metrics. The weighted light gradient boosting machine stood out as the preeminent model, thus earning its place as our AI-DAPT model. The AI-DAPT demonstrated peak accuracy in the 30 to 36 months window, charting an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 90% [95% CI, 88%-92%] for ischemia and 84% [95% CI, 82%-87%] for bleeding predictions.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our AI-DAPT excels in formulating iterative, refined dynamic predictions by assimilating ongoing updates from patients' clinical profiles, holding value as a novel smart clinical tool to facilitate optimal DAPT duration management with high accuracy and adaptability.

AB Objective: To summarize how artificial intelligence (AI) is being applied in COVID-19 research and determine whether these AI applications integrated heterogenous data from different sources for modeling.
   Materials and Methods: We searched 2 major COVID-19 literature databases, the National Institutes of Health's LitCovid and the World Health Organization's COVID-19 database on March 9, 2021. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline, 2 reviewers independently reviewed all the articles in 2 rounds of screening.
   Results: In the 794 studies included in the final qualitative analysis, we identified 7 key COVID-19 research areas in which AI was applied, including disease forecasting, medical imaging-based diagnosis and prognosis, early detection and prognosis (non-imaging), drug repurposing and early drug discovery, social media data analysis, genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data analysis, and other COVID-19 research topics. We also found that there was a lack of heterogenous data integration in these AI applications.
   Discussion: Risk factors relevant to COVID-19 outcomes exist in heterogeneous data sources, including electronic health records, surveillance systems, sociodemographic datasets, and many more. However, most AI applications in COVID-19 research adopted a single-sourced approach that could omit important risk factors and thus lead to biased algorithms. Integrating heterogeneous data for modeling will help realize the full potential of AI algorithms, improve precision, and reduce bias.
   Conclusion: There is a lack of data integration in the AI applications in COVID-19 research and a need for a multilevel AI framework that supports the analysis of heterogeneous data from different sources.

AB Customers may not wish to use an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot after knowing its nonhu-man identity. Based on the inoculation theory, this study explores how to increase customers' willingness to communicate with AI chatbots by adopting a double-sided message strategy after AI's nonhuman identity is disclosed through one field experiment in a hotel and three on -line vignette experiments. Results indicate that a double-sided message strategy enhances cus-tomers' willingness to interact with AI chatbots via the mediating role of perceived authenticity. Furthermore, the study highlights that customers' attitudes toward interacting with AI chatbots are moderated by customer demand types-complaints and inquiries. This study proposes an effective solution to customers' rejection of AI chatbots.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aquatic environments encompass the world's most extensive habitats, rich with sounds produced by a diversity of animals. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is an increasingly accessible remote sensing technology that uses hydrophones to listen to the underwater world and represents an unprecedented, non-invasive method to monitor underwater environments. This information can assist in the delineation of biologically important areas via detection of sound-producing species or characterization of ecosystem type and condition, inferred from the acoustic properties of the local soundscape. At a time when worldwide biodiversity is in significant decline and underwater soundscapes are being altered as a result of anthropogenic impacts, there is a need to document, quantify, and understand biotic sound sources-potentially before they disappear. A significant step toward these goals is the development of a web-based, open-access platform that provides: (1) a reference library of known and unknown biological sound sources (by integrating and expanding existing libraries around the world); (2) a data repository portal for annotated and unannotated audio recordings of single sources and of soundscapes; (3) a training platform for artificial intelligence algorithms for signal detection and classification; and (4) a citizen science-based application for public users. Although individually, these resources are often met on regional and taxa-specific scales, many are not sustained and, collectively, an enduring global database with an integrated platform has not been realized. We discuss the benefits such a program can provide, previous calls for global data-sharing and reference libraries, and the challenges that need to be overcome to bring together bio- and ecoacousticians, bioinformaticians, propagation experts, web engineers, and signal processing specialists (e.g., artificial intelligence) with the necessary support and funding to build a sustainable and scalable platform that could address the needs of all contributors and stakeholders into the future.

AB Objective Our article demonstrates the effectiveness of using a validated framework to create a ChatGPT prompt that generates valid nursing care plan suggestions for one hypothetical older patient with lung cancer.Method This study describes the methodology for creating ChatGPT prompts that generate consistent care plan suggestions and its application for a lung cancer case scenario. After entering a nursing assessment of the patient's condition into ChatGPT, we asked it to generate care plan suggestions. Subsequently, we assessed the quality of the care plans produced by ChatGPT.Results While not all the suggested care plan terms (11 out of 16) utilized standardized nursing terminology, the ChatGPT-generated care plan closely matched the gold standard in scope and nature, correctly prioritizing oxygenation and ventilation needs.Conclusion Using a validated framework prompt to generate nursing care plan suggestions with ChatGPT demonstrates its potential value as a decision support tool for optimizing cancer care documentation.

ID MODEL; CLASSIFICATION; EFFICIENCY; ALGORITHM
AB Yield prediction has long been a valuable tool for farmers seeking to enhance crop production. Among the many ways to predict yield, the integration of machine learning (ML) techniques is becoming more common for refining prediction methodologies. This study highlights the current landscape of remote sensing and ML techniques employed in predicting tree crop yield while also identifying critical gaps and areas for further exploration. Studies with limited datasets for training often use simpler models such as linear regression, while studies with larger datasets use more complex models, including techniques such as deep learning, ensemble methods, and hyperparameter tuning; in these cases, the performance evaluation tends to be more sophisticated. Yield prediction using ML has demonstrated accuracy levels ranging from 50 % to 99 %. Studies using smaller datasets consistently demonstrate higher accuracy rates. While ML techniques can enhance yield prediction, their effectiveness depends on strategic data collection and a multi-factor and multi-method approach. Integration of various data sources, including weather, soil, and plant data, could enhance model resilience and applicability. Enhancing research in this field could be achieved through overcoming challenges in accurate data collection and fostering the development of open datasets. This comprehensive analysis lays the groundwork for future research endeavors aimed at refining and advancing the application of remote sensing and ML techniques in accurately predicting tree crop yield.

   DEFINITION; SYSTOLIC DYSFUNCTION
AB Myocardial dysfunction is common in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Septic disease frequently results in cardiac dysfunction, and sepsis represents the most common cause of admission and death in the ICU. The association between left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction and mortality is not clear for critically ill patients. Conversely, LV diastolic dysfunction (DD) seems increasingly recognized as a factor associated with poor outcomes, not only in sepsis but also more generally in critically ill patients. Despite recent attempts to simplify the diagnosis and grading of DD, this remains relatively complex, with the need to use several echocardiographic parameters. Furthermore, the current guidelines have several intrinsic limitations when applied to the ICU setting. In this manuscript, we discuss the challenges in DD classification when applied to critically ill patients, the importance of left atrial pressure estimates for the management of patients in ICU, and whether the study of cardiac dysfunction spectrum during critical illness may benefit from the integration of left ventricular and left atrial strain data to improve diagnostic accuracy and implications for the treatment and prognosis.
   LV diastolic dysfunction is common in critically ill patients and is associated with poor outcomes. Echocardiography is used to assess LV diastolic function and estimate LV filling pressures. Recent American Society of Echocardiography/European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging guidelines do not account for the specificities of the critically ill patient and are not validated in this population. LV and left atrial speckle tracking indices and artificial intelligence may provide better insight into the classification of DD in the critically ill.---- image

AB Objectives: This study aimed to assess the influence of background color, ceramic shade, translucency, and thickness on the color matching of lithium disilicate restorations and to use a neural network model to predict the optimal parameters for shade matching. Methods: A neural network model was applied to evaluate the effects of lithium disilicate ceramic shade (A1, A2, A3), translucency (HT, M, T, LT), and thickness (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 mm), as well as background color (black, white, enamel and dentin shades A1-D4) on color matching. Color measurements (L*, a*, b*) were obtained using a spectrophotometer (CM-700d, Konica Minolta) in SCI mode. Results: Background color had a significant influence on color matching (p < 0.001, R2 = 0.740). The model explained 71.45% of the variance in final color values, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.8578 units in the CIELab space. SHAP analysis identified initial L* value (42.32%), ceramic thickness (19.51%), and translucency (10.36%) as key predictors. Component-wise, L* had an R-2 of 0.7594, a* had the lowest R-2 (0.5993), and b* performed best (R2 = 0.7848). Conclusion: Background color and ceramic thickness are the most critical factors in minimizing color discrepancies in ceramic restorations. The developed model demonstrates promising potential in predicting the color outcomes of ceramic restorations.

AB Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-driven traits are commonly introduced into tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) in less than a year. Although CRISPR technology is highly suitable for rapid incorporation of new traits into plants with superior breeding backgrounds, the usefulness of these traits must be demonstrated prior to large-scale distribution of any new variety possessing them. The jointless pedicel trait is crucial for stem-free harvest of tomato fruits and is therefore an essential requirement for developing low-labor tomato varieties. We aimed to evaluate the effect of CRISPR-driven jointless pedicel trait on the yield and horticultural traits of fresh-market tomatoes. We conducted field trials during three consecutive seasons using three related genotypes of two elite fresh-market tomatoes, namely a jointed pedicel tomato, a CRISPR-driven jointless pedicel mutant of the jointed pedicel tomato, and a conventionally-bred jointless pedicel near isogenic line (NIL) to the jointed pedicel tomato. Field evaluations confirmed that the total and medium-, large-, or extra-large-size fruit yields of the CRISPR-driven mutants were not statistically different for those corresponding to their backgrounds and that the fruit yield stratified by fruit size might be varied under different growth conditions. We did not observe any negative correlation between the genotype and the fruit/abscission joint detachment force for any of the genotypes under study.

AB Objectives: To assess the accuracy of ChatGPT answers concerning orthodontic clear aligners. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional content analysis of ChatGPT generated responses to queries related to clear aligner treatment (CAT) was undertaken. A total of 111 questions were generated by three orthodontists based on a set of predefined domains and subdomains. The artificial intelligence (AI) -generated (ChatGPT) answers were extracted and their accuracy was determined independently by five orthodontists. The accuracy of answers was assessed using a prepiloted fourpoint scale scoring rubric. Descriptive statistics were performed. Results: The total mean accuracy score for the entire set was 2.6 +/- 1.1. It was noted that 58% of the AI -generated answers were scored as objectively true, 18% were selected facts, 9% were minimal facts, and 15% were false. False claims included the ability of CAT to reduce the need for orthognathic surgery (4.0 +/- 0.0), improve airway function (3.8 +/- 0.5), achieve root parallelism (3.6 +/- 0.5), alleviate sleep apnea (3.8 +/- 0.5), and produce more stable results compared to fixed appliances (3.8 +/- 0.5). Conclusions: The overall level of accuracy of ChatGPT responses to questions concerning CAT was suboptimal and lacked citations to relevant literature. Ability of the software to offer current and precise information was limited. Therefore, clinicians and patients must be mindful of false claims and relevant facts omitted in the answers generated by ChatGPT. (Angle Orthod. 2024;94:263-272.)

TI Rethinking Environmental Disclosure
SO CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID INFORMATION; POLLUTION
AB Twenty years ago, legal scholars and regulators alike were convinced that information-forcing regulations heralded a new era in environmental law. Coming off the success of the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), which seemed to decrease toxic chemical pollution solely by forcing industry to disclose if they released certain chemicals, many called information regulation the third wave of environmental law. New information disclosure policies were enacted and old policies reinvigorated, leading to a plethora of informationbased regulations throughout environmental law. Now, twenty years later, the emergence of big data and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to environmental analysis have only further increased the belief in the benefits of information-forcing approaches. In this time, the central premise that information regulation works to change behavior and improve environmental outcomes has been largely unquestioned. Despite the widespread enthusiasm, after decades of implementation it is increasingly clear that information regulation largely fails to achieve its environmental goals. This Article makes two main contributions. By drawing on quantitative and qualitative case studies of information-forcing regulations, it first answers the question of whether this approach to environmental regulation is effective. It evaluates the success of information-forcing policies, finding that these policies often fail both to change behavior towards improving environmental conditions and to achieve other stated goals. This Article then analyzes the mechanisms behind information forcing in conjunction with these case studies to propose characteristics that determine the success, or failure, of information regulation. It finds that contrary to popular belief, persuasive and economic mechanisms not drive environmental behavior change. Instead, information- forcing regulations with legal mechanisms of action show the most promise and efficacy. Moving beyond sweeping promises of efficiency and transparency to understand the specific characteristics that make these programs successful is essential moving forward into an era of big environmental data.

AB Purpose: Recent developments in the field of artificial intelligence and acoustics have made it possible to objectively monitor cough in clinical and ambulatory settings. We hypothesized that time patterns of objectively measured cough in COVID-19 patients could predict clinical prognosis and help rapidly identify patients at high risk of intubation or death.Methods: One hundred and twenty-three patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were enrolled at University of Florida Health Shands and the Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite acute accent de Montre acute accent al. Patients' cough was continuously monitored digitally along with clinical severity of disease until hospital discharge, intubation, or death. The natural history of cough in hospitalized COVID-19 disease was described and logistic models fitted on cough time patterns were used to predict clinical outcomes.Results: In both cohorts, higher early coughing rates were associated with more favorable clinical outcomes. The transitional cough rate, or maximum cough per hour rate predicting unfavorable outcomes, was 3.40 and the AUC for cough frequency as a predictor of unfavorable outcomes was 0.761. The initial 6 h (0.792) and 24 h (0.719) post-enrolment observation periods confirmed this association and showed similar predictive value.Interpretation: Digital cough monitoring could be used as a prognosis biomarker to predict unfavorable clinical outcomes in COVID-19 disease. With early sampling periods showing good predictive value, this digital biomarker could be combined with clinical and paraclinical evaluation and is well adapted for triaging patients in overwhelmed or resources-limited health programs.

AB The implementation of breeding methods requires the creation of a large and genetically diverse training population. Large-scale experiments are needed for the rapid acquisition of phenotypic data to explore the correlation between genomic and phenotypic information. Traditional sensing technologies for field surveys and field phenotyping rely on manual sampling and are time consuming and labor intensive. Since availability of personnel trained for phenotyping is a major problem, small UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) equipped with various sensors can simplify the surveying procedure, decrease data collection time, and reduce cost. In this study, we evaluated the phenotypic characteristics of sweet orange trees grafted on 25 rootstock cultivars with different influences on plant growth and productivity utilizing a UAV-based high throughput phenotyping system. Data collected by UAV were compared with data collected manually according to standard horticultural procedures. The UAV-based technique was able to detect and count citrus trees with high precision (99.9%) in an orchard of 4931 trees and estimate tree canopy size with a high correlation (R = 0.84) with the manual collected data. No correlation of UAV-based data and manually collected data was observed for yield. The reason for the observed deviation is the influence of different rootstock cultivars on yield efficiency. Despite the low vigor inducing effect of some rootstocks, they are highly productive, whilst others are high in vigor but produce less fruit. Our study demonstrates the high accuracy of the UAV technique to assess tree size. When using these techniques, it is essential to recognize the limitations imposed by the biological system.

AB Through a community-driven competition, the PANDA challenge provides a curated diverse dataset and a catalog of models for prostate cancer pathology, and represents a blueprint for evaluating AI algorithms in digital pathology.
   Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promise for diagnosing prostate cancer in biopsies. However, results have been limited to individual studies, lacking validation in multinational settings. Competitions have been shown to be accelerators for medical imaging innovations, but their impact is hindered by lack of reproducibility and independent validation. With this in mind, we organized the PANDA challenge-the largest histopathology competition to date, joined by 1,290 developers-to catalyze development of reproducible AI algorithms for Gleason grading using 10,616 digitized prostate biopsies. We validated that a diverse set of submitted algorithms reached pathologist-level performance on independent cross-continental cohorts, fully blinded to the algorithm developers. On United States and European external validation sets, the algorithms achieved agreements of 0.862 (quadratically weighted kappa, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.840-0.884) and 0.868 (95% CI, 0.835-0.900) with expert uropathologists. Successful generalization across different patient populations, laboratories and reference standards, achieved by a variety of algorithmic approaches, warrants evaluating AI-based Gleason grading in prospective clinical trials.

AB Facing the escalating effects of climate change, it is critical to improve the prediction and understanding of the hurricane evacuation decisions made by households in order to enhance emergency management. Current studies in this area often have relied on psychology-driven linear models, which frequently exhibited limitations in practice. The present study proposed a novel interpretable machine learning approach to predict household-level evacuation decisions by leveraging easily accessible demographic and resource-related predictors, compared to existing models that mainly rely on psychological factors. An enhanced logistic regression model (that is, an interpretable machine learning approach) was developed for accurate predictions by automatically accounting for nonlinearities and interactions (that is, univariate and bivariate threshold effects). Specifically, nonlinearity and interaction detection were enabled by low-depth decision trees, which offer transparent model structure and robustness. A survey dataset collected in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, two of the most intense tropical storms of the last two decades, was employed to test the new methodology. The findings show that, when predicting the households' evacuation decisions, the enhanced logistic regression model outperformed previous linear models in terms of both model fit and predictive capability. This outcome suggests that our proposed methodology could provide a new tool and framework for emergency management authorities to improve the prediction of evacuation traffic demands in a timely and accurate manner.

AB Wearable sensing technologies can be used for precision livestock production and to study foraging strategies to better understand the relationships between herbivores, vegetation, and landscape. In this context, monitoring grazing behavior (i.e. chew and bite events) can provide critical information for livestock management. This study presents a computational tool that utilizes wearable sensing and deep learning to distinguish chew and bite events in horses. A micro camera equipped with a microphone (0?18 kHz) was used to obtain video/audio data from horses during grazing. The collected audio data were treated in a pre-processing filtering step, then used to train a recurrent neural network (RNN) with a long short-term memory (LSTM) layer to detect and distinguish chews, bites, and noise events. A post-processing sliding window technique was used to filter events with low confidence levels and lengths. Initial evaluation of this system showed an accuracy of 88.64% for bite identification and an accuracy of 94.13% for chew identification. The distinction between events and evaluation of responses to different pasture species and structure can provide useful information on the plant-animal interface. That is aligned to information such as bite rate, bite mass, and grazing time, and can help determine management strategies that optimize intake and provide data for modeling foraging behavior to predict pasture use and animal performance.

AB We present new constraints on the masses of the halos hosting the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies derived using graph neural networks. Our models, trained on 2,000 state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations of the CAMELS project, only make use of the positions, velocities and stellar masses of the galaxies belonging to the halos, and are able to perform likelihood-free inference on halo masses while accounting for both cosmological and astrophysical uncertainties. Our constraints are in agreement with estimates from other traditional methods, within our derived posterior standard deviation.

AB An accurate representation of hydrodynamic force and torque experienced by every particle in a distribution can be obtained from particle resolved (PR) simulations. These unique quantities are influenced by the deterministic position of surrounding particles. However, systems simulated with this methodology are typically limited to O(10,000)$$ O\left(10,000\right) $$ particles due to the involved computational cost. This resource requirement is a major bottleneck in analyzing the effect of variations in particle distribution. This article attempts to address this bottleneck by availing relatively inexpensive deep learning models. The surrogate models that we employ in this article use a physics-based hierarchical framework and symmetry-preserving neural networks to achieve robustness with limited training data. This article first performs additional generalizability tests on PR data of distinct distributions that are not involved in the training process. The models are then deployed on several different particle distributions. Impact of clustering and structure on the observed statistics are investigated.

AB In order to evaluate the quality of Internet of Things (IoT) environments in smart houses, large datasets containing interactions between people and ubiquitous environments are essential for hardware and software testing. Both testing and simulation require a substantial amount of time and volunteer resources. Consequently, the ability to simulate these ubiquitous environments has recently increased in importance. In order to create an easy-to-use simulator for designing ubiquitous environments, we propose a simulator and autonomous agent generator that simulates human activity in smart houses. The simulator provides a three-dimensional (3D) graphical user interface (GUI) that enables spatial configuration, along with virtual sensors that simulate actual sensors. In addition, the simulator provides an artificial intelligence agent that automatically interacts with virtual smart houses using a motivation-driven behavior planning method. The virtual sensors are designed to detect the states of the smart house and its living agents. The sensed datasets simulate long-term interaction results for ubiquitous computing researchers, reducing the testing costs associated with smart house architecture evaluation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

ID JUDGMENT COMPETENCE
AB Objectives Artificial intelligence tools such as Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) have been used for many health care-related applications; however, there is a lack of research on their capabilities for evaluating morally and/or ethically complex medical decisions. The objective of this study was to assess the moral competence of ChatGPT.Materials and methods This cross-sectional study was performed between May 2023 and July 2023 using scenarios from the Moral Competence Test (MCT). Numerical responses were collected from ChatGPT 3.5 and 4.0 to assess individual and overall stage scores, including C-index and overall moral stage preference. Descriptive analysis and 2-sided Student's t-test were used for all continuous data.Results A total of 100 iterations of the MCT were performed and moral preference was found to be higher in the latter Kohlberg-derived arguments. ChatGPT 4.0 was found to have a higher overall moral stage preference (2.325 versus 1.755) when compared to ChatGPT 3.5. ChatGPT 4.0 was also found to have a statistically higher C-index score in comparison to ChatGPT 3.5 (29.03 +/- 11.10 versus 19.32 +/- 10.95, P =.0000275).Discussion ChatGPT 3.5 and 4.0 trended towards higher moral preference for the latter stages of Kohlberg's theory for both dilemmas with C-indices suggesting medium moral competence. However, both models showed moderate variation in C-index scores indicating inconsistency and further training is recommended.Conclusion ChatGPT demonstrates medium moral competence and can evaluate arguments based on Kohlberg's theory of moral development. These findings suggest that future revisions of ChatGPT and other large language models could assist physicians in the decision-making process when encountering complex ethical scenarios.
   In this cross-sectional study, when provided with health care and non-health care scenarios from the Moral Competence Test, ChatGPT 4.0 outperformed ChatGPT 3.5 in both scenarios in terms of moral competence and overall moral stage preference, suggesting medium moral competence. Both models showed moderate variability despite no changes to the prompts, suggesting inconsistency and the need for in-house training. Future developments of large language models have the potential to assist physicians in the decision-making process when encountering a difficult ethical decision.

AB This study investigates whether social-versus task-oriented interaction of virtual shopping assistants differentially benefits low versus high Internet competency older consumers with respect to social (perceived interactivity, trust), cognitive (perceived information load), functional (self-efficacy, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness), and behavioral intent (website patronage intent) outcomes in an online shopping task. A total of 121 older adults (61-89 years) participated in a laboratory experiment with a 2 (digital assistant interaction style: (social-vs. task-oriented) x 2 (user Internet competency: low vs. high) x 2 (user exchange modality: text vs. voice) between-subjects design. The results revealed that users Internet competency and the digital assistant's conversational style had significant interaction effects on social, functional, and behavioral intent outcomes. Social-oriented digital assistants lead to superior social outcomes (enhanced perceptions of two-way interactivity and trust in the integrity of the site) for older users with high Internet competency, who need less task-related assistance. On the other hand, low-competency older users showed significantly superior cognitive (lower perceived information load) and functional outcomes (greater perceived ease and self-efficacy of using the site) when the digital assistant employed a task-oriented interaction style. Theoretical and agent design implications are discussed.

AB To help agricultural advisors to propose innovative crop management systems, simulation models can be a complementary tool to field experiments and prototyping. Crop management systems can be model led either by using a vector representing dates and quantities used as input parameters in crop models or by developing specific decision models linked with biophysical models. The general design process of crop management systems by simulation follows a four-step loop (GSEC): (i) generation; (ii) simulation: (iii) evaluation; (iv) comparison and choice. The Generation step can follow different approaches: from blind generation before Simulation to optimization procedures using artificial intelligence algorithms during the loop process. Simulation is mainly an engineering problem. Evaluation process means assigning a vector of indicators to the simulated crop management systems. A three-point evaluation can be carried out oil the Simulated crop management systems: global, agronomic and analytical. Comparison and choice of different simulated crop management systems raise the question of "monetary" versus "non-monetary" comparison and how to aggregate different quantities such as drainage, nitrogen fertilisers, labour, etc. Different examples are given to illustrate the GSEC loop oil the basis of research programs conducted in France. Methodological advances and challenges are then discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The safety of human workers has been the main concern in human-robot close collaboration. Along with rapidly developed artificial intelligence techniques, deep learning models using two-dimensional images have become feasible solutions for human motion detection. These models serve as "sensors" in the closed-loop system that involve humans and robots. Most existing methods that detect human motion using images do not consider the uncertainty from the deep learning model itself. The mappings established by deep learning models should not be taken blindly, and thus uncertainty should be a natural part of this type of sensor. In particular, model uncertainty should be explicitly quantified and incorporated into robot motion control to guarantee safety. With this motivation, to rigorously quantify the uncertainty of these "sensors", this letter proposes a probabilistic interpretation method and automatically provides a framework to benefit from a deep model's uncertainty. Experimental data from human-robot collaboration has been collected and used to validate the proposed method. A training strategy is proposed to efficiently train surrogate models that learn to refine the prediction of the main Bayesian models. The proposed framework is also compared with Ego hands benchmark showing a 4.7% increase in mIoU.

AB While machine learning (ML) has shown great promise in medical diagnostics, a major challenge is that ML models do not always perform equally well among ethnic groups. This is alarming for women's health, as there are already existing health disparities that vary by ethnicity. Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal syndrome among women of reproductive age and has clear diagnostic differences among ethnic groups. Here, we investigate the ability of four ML algorithms to diagnose BV. We determine the fairness in the prediction of asymptomatic BV using 16S rRNA sequencing data from Asian, Black, Hispanic, and white women. General purpose ML model performances vary based on ethnicity. When evaluating the metric of false positive or false negative rate, we find that models perform least effectively for Hispanic and Asian women. Models generally have the highest performance for white women and the lowest for Asian women. These findings demonstrate a need for improved methodologies to increase model fairness for predicting BV.

AB The continuous convergence of machine learning algorithms, 5G and beyond (5G+) wireless communications, and artificial intelligence (AI) hardware implementation hastens the birth of federated learning (FL) over 5G+ mobile devices, which pushes AI functions to mobile devices and initiates a new era of on-device AI applications. Despite the remarkable progress made in FL, huge energy consumption is one of the most significant obstacles restricting the development of FL over battery-constrained 5G+ mobile devices. To address this issue, in this article, we investigate how to develop energy- efficient FL over 5G+ mobile devices by making a trade-off between energy consumption for "working " (i.e., local computing) and that for "talking " (i.e., wireless communications) in order to boost the overall energy efficiency. Specifically, we first examine energy consumption models for GPU computation and wireless transmissions. Then, we overview the state of the art of integrating FL procedure with energy-efficient learning techniques (gradient sparsification, weight quantization, pruning, etc.). Finally, we present several potential future research directions for FL over 5G+ mobile devices from the perspective of energy efficiency.

AB Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) encompasses the strategies and methodologies used in constructing AI systems that enable end -users to comprehend and interpret the outputs and predictions made by AI models. The increasing deployment of opaque AI applications in highstakes fields, particularly healthcare, has amplified the need for clarity and explainability. This stems from the potential high -impact consequences of erroneous AI predictions in such critical sectors. The effective integration of AI models in healthcare hinges on the capacity of these models to be both explainable and interpretable. Gaining the trust of healthcare professionals necessitates AI applications to be transparent about their decision -making processes and underlying logic. Our paper conducts a systematic review of the various facets and challenges of XAI within the healthcare realm. It aims to dissect a range of XAI methodologies and their applications in healthcare, categorizing them into six distinct groups: feature -oriented methods, global methods, concept models, surrogate models, local pixel -based methods, and human -centric approaches. Specifically, this study focuses on the significance of XAI in addressing healthcarerelated challenges, underscoring its vital role in safety -critical scenarios. Our objective is to provide an exhaustive exploration of XAI's applications in healthcare, alongside an analysis of relevant experimental outcomes, thereby fostering a holistic understanding of XAI's role and potential in this critical domain.

AB While the design practice in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry continues to be a creative activity, approaching the design problem from a perspective of the decision-making science has remarkable potentials that manifest in the delivery of high-performing sustainable structures. These possible gains can be attributed to the myriad of decision-making tools and technologies that can be implemented to assist design efforts, such as artificial intelligence (AI) that combines computational power and data wisdom. Such combination comes to extreme importance amid the mounting pressure on the AEC industry players to deliver economic, environmentally friendly, and socially considerate structures. Despite the promising potentials, the utilization of AI, particularly reinforced learning (RL), to support multidisciplinary design endeavours in the AEC industry is still in its infancy. Thus, the present research discusses developing and applying a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model, an RL application, to assist the preliminary multidisciplinary design efforts in the AEC industry. The experimental work shows that MDP models can expedite identifying viable design alternatives within the solutions space in multidisciplinary design while maximizing the likelihood of finding the optimal design.

AB An Information Retrieval (IR) system consists of document collection, queries issued by users. and the matching/ranking functions used to rank documents in the predicted order of relevance for a given query. A variety of ranking functions have been used in the literature. But studies show that these functions do not perform consistently well across different contexts. In this paper we propose a two-stage integrated framework for discovering and optimizing ranking functions used in IR. The first stage, discovery process, is accomplished by intelligently leveraging the structural and statistical information available in HTML documents by using Genetic Programming techniques to yield novel ranking functions. in the second stage, the optimization process, document retrieval scores of various well-known ranking functions are combined using Genetic Algorithms. The overall discovery and optimization framework is tested oil the well-known TREC collection of web documents for both the ad-hoc retrieval task and the routing task. Utilizing our framework we observe a significant increase in retrieval performance compared to some of the well-known stand alone ranking functions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID LOCALIZATION
AB COVID-19 pneumonia started in December 2019 and caused large casualties and huge economic losses. In this study, we intended to develop a computer-aided diagnosis system based on artificial intelligence to automatically identify the COVID-19 in chest computed tomography images. We utilized transfer learning to obtain the image-level representation (ILR) based on the backbone deep convolutional neural network. Then, a novel neighboring aware representation (NAR) was proposed to exploit the neighboring relationships between the ILR vectors. To obtain the neighboring information in the feature space of the ILRs, an ILR graph was generated based on the k-nearest neighbors algorithm, in which the ILRs were linked with their k-nearest neighboring ILRs. Afterward, the NARs were computed by the fusion of the ILRs and the graph. On the basis of this representation, a novel end-to-end COVID-19 classification architecture called neighboring aware graph neural network (NAGNN) was proposed. The private and public data sets were used for evaluation in the experiments. Results revealed that our NAGNN outperformed all the 10 state-of-the-art methods in terms of generalization ability. Therefore, the proposed NAGNN is effective in detecting COVID-19, which can be used in clinical diagnosis.

AB Objective Given the importance AI in genomics and its potential impact on human health, the American Medical Informatics Association-Genomics and Translational Biomedical Informatics (GenTBI) Workgroup developed this assessment of factors that can further enable the clinical application of AI in this space.Process A list of relevant factors was developed through GenTBI workgroup discussions in multiple in-person and online meetings, along with review of pertinent publications. This list was then summarized and reviewed to achieve consensus among the group members.Conclusions Substantial informatics research and development are needed to fully realize the clinical potential of such technologies. The development of larger datasets is crucial to emulating the success AI is achieving in other domains. It is important that AI methods do not exacerbate existing socio-economic, racial, and ethnic disparities. Genomic data standards are critical to effectively scale such technologies across institutions. With so much uncertainty, complexity and novelty in genomics and medicine, and with an evolving regulatory environment, the current focus should be on using these technologies in an interface with clinicians that emphasizes the value each brings to clinical decision-making.

AB The purpose of this paper is to describe the design and implementation of an unmanned ground vehicle, called the TailGator at CIMAR (Center for Intelligent Machines and Robotics) of the University of Florida. The TailGator is a gas powered, four-wheeled vehicle that was designed for the AUVS1 Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition and has been tested in the contest for 2 years. The vehicle control model and design of the sensory systems are described. The competition is comprised of two events called the Autonomous Challenge and the Navigation Challenge: For the autonomous challenge, line following, obstacle avoidance, and detection are required. Line following is accomplished with a camera system. Obstacle avoidance and detection are accomplished with a laser scanner. For the navigation challenge, waypoint following and obstacle detection are required. The waypoint navigation is implemented with a global positioning system. The TailGator has provided an educational test bed for not only the contest requirements but also other studies in developing artificial intelligence algorithms such as adaptive control, creative control, automatic calibration, and internet-base control. The significance of this effort is in helping engineering and technology students understand the transition from theory to practice.

AB The COVID-19 virus has swept the world and brought great impact to various fields, gaining wide attention from all walks of life since the end of 2019. At present, although the global epidemic situation is leveling off and vaccine doses have been administered in a large amount, confirmed cases are still emerging around the world. To make up for the missed diagnosis caused by the uncertainty of nucleic acid polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, utilizing lung CT examination as a combined detection method to improve the diagnostic rate becomes a necessity. Our research considered the time-consuming and labor-intensive characteristics of the traditional CT analyzing process, and developed an efficient deep learning framework named CSGBBNet to solve the binary classification task of COVID-19 images based on a COVID-Seg model for image preprocessing and a GBBNet for classification. The five runs with random seed on the test set showed our novel framework can rapidly analyze CT scan images and give out effective results for assisting COVID-19 detection, with the mean accuracy of 98.49 +/- 1.23%, the sensitivity of 99.00 +/- 2.00%, the specificity of 97.95 +/- 2.51%, the precision of 98.10 +/- 2.61%, and the F1 score of 98.51 +/- 1.22%. Moreover, our model CSGBBNet performs better when compared with seven previous state-of-the-art methods. In this research, the aim is to link together biomedical research and artificial intelligence and provide some insights into the field of COVID-19 detection.

AB This core component of the Diabetes RElated to Acute pancreatitis and its Mechanisms (DREAM) study will examine the hypothesis that advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques can reflect underlying pathophysiologic changes and provide imaging biomarkers that predict diabetes mellitus (DM) after acute pancreatitis (AP). A subset of participants in the DREAM study will enroll and undergo serial MRI examinations using a specific research protocol. The aim of the study is to differentiate at-risk individuals from those who remain euglycemic by identifying parenchymal features after AP. Performing longitudinal MRI will enable us to observe and understand the natural history of post-AP DM. We will compare MRI parameters obtained by interrogating tissue properties in euglycemic, prediabetic, and incident diabetes subjects and correlate them with metabolic, genetic, and immunological phenotypes. Differentiating imaging parameters will be combined to develop a quantitative composite risk score. This composite risk score will potentially have the ability to monitor the risk of DM in clinical practice or trials. We will use artificial intelligence, specifically deep learning, algorithms to optimize the predictive ability of MRI. In addition to the research MRI, the DREAM study will also correlate clinical computed tomography and MRI scans with DM development.

ID TOPOLOGICAL RELATIONSHIPS
AB Besides topological relationships and approximate relationships, cardinal directions like north and southwest have turned out to be an important class of qualitative spatial relationships. They are of interdisciplinary interest in fields like cognitive science, robotics, artificial intelligence, and qualitative spatial reasoning. In spatial databases and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) they are frequently used as join and selection criteria in spatial queries. However, the available computational models of cardinal directions suffer a number of problems like the use of too coarse approximations of the two spatial operand objects in terms of single representative points or minimum bounding rectangles, the lacking property of converseness of the cardinal directions computed, and the limited applicability to simple instead of complex regions only. This article proposes and formally defines a novel two-phase model, called the Objects Interaction Matrix (OIM) model, that solves these problems, and determines cardinal directions for even complex regions. The model consists of a tiling phase and an interpretation phase. In the tiling phase, a tiling strategy first determines the zones belonging to the nine cardinal directions of each individual region object and then intersects them. The result leads to a bounded grid called objects interaction grid. For each grid cell the information about the region objects that intersect it is stored in an objects interaction matrix. In the subsequent interpretation phase, a well-defined interpretation method is applied to such a matrix and determines the cardinal direction. Spatial example queries illustrate our new cardinal direction concept that is embedded in a spatial extension of SQL and provides user-defined cardinal direction predicates.

AB Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) represents a highly-prevalent complication of diabetes in which individuals suffer from damage to the blood vessels in the retina. The disease manifests itself through lesion presence, starting with microaneurysms, at the nonproliferative stage before being characterized by neovascularization in the proliferative stage. Retinal specialists strive to detect DR early so that the disease can be treated before substantial, irreversible vision loss occurs. The level of DR severity indicates the extent of treatment necessary - vision loss may be preventable by effective diabetes management in mild (early) stages, rather than subjecting the patient to invasive laser surgery. Using artificial intelligence (AI), highly accurate and efficient systems can be developed to help assist medical professionals in screening and diagnosing DR earlier and without the full resources that are available in specialty clinics. In particular, deep learning facilitates diagnosis earlier and with higher sensitivity and specificity. Such systems make decisions based on minimally handcrafted features and pave the way for personalized therapies. Thus, this survey provides a comprehensive description of the current technology used in each step of DR diagnosis. First, it begins with an introduction to the disease and the current technologies and resources available in this space. It proceeds to discuss the frameworks that different teams have used to detect and classify DR. Ultimately, we conclude that deep learning systems offer revolutionary potential to DR identification and prevention of vision loss. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB The citrus industry is an important constituent of Florida's overall agricultural economy. Proper disease control measures must be undertaken in citrus groves to minimize losses. Technological strategies using machine vision and artificial intelligence are being investigated to achieve intelligent farming, including early detection of diseases in groves, selective fungicide application, etc. This research used the color co-occurrence method (CCM) to determine whether texture based hue, saturation, and intensity (HSI) color features in conjunction with statistical classification algorithms could be used to identify diseased and normal citrus leaves under laboratory conditions. Normal and diseased citrus leaf samples with greasy spot, melanose, and scab were evaluated. The leaf sample discriminant analysis using CCM textural features achieved classification accuracies of over 95% for all classes when using hue and saturation texture features. Data models that relied on intensity features suffered a reduction in classification accuracy when categorizing leaf fronts. due to the darker pigmentation of the leaf fronts. This reduction was not experienced on the leaf backs where the lighter pigmentation clearly revealed the disease discoloration. Although, high accuracies were achieved when using an unreduced dataset consisting of all HSI texture features, the overall best performer was determined to be a reduced data model that relied on hue and saturation features. This model was selected due to reduced computational load and the elimination of intensity features, which are not robust in the presence of ambient light variation. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB The idea that we can detect subacute potentially catastrophic illness earlier by using statistical models trained on clinical data is now well-established. We review evidence that supports the role of continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring in these predictive analytics monitoring tools. In particular, we review how continuous ECG moni-toring reflects the patient and not the clinician, is less likely to be biased, is unaffected by changes in practice patterns, captures signatures of illnesses that are interpretable by clinicians, and is an underappreciated and underutilized source of detailed information for new mathematical methods to reveal.

AB Powered by artificial intelligence (AI), chatbots are increasingly capable of simulating human-like conversations. But, is this desirable for strategic communications? Will chatbots be more persuasive if they are more humanlike, not only in their appearance but also in their interaction and delivery of advertising content? We explored these questions with a 2 (chatbot profile: human-like vs. machine-like) x 2 (message interactivity: high vs. low) x 2 (ad type: narrative vs. factual) experiment (N = 414). Data reveal that high message interactivity fosters positive attitudes toward the chatbot and the ad by mitigating violated expectancy. Narrative ads promote chatbot advertising through perceived transportation. A three-way interaction revealed that when a chatbot is machine-like in appearance, higher interactivity and adoption of a narrative style of delivery serve to increase ad persuasiveness by heightening social presence. Theoretical and practical implications for chatbot advertising are discussed.

AB The rapid development of new technologies and the changing landscape of the online world (e.g., Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of All, cloud-based solutions) provide a unique opportunity for developing automated and robotic systems for urban farming, agriculture, and forestry. Technological advances in machine vision, global positioning systems, laser technologies, actuators, and mechatronics have enabled the development and implementation of robotic systems and intelligent technologies for precision agriculture. Herein, we present and review robotic applications on plant pathology and management, and emerging agricultural technologies for intra-urban agriculture. Greenhouse advanced management systems and technologies have been greatly developed in the last years, integrating IoT and WSN (Wireless Sensor Network). Machine learning, machine vision, and AI (Artificial Intelligence) have been utilized and applied in agriculture for automated and robotic farming. Intelligence technologies, using machine vision/learning, have been developed not only for planting, irrigation, weeding (to some extent), pruning, and harvesting, but also for plant disease detection and identification. However, plant disease detection still represents an intriguing challenge, for both abiotic and biotic stress. Many recognition methods and technologies for identifying plant disease symptoms have been successfully developed; still, the majority of them require a controlled environment for data acquisition to avoid false positives. Machine learning methods (e.g., deep and transfer learning) present promising results for improving image processing and plant symptom identification. Nevertheless, diagnostic specificity is a challenge for microorganism control and should drive the development of mechatronics and robotic solutions for disease management.

AB The Q-learning approach, within deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methodology, is beneficial in multifarious tasks, one of them including enhancement of navigational tasks, shown by the DQN approach; merging Q-learning with deep neural networks is not without its challenges, particularly in situations where there is a chance of overestimating the correct value. In order to address the problems described above in the realm of electric and hybrid vehicles (EHVs), a quantum-computational adaptation that is influenced by Double Q-learning as a potential solution is proposed i.e., QED2Q-N. The enhanced version increases the efficacy of navigation by addressing the overestimates, which were included in previous editions, conceived with the intention of approximately modeling functions on a broad scale. The expansion of electric and hybrid vehicles (EHVs) toward growing autonomy, along with improvements in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), pose significant cybersecurity threats in the disciplines of vehicle automation and cooperative ITS. These underlying dangers may be found in the sectors of vehicle automation and cooperative ITS with an emphasis on the ways in which quantum-enhanced systems may assist in strengthening defenses, the use of quantum computing and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) merged together, works to bring improvement in EHV navigation accuracy and the enhancement of overall system security. The study underlines the relevance of adopting a quantum-computing technique in order to properly solve the dynamic issues associated with EHV technology.

AB Identifying and quantifying the number and size of stomata on leaf surfaces is useful for a wide range of plant ecophysiological studies, specifically those related to water-use efficiency of different plant species or agricultural crops. The time-consuming nature of manually counting and measuring stomata have limited the utility of manual methods for large-scale precision agriculture applications. A deep learning segmentation network was developed to automate the analysis of stomatal density and size and to distinguish between open and closed stomata using citrus trees grafted on different rootstocks as a model system. A novel method was developed utilizing the Mask-RCNN algorithm, which allows identification, quantification, and characterization of stomata from leaf epidermal peel microscopic images with an accuracy of up to 99%. Moreover, this method permits the differentiation of open and closed stomata with 98% precision and measurement of individual stomata size. In the citrus model system, significant differences in the size and density of stomata and diurnal regulation patterns were detected that were associated with the rootstock cultivar on which the trees were grafted. Nearly 9000 individual stomata were analyzed, which would have been impractical using manual methods. The novel automated method presented here is not only accurate, but also rapid and low-cost, and can be applied to a variety of crop and non-crop plant species.

AB Simple Summary Performing a mitosis count (MC) is essential in grading canine Soft Tissue Sarcoma (cSTS) and canine Perivascular Wall Tumours (cPWTs), although it is subject to inter- and intra-observer variability. To enhance standardisation, an artificial intelligence mitosis detection approach was investigated. A two-step annotation process was utilised with a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model, refined through veterinary pathologists' reviews of false positives, and subsequently optimised using an F1-score thresholding method to maximise accuracy measures. The study achieved a best F1-score of 0.75, demonstrating competitiveness in the field of canine mitosis detection.Abstract Performing a mitosis count (MC) is the diagnostic task of histologically grading canine Soft Tissue Sarcoma (cSTS). However, mitosis count is subject to inter- and intra-observer variability. Deep learning models can offer a standardisation in the process of MC used to histologically grade canine Soft Tissue Sarcomas. Subsequently, the focus of this study was mitosis detection in canine Perivascular Wall Tumours (cPWTs). Generating mitosis annotations is a long and arduous process open to inter-observer variability. Therefore, by keeping pathologists in the loop, a two-step annotation process was performed where a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model was trained on initial annotations provided by veterinary pathologists. The pathologists reviewed the output false positive mitosis candidates and determined whether these were overlooked candidates, thus updating the dataset. Faster R-CNN was then trained on this updated dataset. An optimal decision threshold was applied to maximise the F1-score predetermined using the validation set and produced our best F1-score of 0.75, which is competitive with the state of the art in the canine mitosis domain.

AB Poison ivy (Toxicodendron radicans) is an important noxious plants in many countries around the world. Currently, the primary method used to identify this plant is based on visual evaluations of the leaf shape and arrangement. In this study, we evaluated four variations of YOLO-Tiny to identify Poison ivy and we proposed a smartphone application (APP) to perform the detection in real-time. Images were taken in different parks located in the United States and then augmented, totaling 3,407 images and 73,824 annotations. The model with the highest mean average precision (mAP), precision (P), recall (R), F1-score, and lowest loss function value was selected to build the APP. Two smartphones (Motorola M51 and Xiaomi Redmi Note 11 Pro) and five input resolutions were evaluated (224, 288, 320, 384, and 416 width and height pixels). The best performance during the training was achieved using a YOLOv4-Tiny-3 L architecture with mAP of 78.8%, 0.85 (P), 0.60 (R), 0.7 (F1-score), and 3.55 for the loss function. The APP evaluation revealed that at 224 and 288 pixels, F1-scores were lower (around 0.39) and fewer plants were identified but the FPS was relatively high (around 4.87). At 416 pixels, more plants were identified with high F1-scores (around 0.66), but with a low FPS rate (around 1.96). The best balance between performance and accuracy was observed at 340 and 320 pixels for both devices. Overall, the results suggest that YOLOv4-tiny-Tiny-3 L can successfully be deployed in smartphones to identify Poison ivy.

DT Article
DE recidivism; artificial intelligence; criminal justice; racial bias;
   disparate treatment
ID AFFIRMATIVE-ACTION
AB Recent studies have shown that recidivism scoring algorithms like COMPAS have significant racial bias: Black defendants are roughly twice as likely as white defendants to be mis-takenly classified as medium-or high -risk. This has led some to call for abolishing COMPAS. But many others have argued that algorithms should instead be given access to a defendant's race, which, perhaps counterintuitively, is likely to improve outcomes. This approach can involve either estab-lishing race-sensitive risk thresholds, or distinct racial `tracks'. Is there a moral difference between these two approaches? We first consider Deborah Hellman's view that the use of distinct racial tracks (but not distinct thresholds) does not constitute disparate treatment since the effects on individuals are indirect and does not rely on a racial generalization. We argue that this is mistaken: the use of different racial tracks seems both to have direct effects on and to rely on a racial generalization. We then offer an alternative understanding of the distinction between these two approaches-namely, that the use of different cut points is to the counterfactual comparative disadvantage, ex ante, of all white defendants, while the use of different racial tracks can in principle be to the advantage of all groups, though some defendants in both groups will fare worse. Does this mean that the use of cut points is impermissible? Ultimately, we argue, while there are reasons to be skeptical of the use of distinct cut points, it is an open question whether these reasons suffice to make a difference to their moral permissibility.

AB The citrus industry is an important constituent of Florida's overall agricultural economy. Proper disease control measures must be undertaken in citrus groves to minimize losses. Technological strategies using machine vision and artificial intelligence are being investigated to achieve intelligent farming, including early detection of diseases in groves, selective fungicide application, etc. This research used a texture analysis method termed the color co-occurrence method (CCM) to determine whether classification algorithms could be used to identify diseased and normal citrus leaves. Normal and diseased citrus leaf samples with greasy spot, melanose, and scab were collected in the field and brought to the laboratory for the development of suitable segmentation and classification algorithms. Four feature models were created for classification analysis using varying subsets of a 39-variable texture feature set. The classification strategies used were based on a Mahalanobis minimum distance classifier using the nearest neighbor principle, as well as neural network classifiers based on the back-propagation algorithm and radial basis functions. The leaf sample discriminant analysis using the Mahalanobis statistical classifier and the CCM textural analysis achieved classification accuracies of over 95% for all classes (99% mean accuracy) when using hue and saturation texture features. Likewise, a back-propagation neural network algorithm achieved accuracies of over 90%,for all classes (95% mean accuracy) when using hue and saturation features. It was concluded that the Mahalanobis statistical classifier and the back-propagation neural network classifier performed equally well when using ten hue and saturation texture features selected through a stepwise variable reduction method. Future studies will seek to apply the developed algorithms in a natural citrus grove environment.

AB Peptide-based drugs offer high specificity, potency, and selectivity. However, their inherent flexibility and differences in conformational preferences between their free and bound states create unique challenges that have hindered progress in effective drug discovery pipelines. The emergence of AlphaFold (AF) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents new opportunities for enhancing peptide-based drug discovery. We explore recent advancements that facilitate a successful peptide drug discovery pipeline, considering peptides' attractive therapeutic properties and strategies to enhance their stability and bioavailability. AF enables efficient and accurate prediction of peptide-protein structures, addressing a critical requirement in computational drug discovery pipelines. In the post-AF era, we are witnessing rapid progress with the potential to revolutionize peptide-based drug discovery such as the ability to rank peptide binders or classify them as binders/non-binders and the ability to design novel peptide sequences. However, AI-based methods are struggling due to the lack of well-curated datasets, for example to accommodate modified amino acids or unconventional cyclization. Thus, physics-based methods, such as docking or molecular dynamics simulations, continue to hold a complementary role in peptide drug discovery pipelines. Moreover, MD-based tools offer valuable insights into binding mechanisms, as well as the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of complexes. As we navigate this evolving landscape, a synergistic integration of AI and physics-based methods holds the promise of reshaping the landscape of peptide-based drug discovery.This article is categorized under:Structure and Mechanism > Computational Biochemistry and BiophysicsMolecular and Statistical Mechanics > Molecular InteractionsSoftware > Molecular Modeling

AB Education is poised for a transformative shift with the advent of neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (NAI), which will redefine how we support deeply adaptive and personalized learning experiences. The integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with Large Language Models (LLMs), a significant and popular form of NAI, presents a promising avenue for advancing personalized instruction via neurosymbolic educational agents. By leveraging structured knowledge, these agents can provide individualized learning experiences that align with specific learner preferences and desired learning paths, while also mitigating biases inherent in traditional AI systems. NAI-powered education systems will be capable of interpreting complex human concepts and contexts while employing advanced problem-solving strategies, all grounded in established pedagogical frameworks. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages the unique affordances of KGs, LLMs, and pedagogical agents - embodied characters designed to enhance learning - as critical components of a hybrid NAI architecture. We discuss the rationale for our system design and the preliminary findings of our work. We conclude that education in the era of NAI will make learning more accessible, equitable, and aligned with real-world skills. This is an era that will explore a new depth of understanding in educational tools.

AB Climate change and rapid urban development have intensified the impact of hurricanes, especially on the Southeastern Coasts of the United States. Localized and timely risk assessments can facilitate coastal communities' preparedness and response to imminent hurricanes. Existing assessment methods focused on hurricane risks at large spatial scales, which were not specific or could not provide actionable knowledge for residents or property owners. Fragility functions and other widely utilized assessment methods cannot model the complex relationships between building features and hurricane risk levels effectively. Therefore, we develop and test a building-level hurricane risk assessment with deep feedforward neural network (DFNN) models. The input features of DFNN models cover the meta building characteristics, fine-grained meteorological, and hydrological environmental parameters. The assessment outcomes, that is, risk levels, include the probability and intensity of building/property damages induced by wind and surge hazards. We interpret the DFNN models with local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME). We apply the DFNN models to a case building in Cameron County, Louisiana in response to a hypothetical imminent hurricane to illustrate how the building's risk levels can be timely assessed with the updating weather forecast. This research shows the potential of deep-learning models in integrating multi-sourced features and accurately predicting buildings' risks of weather extremes for property owners and households. The AI-powered risk assessment model can help coastal populations form appropriate and updating perceptions of imminent hurricanes and inform actionable knowledge for proactive risk mitigation and long-term climate adaptation.

AB The image-based detection and classification of plant diseases has become increasingly important to the development of precision agriculture. We consider the case of tomato, a high-value crop supporting the livelihoods of many farmers around the world. Many biotic and abiotic plant health issues impede the efficient production of this crop, and laboratory-based diagnostics are inaccessible in many remote regions. Early detection of these plant health issues is essential for efficient and accurate response, prompting exploration of alternatives for field detection. Considering the availability of low-cost smartphones, artificial intelligence-based classification facilitated by mobile phone imagery can be a practical option. This study introduces a smartphone-attachable 30x microscopic lens, used to produce the novel tomato microimaging data set of 8,500 images representing 34 tomato plant conditions on the upper and lower sides of leaves as well as on the surface of tomato fruits. We introduce TOMMicroNet, a 14-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to classify biotic and abiotic plant health issues, and we compare it against six existing pretrained CNN models. We compared two separate pipelines of grouping data for training TOMMicroNet, either presenting all data at once or separating the data into subsets based on the three parts of the plant. Comparing configurations based on cross-validation and F1 scores, we determined that TOMMicroNet attained the highest performance when trained on the complete data set, with 95% classification accuracy on both training and external data sets. Given TOMMicroNet's capabilities when presented with unfamiliar data, this approach has potential for the identification of plant health issues.

AB DBS Think Tank IX was held on August 25-27, 2021 in Orlando FL with US based participants largely in person and overseas participants joining by video conferencing technology. The DBS Think Tank was founded in 2012 and provides an open platform where clinicians, engineers and researchers (from industry and academia) can freely discuss current and emerging deep brain stimulation (DBS) technologies as well as the logistical and ethical issues facing the field. The consensus among the DBS Think Tank IX speakers was that DBS expanded in its scope and has been applied to multiple brain disorders in an effort to modulate neural circuitry. After collectively sharing our experiences, it was estimated that globally more than 230,000 DBS devices have been implanted for neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. As such, this year's meeting was focused on advances in the following areas: neuromodulation in Europe, Asia and Australia; cutting-edge technologies, neuroethics, interventional psychiatry, adaptive DBS, neuromodulation for pain, network neuromodulation for epilepsy and neuromodulation for traumatic brain injury.

AB In recent years, continuous growing interests have been seen in bringing artificial intelligence capabilities to mobile devices. However, the related work still faces several issues, such as constrained computation and memory resources, power drain, and thermal limitation. To develop deep learning (DL) algorithms on mobile devices, we need to understand their behaviors. In this article, we explore the architectural behaviors of some mainstream DL frameworks on mobile devices by performing a comprehensive characterization of performance, accuracy, energy efficiency, and thermal behaviors. We experimentally choose four model compression methods to perform on networks and in addition, analyze the related impact on the nodes amount, memory, execution time, model size, inference time, energy consumption, and thermal distribution. With insights into DL-based mobile application characteristics, we hope to guide the design of future smartphone platforms for lower energy consumption.

AB Priority-dispatching rules have been studied for many decades, and they form the backbone of much industrial scheduling practice. Developing new dispatching rules for a given environment, however, is usually a tedious process involving implementing different rules in a simulation model of the facility under study and evaluating the rule through extensive simulation experiments. In this research, an innovative approach is presented, which is capable of automatically discovering effective dispatching rules. This is a significant step beyond current applications of artificial intelligence to production scheduling, which are mainly based on learning to select a given rule from among a number of candidates rather than identifying new and potentially more effective rules. The proposed approach is evaluated in a variety of single machine environments, and discovers rules that are competitive with those in the literature, which are the results of decades of research.

AB T cell receptors (TCR) play a vital role in the immune system's ability to recognize and respond to foreign antigens, relying on the highly polymorphic rearrangement of TCR genes. The recognition of autologous peptides by adaptive immunity may lead to the development and progression of autoimmune diseases. Understanding the specific TCR involved in this process can provide insights into the autoimmune process. RNA-seq (RNA sequencing) is a valuable tool for studying TCR repertoires by providing a comprehensive and quantitative analysis of the RNA transcripts. With the development of RNA technology, transcriptomic data must provide valuable information to model and predict TCR and antigen interaction and, more importantly, identify or predict neoantigens. This review provides an overview of the application and development of bulk RNA-seq and single-cell (SC) RNA-seq to examine the TCR repertoires. Furthermore, discussed here are bioinformatic tools that can be applied to study the structural biology of peptide/TCR/MHC (major histocompatibility complex) and predict antigenic epitopes using advanced artificial intelligence tools.

AB Substantial efforts have been made for local administration of small molecules or biologics in treating hearing loss diseases caused by either trauma, genetic mutations, or drug ototoxicity. Recently, extracellular vesicles (EVs) naturally secreted from cells have drawn increasing attention on attenuating hearing impairment from both preclinical studies and clinical studies. Highly emerging field utilizing diverse bioengineering technologies for developing EVs as the bioderived therapeutic materials, along with artificial intelligence (AI) -based targeting toolkits, shed the light on the unique properties of EVs specific to inner ear delivery. This review will illuminate such exciting research field from fundamentals of hearing protective functions of EVs to biotechnology advancement and potential clinical translation of functionalized EVs. Specifically, the advancements in assessing targeting ligands using AI algorithms are systematically discussed. The overall translational potential of EVs is reviewed in the context of auditory sensing system for developing next generation gene therapy.

TI A translational perspective towards clinical AI fairness

ID ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; BIAS; ALGORITHM; HEALTH
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated the ability to extract insights from data, but the fairness of such data-driven insights remains a concern in high-stakes fields. Despite extensive developments, issues of AI fairness in clinical contexts have not been adequately addressed. A fair model is normally expected to perform equally across subgroups defined by sensitive variables (e.g., age, gender/sex, race/ethnicity, socio-economic status, etc.). Various fairness measurements have been developed to detect differences between subgroups as evidence of bias, and bias mitigation methods are designed to reduce the differences detected. This perspective of fairness, however, is misaligned with some key considerations in clinical contexts. The set of sensitive variables used in healthcare applications must be carefully examined for relevance and justified by clear clinical motivations. In addition, clinical AI fairness should closely investigate the ethical implications of fairness measurements (e.g., potential conflicts between group- and individual-level fairness) to select suitable and objective metrics. Generally defining AI fairness as "equality" is not necessarily reasonable in clinical settings, as differences may have clinical justifications and do not indicate biases. Instead, "equity" would be an appropriate objective of clinical AI fairness. Moreover, clinical feedback is essential to developing fair and well-performing AI models, and efforts should be made to actively involve clinicians in the process. The adaptation of AI fairness towards healthcare is not self-evident due to misalignments between technical developments and clinical considerations. Multidisciplinary collaboration between AI researchers, clinicians, and ethicists is necessary to bridge the gap and translate AI fairness into real-life benefits.

ID QUERY
AB Topological relationships like overlap, inside, meet, and disjoint uniquely characterize the relative position between objects in space. For a long time, they have been a focus of interdisciplinary research as in artificial intelligence, cognitive science, linguistics, robotics, and spatial reasoning. Especially as predicates, they support the design of suitable query languages for spatial data retrieval and analysis in spatial database systems and geographical information systems. While, to a large extent, conceptual aspects of topological predicates (like their definition and reasoning with them) as well as strategies for avoiding unnecessary or repetitive predicate executions (like predicate migration and spatial index structures) have been emphasized, the development of robust and efficient implementation techniques for them has been largely neglected. Especially the recent design of topological predicates for all combinations of complex spatial data types has resulted in a large increase of their numbers and stressed the importance of their efficient implementation. The goal of this article is to develop correct and efficient implementation techniques of topological predicates for all combinations of complex spatial data types including two-dimensional point, line, and region objects, as they have been specified by different authors and in different commercial and public domain software packages. Our solution consists of two phases. In the exploration phase, for a given scene of two spatial objects, all topological events like intersection and meeting situations are summarized in two precisely defined topological feature vectors (one for each argument object of a topological predicate) whose specifications are characteristic and unique for each combination of spatial data types. These vectors serve as input for the evaluation phase which analyzes the topological events and determines the Boolean result of a topological predicate (predicate verification) or the kind of topological predicate (predicate determination) by a formally defined method called nine-intersection matrix characterization. Besides this general evaluation method, the article presents an optimized method for predicate verification, called matrix thinning, and an optimized method for predicate determination, called minimum cost decision tree. The methods presented in this article are applicable to all known complete collections of mutually exclusive topological predicates that are formally based on the well known nine-intersection model.

AB Individuals who have suffered neurotrauma like a stroke or brachial plexus injury often experience reduced limb functionality. Soft robotic exoskeletons have been successful in assisting rehabilitative treatment and improving activities of daily life but restoring dexterity for tasks such as playing musical instruments has proven challenging. This research presents a soft robotic hand exoskeleton coupled with machine learning algorithms to aid in relearning how to play the piano by `feeling' the difference between correct and incorrect versions of the same song. The exoskeleton features piezoresistive sensor arrays with 16 taxels integrated into each fingertip. The hand exoskeleton was created as a single unit, with polyvinyl acid (PVA) used as a stent and later dissolved to construct the internal pressure chambers for the five individually actuated digits. Ten variations of a song were produced, one that was correct and nine containing rhythmic errors. To classify these song variations, Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithms were trained with data from the 80 taxels combined from the tactile sensors in the fingertips. Feeling the differences between correct and incorrect versions of the song was done with the exoskeleton independently and while the exoskeleton was worn by a person. Results demonstrated that the ANN algorithm had the highest classification accuracy of 97.13% +/- 2.00% with the human subject and 94.60% +/- 1.26% without. These findings highlight the potential of the smart exoskeleton to aid disabled individuals in relearning dexterous tasks like playing musical instruments.

AB This article provides an in-depth look at how K-12 students should be introduced to Machine Learning and the knowledge and skills they will develop as a result. We begin with an overview of the AI4K12 Initiative, which is developing national guidelines for teaching AI in K-12, and briefly discuss each of the "Five Big Ideas in AI" that serve as the organizing framework for the guidelines. We then discuss the general format and structure of the guidelines and grade band progression charts and provide a theoretical framework that highlights the developmental appropriateness of the knowledge and skills we want to impart to students and the learning experiences we expect them to engage in. Development of the guidelines is informed by best practices from Learning Sciences and CS Education research, and by the need for alignment with CSTA's K-12 Computer Science Standards, Common Core standards, and Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). The remainder of the article provides an in-depth exploration of the AI4K12 Big Idea 3 (Learning) grade band progression chart to unpack the concepts we expect students to master at each grade band. We present examples to illustrate the progressions from two perspectives: horizontal (across grade bands) and vertical (across concepts for a given grade band). Finally, we discuss how these guidelines can be used to create learning experiences that make connections across the Five Big Ideas, and free online tools that facilitate these experiences.

AB Measurement of plant characteristics is still the primary bottleneck in both plant breeding and crop management. Rapid and accurate acquisition of information about large plant populations is critical for monitoring plant health and dissecting the underlying genetic traits. In recent years, high-throughput phenotyping technology has benefitted immensely from both remote sensing and machine learning. Simultaneous use of multiple sensors (e.g., high-resolution RGB, multispectral, hyperspectral, chlorophyll fluorescence, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR)) allows a range of spatial and spectral resolutions depending on the trait in question. Meanwhile, computer vision and machine learning methodology have emerged as powerful tools for extracting useful biological information from image data. Together, these tools allow the evaluation of various morphological, structural, biophysical, and biochemical traits. In this review, we focus on the recent development of phenomics approaches in strawberry farming, particularly those utilizing remote sensing and machine learning, with an eye toward future prospects for strawberries in precision agriculture. The research discussed is broadly categorized according to strawberry traits related to (1) fruit/flower detection, fruit maturity, fruit quality, internal fruit attributes, fruit shape, and yield prediction; (2) leaf and canopy attributes; (3) water stress; and (4) pest and disease detection. Finally, we present a synthesis of the potential research opportunities and directions that could further promote the use of remote sensing and machine learning in strawberry farming.

AB As an empirical effort to explore the public relations potential of AI-enabled technologies such as chatbots, this study examined how chatbot social conversation-a communication strategy that encompasses both social presence and conversational human voice and is conceptualized in consideration of chatbots' mediated communication environment-can contribute to organization-public relational outcomes (i.e., OPRs). To understand how this process works, we incorporate the personification approach to organizations, and also investigate the impact of chatbot social conversation in shaping public perceptions of corporate character (i.e., agreeableness, enterprise, competence, and ruthlessness). A survey of 778 Facebook users in the United States was conducted, where participants were randomly assigned to have a guided conversation with an AI-enabled social chatbot utilized by real companies on Facebook. Results confirm that chatbot social conversation can serve as a strong antecedent of the corporate character of the organization that deployed it and OPRs. Perceived corporate character also directly influences the quality of OPRs, demonstrating the potential of using AI-enabled social chatbots for public relations purposes.

AB In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) advancements have greatly influenced the agricultural industry, particularly with the emergence of large foundation models. One such model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) developed by Meta AI Research, has revolutionized object segmentation tasks. While SAM has demonstrated success in various agricultural applications, its potential in the poultry industry, specifically regarding cage-free hens, remains largely unexplored. This study aims to evaluate SAM's zero-shot segmentation performance for chicken segmentation tasks, including part-based segmentation and the utilization of infrared thermal images. Additionally, it investigates SAM's ability to predict weight and track chickens. The results highlight SAM's superior performance compared to SegFormer and SETR for both whole and part-based chicken segmentation. SAM demonstrated remarkable performance improvements, achieving a mean intersection of union (mIoU) of 94.8% when using the total points prompts. Furthermore, SAM-based chicken segmentation provides valuable insights into weight prediction, as well as behavior and movement patterns of broiler birds. These findings contribute to the understanding of SAM's potential in poultry science, paving the way for future advancements in chicken segmentation and tracking using large foundation model.

AB The detection of neutrons above background levels is an indication of nuclear materials, creating significant applications for handheld neutron detectors in homeland security. For such applications, a B-10 and Li-6 enriched, scintillating glass neutron detector was designed. The model is compact enough to be used as a handheld detector and is equipped with machine learning capabilities to determine the location of the source and discriminate a neutron from a gamma. Lithium Borosilicate glass samples, with up to 70% B-10 and Li-6 content, and doped with Tb and Eu, were engineered to optimize the performance of the detector. The scintillation properties and neutron/gamma detection capabilities of the glass samples were tested. The model detector's performance was simulated in Geant4 and the simulation data was utilized for machine learning to predict the location of the source with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The reported handheld neutron detector design with the implemented artificial intelligence capability can achieve 99.9% accuracy in neutron/gamma discrimination, 8.9% error in radial angle estimates, and 2.9% error in azimuthal angle estimates.

AB Plant diseases pose significant economic challenges and may lead to ecological consequences. Although plant pathologists have a significant ability to diagnose plant diseases, rapid, accurate, and early diagnosis of plant diseases by intelligent systems could improve disease control and management. This study evaluates six efficient classification models (classifiers) based on deep learning to detect common tomato diseases by analyzing symptomatic patterns on leaves. Additionally, group learning techniques, including simple and weighted majority voting methods, were employed to enhance classification performance further. Six tomato leaf diseases, including Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae bacterial spot, Phytophthora infestance late blight, Cladosporium fulvum leaf mold, Septoria lycopersici Septoria leaf spot, Corynespora cassiicola target spot, and Alternaria solani early blight, as well as healthy leaves, resulting in a total of seven classes, were utilized for the classification. Deep learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), GoogleNet, ResNet-50, AlexNet, Inception v3, and MobileNet, were utilized, achieving classification accuracies of 65.8%, 84.9%, 93.4%, 89.4%, 93.4%, and 96%, respectively. Furthermore, applying the group learning approaches significantly improved the results, with simple majority voting achieving a classification accuracy of 99.5% and weighted majority voting achieving 100%. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the proposed deep ensemble learning models in accurately identifying and classifying tomato diseases, featuring their potential for practical applications in tomato disease diagnosis and management.

AB The Entomological Society of America (ESA) Student Debates is an annual student competition at the ESA Annual Meeting organized by Student Debates Subcommittee (SDS) members of the ESA Student Affairs Committee. In conjunction with the 2023 ESA Annual Meeting theme, 'Insects and influence: Advancing entomology's impact on people and policy', the theme of this year's student debate was 'Addressing emerging issues in entomology'. With the aid of ESA membership, the SDS selected the following debate topics: (1) Should disclosure of artificial intelligence large language models in scientific writing always be required? and (2) Is it more important to prioritize honey bee or native pollinator health for long-term food security within North America? Four student teams from across the nation, composed of 3-5 student members and a professional advisor, were assigned a topic and stance. Over the course of 5 months, all team members researched and prepared for their assigned topic before debating live with an opposing team at the 2023 ESA Annual Meeting in National Harbor, Maryland. SDS members additionally prepared and presented introductions for each debate topic to provide unbiased backgrounds to the judges and audience for context in assessing teams' arguments. The result was an engaging discussion between our teams, judges, and audience members on emerging issues facing entomology and its impact on people and policy, such as scientific communication and food security, that brought attention to the complexities involved when debating topics concerning insects and influence.

ID QUERY
AB For a long time topological relationships between spatial objects have been a focus of research in a number of disciplines like artificial intelligence, cognitive science, linguistics, robotics, and spatial reasoning. Especially as predicates they support the design of suitable query languages for spatial data retrieval and analysis in spatial databases and geographical information systems (GIS). Unfortunately, they have so far only been defined for and applicable to simplified abstractions of spatial objects like single points, continuous lines, and simple regions. With the introduction of complex spatial data types an issue arises regarding the design, definition, and number of topological relationships operating on these complex types. This article closes this gap and first introduces definitions of general and versatile spatial data types for complex points, complex lines, and complex regions. Based on the well known 9-intersection model, it then determines the complete sets of mutually exclusive topological relationships for all type combinations. Completeness and mutual exclusion are shown by a proof technique called proof-by-constraint-and-drawing. Due to the resulting large numbers of predicates and the difficulty of handling them, the user is provided with the concepts of topological cluster predicates and topological predicate groups, which permit one to reduce the number of predicates to be dealt with in a user-defined and/or application-specific manner.

AB Physiatry is a medical specialty focused on improving functional outcomes in patients with a variety of medical conditions that affect the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves, muscles, bones, joints, ligaments, and tendons. Social determinants of health (SDH) play a key role in determining therapeutic process and patient functional outcomes. Big data and precision medicine have been used in other fields and to some extent in physiatry to predict patient outcomes, however many challenges remain. The interplay between SDH and physiatry outcomes is highly variable depending on different phases of care, and more favorable patient profiles in acute care may be less favorable in the outpatient setting. Furthermore, SDH influence which treatments or interventional procedures are accessible to the patient and thus determine outcomes. This opinion paper describes utility of existing datasets in combination with novel data such as movement, gait patterning and patient perceived outcomes could be analyzed with artificial intelligence methods to determine the best treatment plan for individual patients in order to achieve maximal functional capacity.

AB BackgroundAcute kidney injury (AKI) is a multifaceted disease characterized by diverse clinical presentations and mechanisms. Advances in artificial intelligence have propelled the identification of AKI subphenotypes, enhancing our capacity to customize treatments and predict disease trajectories.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review of the literature from 2017 to 2022, focusing on studies that utilized machine learning techniques to identify AKI subphenotypes in adult patients. Data were extracted regarding patient demographics, clustering methodologies, discriminators, and validation efforts from selected studies.ResultsThe review highlights significant variability in subphenotype identification across different populations. All studies utilized clinical data such as comorbidities and laboratory variables to group patients. Two studies incorporated biomarkers of endothelial activation and inflammation into the clinical data to identify subphenotypes. The primary discriminators were comorbidities and laboratory trajectories. The association of AKI subphenotypes with mortality, renal recovery and treatment response was heterogeneous across studies. The use of diverse clustering techniques contributed to variability, complicating the application of findings across different patient populations.ConclusionsIdentifying AKI subphenotypes enables clinicians to better understand and manage individual patient trajectories. Future research should focus on validating these phenotypes in larger, more diverse cohorts to enhance their clinical applicability and support personalized medicine in AKI management.

AB Medical education faces the dual challenge of addressing cognitive overload and sustaining student engagement, particularly in complex subjects such as pharmacology. This study introduces Cinematic Clinical Narratives (CCNs) as an innovative approach to teaching antiparasitic pharmacology, combining generative artificial intelligence (genAI), edutainment, and mnemonic-based learning. The intervention involved two short films, Alien: Parasites Within and Wormquest, designed to teach antiparasitic pharmacology to first-year medical students. A control group of students only received traditional text-based clinical cases, while the experimental group engaged with the CCNs in an active learning environment. Students who received the CCN material scored an average of 8% higher on exam questions related to the material covered by the CCN compared to students in the control group. Results also showed that the CCNs improved engagement and interest among students, as evidenced by significantly higher scores on the Situational Interest Survey for Multimedia (SIS-M) compared to traditional methods. Notably, students preferred CCNs for their storytelling, visuals, and interactive elements. This study underscores the potential of CCNs as a supplementary educational tool, and suggests the potential for broader applications across other medical disciplines outside of antiparasitic pharmacology. By leveraging genAI and edutainment, CCNs represent a scalable and innovative approach to enhancing the medical learning experience.

AB In the current research, gene expression programming (GEP) was applied to model reference evapotranspiration (ETo) in 18 regions of Iran with limited meteorological data. Initially, a genetic algorithm (GA) was employed to detect the most important variables for estimating ETo among mean temperature (Tmean), maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum temperature (Tmin), relative humidity (RH), sunshine (n), and wind speed (WS). The results indicated that a coupled model containing the Tmean and WS can predict ETo accurately (RMSE = 0.3263 mm day(-1)) for arid, semiarid, and Mediterranean climates. Therefore, this model was adjusted using the GEP for all 18 synoptic stations. Under very humid climates, it is recommended to use a temperature-based GEP model versus wind speed-based GEP model. The optimal and lowest performance of the GEP belonged to Shahrekord (SK), RMSE = 0.0650 mm day(-1), and Kerman (KE), RMSE = 0.4177 mm day(-1), respectively. This research shows that the GEP is a robust tool to model ETo in semiarid and Mediterranean climates (R-2 > 0.80). However, GEP is recommended to be used cautiously under very humid climates and some of arid regions (R-2 < 0.50) due to its poor performance under such extreme conditions.

AB Prostate cancer is the most common noncutaneous cancer and the second leading cause of cancer deaths among American men. Statins and omega-3 are two medications recently found to correlate with prostate cancer risk and aggressiveness, but the observed associations are complex and controversial. We therefore explore the novel application of radiomics in studying statin and omega-3 usage in prostate cancer patients. On MRIs of 91 prostate cancer patients, two regions of interest (ROIs), the whole prostate and the peripheral region of the prostate, were manually segmented. From each ROI, 944 radiomic features were extracted after field bias correction and normalization. Heatmaps were generated to study the radiomic feature patterns against statin or omega-3 usage. Radiomics models were trained on selected features and evaluated with 500-round threefold cross-validation for each drug/ROI combination. On the 1500 validation datasets, the radiomics model achieved average AUCs of 0.70, 0.74, 0.78, and 0.72 for omega-3/prostate, omega-3/peripheral, statin/prostate, and statin/peripheral, respectively. As the first study to analyze radiomics in relation to statin and omega-3 uses in prostate cancer patients, our study preliminarily established the existence of imaging-identifiable tissue-level changes in the prostate and illustrated the potential usefulness of radiomics for further exploring these medications' effects and mechanisms in prostate cancer.

AB Background and Objectives: Thyroid nodules are lumps of solid or liquid-filled tumors that form inside the thyroid gland, which can be malignant or benign. Our aim was to test whether the described features of the Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS) could improve radiologists' decision making when integrated into a computer system. In this study, we developed a computer-aided diagnosis system integrated into multiple-instance learning (MIL) that would focus on benign-malignant classification. Data were available from the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. Materials and Methods: There were 99 cases (33 Benign and 66 malignant). In this study, the median filter and image binarization were used for image pre-processing and segmentation. The grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) was used to extract seven ultrasound image features. These data were divided into 87% training and 13% validation sets. We compared the support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) classification algorithms based on their accuracy score, sensitivity, and specificity. The outcome measure was whether the thyroid nodule was benign or malignant. We also developed a graphic user interface (GUI) to display the image features that would help radiologists with decision making. Results: ANN and SVM achieved an accuracy of 75% and 96% respectively. SVM outperformed all the other models on all performance metrics, achieving higher accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity score. Conclusions: Our study suggests promising results from MIL in thyroid cancer detection. Further testing with external data is required before our classification model can be employed in practice.

TI Insulin dose optimization using an automated artificial
   intelligence-based decision support system in youths with type 1
   diabetes
SO NATURE MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Despite the increasing adoption of insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring devices, most people with type 1 diabetes do not achieve their glycemic goals(1). This could be related to a lack of expertise or inadequate time for clinicians to analyze complex sensor-augmented pump data. We tested whether frequent insulin dose adjustments guided by an automated artificial intelligence-based decision support system (AI-DSS) is as effective and safe as those guided by physicians in controlling glucose levels. ADVICE4U was a six-month, multicenter, multinational, parallel, randomized controlled, non-inferiority trial in 108 participants with type 1 diabetes, aged 10-21 years and using insulin pump therapy (ClinicalTrials.gov no. NCT03003806). Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive remote insulin dose adjustment every three weeks guided by either an AI-DSS, (AI-DSS arm, n=54) or by physicians (physician arm, n=54). The results for the primary efficacy measure-the percentage of time spent within the target glucose range (70-180mgdl(-1) (3.9-10.0mmoll(-1)))-in the AI-DSS arm were statistically non-inferior to those in the physician arm (50.211.1% versus 51.6 +/- 11.3%, respectively, P<1x10(-7)). The percentage of readings below 54mgdl(-1) (<3.0mmoll(-1)) within the AI-DSS arm was statistically non-inferior to that in the physician arm (1.3 +/- 1.4% versus 1.0 +/- 0.9%, respectively, P<0.0001). Three severe adverse events related to diabetes (two severe hypoglycemia, one diabetic ketoacidosis) were reported in the physician arm and none in the AI-DSS arm. In conclusion, use of an automated decision support tool for optimizing insulin pump settings was non-inferior to intensive insulin titration provided by physicians from specialized academic diabetes centers.The randomized-controlled trial ADVICE4U demonstrates non-inferiority of an automated AI-based decision support system compared with advice from expert physicians for optimal insulin dosing in youths with type 1 diabetes.

ID REGULARIZATION PATHS; SURVIVAL; MODELS
AB In this manuscript, we analyze a data set containing information on children with Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) enrolled on a clinical trial. Treatments received and survival status were collected together with other covariates such as demographics and clinical measurements. Our main task is to explore the potential of machine learning (ML) algorithms in a survival analysis context in order to improve over the Cox Proportional Hazard (CoxPH) model. We discuss the weaknesses of the CoxPH model we would like to improve upon and then we introduce multiple algorithms, from well-established ones to state-of-the-art models, that solve these issues. We then compare every model according to the concordance index and the Brier score. Finally, we produce a series of recommendations, based on our experience, for practitioners that would like to benefit from the recent advances in artificial intelligence.

AB Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technology design and development continues to be rapid, despite major limitations in its current form as a practice and discipline to address all sociohumanitarian issues and complexities. From these limitations emerges an imperative to strengthen AI and ML literacy in underserved communities and build a more diverse AI and ML design and development workforce engaged in health research.
   Objective: AI and ML has the potentialto account for and assess a variety of factors that contribute to health and disease and to improve prevention, diagnosis, and therapy. Here, we describe recent activities within the Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Consortium to Advance Health Equity and Researcher Diversity (AIM-AHEAD) Ethics and Equity Workgroup (EEWG) that led to the development of deliverables that will help put ethics and fairness at the forefront of AI and ML applications to build equity in biomedical research, education, and health care.
   Methods: The AIM-AHEAD EEWG was created in 2021 with 3 cochairs and 51 members in year 1 and 2 cochairs and similar to 40 members in year 2. Members in both years included AIM-AHEAD principal investigators, coinvestigators, leadership fellows, and research fellows. The EEWG used a modified Delphi approach using polling, ranking, and other exercises to facilitate discussions around tangible steps, key terms, and definitions needed to ensure that ethics and fairness are at the forefront of AI and ML applications to build equity in biomedical research, education, and health care.
   Results: The EEWG developed a set of ethics and equity principles, a glossary, and an interview guide. The ethics and equity principles comprise 5 core principles, each with subparts, which articulate best practices for working with stakeholders from historically and presently underrepresented communities. The glossary contains 12 terms and definitions, with particular emphasis on optimal development, refinement, and implementation of AI and ML in health equity research. To accompany the glossary, the EEWG developed a concept relationship diagram that describes the logical flow of and relationship between the definitional concepts. Lastly, the interview guide provides questions that can be used or adapted to garner stakeholder and community perspectives on the principles and glossary.
   Conclusions: Ongoing engagement is needed around our principles and glossary to identify and predict potential limitations in their uses in AI and ML research settings, especially for institutions with limited resources. This requires time, careful consideration, and honest discussions around what classifies an engagement incentive as meaningful to support and sustain their full engagement. By slowing down to meet historically and presently underresourced institutions and communities wherethey areand wherethey are capable of engaging and competing, there is higher potential to achieve needed diversity, ethics, and equity in AI and ML implementation in health research.

AB Currently, many critical care indices are not captured automatically at a granular level, rather are repetitively assessed by overburdened nurses. In this pilot study, we examined the feasibility of using pervasive sensing technology and artificial intelligence for autonomous and granular monitoring in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). As an exemplary prevalent condition, we characterized delirious patients and their environment. We used wearable sensors, light and sound sensors, and a camera to collect data on patients and their environment. We analyzed collected data to detect and recognize patient's face, their postures, facial action units and expressions, head pose variation, extremity movements, sound pressure levels, light intensity level, and visitation frequency. We found that facial expressions, functional status entailing extremity movement and postures, and environmental factors including the visitation frequency, light and sound pressure levels at night were significantly different between the delirious and non-delirious patients. Our results showed that granular and autonomous monitoring of critically ill patients and their environment is feasible using a noninvasive system, and we demonstrated its potential for characterizing critical care patients and environmental factors.

AB Facial expressions are essential for communication and emotional expression across species. Despite the improvements brought by tools like the Horse Grimace Scale (HGS) in pain recognition in horses, their reliance on human identification of characteristic traits presents drawbacks such as subjectivity, training requirements, costs, and potential bias. Despite these challenges, the development of facial expression pain scales for animals has been making strides. To address these limitations, Automated Pain Recognition (APR) powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a promising advancement. Notably, computer vision and machine learning have revolutionized our approach to identifying and addressing pain in non-verbal patients, including animals, with profound implications for both veterinary medicine and animal welfare. By leveraging the capabilities of AI algorithms, we can construct sophisticated models capable of analyzing diverse data inputs, encompassing not only facial expressions but also body language, vocalizations, and physiological signals, to provide precise and objective evaluations of an animal's pain levels. While the advancement of APR holds great promise for improving animal welfare by enabling better pain management, it also brings forth the need to overcome data limitations, ensure ethical practices, and develop robust ground truth measures. This narrative review aimed to provide a comprehensive overview, tracing the journey from the initial application of facial expression recognition for the development of pain scales in animals to the recent application, evolution, and limitations of APR, thereby contributing to understanding this rapidly evolving field.

AB Human intention prediction plays a critical role in human-robot collaboration, as it helps robots improve efficiency and safety by accurately anticipating human intentions and proactively assisting with tasks. While current applications often focus on predicting intent once human action is completed, recognizing human intent in advance has received less attention. This study aims to equip robots with the capability to forecast human intent before completing an action, i.e., early intent prediction. To achieve this objective, we first extract features from human motion trajectories by analyzing changes in human joint distances. These features are then utilized in a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to determine the state transition times from uncertain intent to certain intent. Second, we propose two models including a Transformer and a Bi-LSTM for classifying motion intentions. Then, we design a human-robot collaboration experiment in which the operator reaches multiple targets while the robot moves continuously following a predetermined path. The data collected through the experiment were divided into two groups: full-length data and partial data before state transitions detected by the HMM. Finally, the effectiveness of the suggested framework for predicting intentions is assessed using two different datasets, particularly in a scenario when motion trajectories are similar but underlying intentions vary. The results indicate that using partial data prior to the motion completion yields better accuracy compared to using full-length data. Specifically, the transformer model exhibits a 2% improvement in accuracy, while the Bi-LSTM model demonstrates a 6% increase in accuracy.

AB Technological and methodological advances in remote sensing and machine learning have created new opportunities for advancing wildlife surveys. We assembled a Community of Practice (CoP) to capitalize on these developments to explore improvements to the efficiency and effectiveness of aerial wildlife monitoring from a management perspective. The core objective of the CoP is to organize the development and testing of remote sensing and machine learning methods to improve aerial wildlife population surveys that support management decisions. Beginning in 2020, the CoP collaboratively identified the natural resource management decisions that are informed by wildlife survey data with a focus on waterbirds and marine wildlife. We surveyed our membership to establish 1) what management decisions they were using wildlife count data to inform; 2) how these count data were collected prior to the advent of remote sensing/machine learning methods; 3) the impetus for transitioning to a remote sensing/machine learning methodological framework; and 4) the challenges practitioners face in transitioning to this framework. This paper documents these findings and identifies research priorities for moving toward operational remote sensing-based wildlife surveys in service of wildlife management.

AB In this paper a new method to improve the utilization of main memory systems is presented. The new method is based on prestoring in main memory a number of query answers, each evaluated out of a single memory page. To this end, the ideas of page-answers and page-traces are formally described and their properties analyzed. The query model used here allows for selection, projection, join, recursive queries as well as arbitrary combinations. We also show how to apply the approach under update traffic. This concept is especially useful in managing the main memories of an important class of applications. This class includes the evaluation of triggers and alerters, performance improvement of rule-based systems, integrity constraint checking, and materialized views. These applications are characterized by the existence at compile time of a predetermined set of queries, by a slow but persistent update traffic, and by their need to repetitively reevaluate the query set. The new approach represents a new type of intelligent database caching, which contrasts with traditional caching primarily in that the cache elements are derived data and as a consequence, they overlap arbitrarily and do not have a fixed length. The contents of the main memory cache are selected based on the data distribution within the database, the set of fixed queries to preprocess, and the paging characteristics. Page-answers and page-traces are used as the smallest indivisible units in the cache. An efficient heuristic. to select a near optimal set of page-answers and page-traces to populate the main memory has been developed, implemented, and tested. Finally, quantitative measurements of performance benefits are reported.

AB Introduction Artificial Intelligence (AI) platforms have gained widespread attention for their distinct ability to generate automated responses to various prompts. However, its role in assessing the quality and readability of a provided text remains unclear. Thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the proficiency of the conversational generative pre-trained transformer (ChatGPT) in utilizing the DISCERN tool to evaluate the quality of online content regarding shock wave therapy for erectile dysfunction. Methods Websites were generated using a Google search of "shock wave therapy for erectile dysfunction" with location filters disabled. Readability was analyzed using Readable software (Readable.com, Horsham, United Kingdom). Quality was assessed independently by three reviewers using the DISCERN tool. The same plain text files collected were inputted into ChatGPT to determine whether they produced comparable metrics for readability and quality. Results The study results revealed a notable disparity between ChatGPT's readability assessment and that obtained from a reliable tool, Readable.com (p<0.05). This indicates a lack of alignment between ChatGPT's algorithm and that of established tools, such as Readable.com. Similarly, the DISCERN score generated by ChatGPT differed significantly from the scores generated manually by human evaluators (p<0.05), suggesting that ChatGPT may not be capable of accurately identifying poor-quality information sources regarding shock wave therapy as a treatment for erectile dysfunction. Conclusion ChatGPT's evaluation of the quality and readability of online text regarding shockwave therapy for erectile dysfunction differs from that of human raters and trusted tools. Therefore, ChatGPT's current capabilities were not sufficient for reliably assessing the quality and readability of textual content. Further research is needed to elucidate the role of AI in the objective evaluation of online medical content in other fields. Continued development in AI and incorporation of tools such as DISCERN into AI software may enhance the way patients navigate the web in search of high-quality medical content in the future.

AB Background: Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT), an artificial intelligence (AI) program, is widely used for information compilation. This study sought to analyze the quality and consistency of the information generated by ChatGPT regarding common procedures for wrist arthritis.Methods: 32 standardized questions regarding wrist osteoarthritis and related procedures (4-corner-fusion [4CF], proximal row carpectomy [PRC], resurfacing capitate pyrocarbon implant, wrist denervation, and total wrist arthrodesis and arthroplasty) were presented to the ChatGPT-3.5 interface 3 separate times, without feedback. ChatGPT's answers were evaluated for medical accuracy by 3 reviewers and rated as "appropriate," "appropriate but incomplete," or "inappropriate." Ratings were then converted to numerical values to calculate an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). A DISCERN score was used to assess quality, and Flesch-Kincade Grade Level and Flesch Reading Ease Score for readability.Results: 75% of the responses were deemed "appropriate," with 23 questions receiving unanimous appropriate ratings across all responses. The ICC was 0.97 (95% CI [0.46, 0.98]), indicating excellent reliability. DISCERN score was 60 (good). The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level was 14.6 +/- 1.9, and the Flesch Reading Ease Score was 25.3 +/- 6.7, implying a college reading level. The information that ChatGPT provided for PRC and total wrist arthrodesis and arthroplasty, appeared to be more reliable than for 4CF and denervation.Conclusion: ChatGPT's reliability and accuracy of information varied across procedures, possibly due to unknown and diverse sources. Furthermore, while some answers were factually correct, many provided generic information across differing questions, limiting usefulness. ChatGPT must be used cautiously and the limitations understood.

AB The shortcoming of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and its variations have been highlighted in literature for quite some time. A critical limitation of these models is ignoring the social aspect, how situational and motivational involvement impact customers' adoption of these technologies. After the initial phase of novelty, an individual's Involvement with technology plays a crucial role in shaping their behavior regarding a technology. A more thorough comprehension of customers' experiences and the memorable and captivating moments they encounter is necessary to develop a comprehensive understanding of the adoption of service robots. Using motivation theory and the theory of conspicuous approach, we propose and test a novel model to examine the role of extrinsic and intrinsic motivation and social status on customers' attitudes and intention to use service robots during the pandemic. Using a sample of 525 U.S. hotel guests, we showed that motivation and social status positively influence customer attitude and, consequently, their intention to use service robots in hotels. Customer attitude fully mediates the relationship between variables in the model. Additionally, a multi-group analysis of involvement (low and high) indicated that guests' attitudes had a more substantial effect on their intention to use service robots for the high involvement group. Finally, with a linear regression model, we showed that the feelings of safety and comfort influence the customers' intention to use service robots during the pandemic. This study expands knowledge on technology adoption, motivation, and conspicuous consumption theories. It also provides valuable insight to hotel managers in better understanding what influences customer adoption of new technologies.

AB This paper introduces a spatially explicit random forests-based hedonic price modeling approach to account for spatial autocorrelation in the data. Spatial autocorrelation is a common data structure in georeferenced data, and controlling associations among spatial objects is crucial for accurate statistical analysis. Validations of machine learning and artificial intelligence applications require using out-of-sample data sets to assess models' fit on the training dataset. Previous research has shown that nonspatial cross-validation methods, commonly used in machine learning applications for spatial data, often provide over-optimistic results. Some recommended the use of spatial cross-validation methods to obtain more reliable estimates. However, the machine learning models used in these previous studies did not include spatially explicit parameters to account for spatial autocorrelation in the data. Unlike machine learning-based models, statistical-based models such as the spatial lag model can effectively account for spatial autocorrelation in the data. This research applied a two-stage least squares random forests framework to construct a hedonic pricing model incorporating a spatial lag for the Miami-Dade single-family residential parcel sales data. Random forests models are evaluated using K-fold, spatial blocking K-fold, and spatial leave-one-out cross-validation methods. The goodness-of-fit of the tested random forests-based models is evaluated using the coefficient of determination and mean square error scores. Additionally, spatial autocorrelations in residuals from random forests models are investigated by conducting Moran's I test. Our research indicates that failing to account for spatial autocorrelation in data can lead to unreliable and overly optimistic estimates. However, including a spatially lagged variable substantially reduces fluctuations in goodness-of-fit measures across different validation sets.

AB Purpose Root system architectures are complex and challenging to characterize effectively for agronomic and ecological discovery. Methods We propose a new method, Spatial and Texture Analysis of Root SystEm distribution with Earth mover's Distance (STARSEED), for comparing root system distributions that incorporates spatial information through a novel application of the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD). Results We illustrate that the approach captures the response of sesame root systems for different genotypes and soil moisture levels. STARSEED provides quantitative and visual insights into changes that occur in root architectures across experimental treatments. Conclusion STARSEED can be generalized to other plants and provides insight into root system architecture development and response to varying growth conditions not captured by existing root architecture metrics and models. The code and data for our experiments are publicly available: https://github.com/GatorSense/STARSEED.

TI Topological feature vectors for exploring topological relationships

ID QUERY
AB Topological relationships between spatial objects such as overlap, disjoint, and inside have for a long time been a focus of research in a number of disciplines like cognitive science, robotics, linguistics, artificial intelligence, and spatial reasoning. In particular as predicates, they support the design of suitable query languages for spatial data retrieval and analysis in spatial database systems and Geographic Information Systems. While conceptual aspects of topological predicates (like their definition and reasoning with them) as well as strategies for avoiding unnecessary or repetitive predicate evaluations (like predicate migration and spatial index structures) have been emphasized, the development of correct and efficient implementation techniques for them has been rather neglected. Recently, the design of topological predicates for different combinations of complex spatial data types has led to a large increase of their numbers and accentuated the need for their efficient implementation. The goal of this article is to develop efficient implementation techniques of topological predicates for all combinations of the complex spatial data types point2D, line2D, and region2D, as they have been specified by different authors and in different commercial and public domain software packages. Our solution is a two-phase approach. In the exploration phase, for a given scene of two spatial objects, all topological events like intersection and meeting situations are recorded in two precisely defined topological feature vectors (one for each argument object of a topological predicate) whose specifications are characteristic and unique for each combination of spatial data types. These vectors serve as input for the evaluation phase which analyzes the topological events and determines the Boolean result of a topological predicate or the kind of topological predicate. This paper puts an emphasis on the exploration phase and the definition of the topological feature vectors. In addition, it presents a straightforward evaluation method.

AB The Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) Think Tank XI was held on August 9-11, 2023 in Gainesville, Florida with the theme of "Pushing the Forefront of Neuromodulation". The keynote speaker was Dr. Nico Dosenbach from Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. He presented his research recently published in Nature inn a collaboration with Dr. Evan Gordon to identify and characterize the somato-cognitive action network (SCAN), which has redefined the motor homunculus and has led to new hypotheses about the integrative networks underpinning therapeutic DBS. The DBS Think Tank was founded in 2012 and provides an open platform where clinicians, engineers, and researchers (from industry and academia) can freely discuss current and emerging DBS technologies, as well as logistical and ethical issues facing the field. The group estimated that globally more than 263,000 DBS devices have been implanted for neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. This year's meeting was focused on advances in the following areas: cutting-edge translational neuromodulation, cutting-edge physiology, advances in neuromodulation from Europe and Asia, neuroethical dilemmas, artificial intelligence and computational modeling, time scales in DBS for mood disorders, and advances in future neuromodulation devices.

AB Cutaneous malignancies affecting the ear, exacerbated by extensive ultraviolet (UV) exposure, pose intricate challenges owing to the organ's complex anatomy. This article investigates how the anatomy contributes to late-stage diagnoses and ensuing complexities in surgical interventions. Mohs Micrographic Surgery (MMS), acknowledged as the gold standard for treating most cutaneous malignancies of the ear, ensures superior margin control and cure rates. However, the ear's intricacy necessitates careful consideration of tissue availability and aesthetic outcomes. The manuscript explores new technologies like Reflectance Confocal Microscopy (RCM), Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), High-Frequency, High-Resolution Ultrasound (HFHRUS), and Raman spectroscopy (RS). These technologies hold the promise of enhancing diagnostic accuracy and providing real-time visualization of excised tissue, thereby improving tumor margin assessments. Dermoscopy continues to be a valuable non-invasive tool for identifying malignant lesions. Staining methods in Mohs surgery are discussed, emphasizing hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) as the gold standard for evaluating tumor margins. Toluidine blue is explored for potential applications in assessing basal cell carcinomas (BCC), and immunohistochemical staining is considered for detecting proteins associated with specific malignancies. As MMS and imaging technologies advance, a thorough evaluation of their practicality, cost-effectiveness, and benefits becomes essential for enhancing surgical outcomes and patient care. The potential synergy of artificial intelligence with these innovations holds promise in revolutionizing tumor detection and improving the efficacy of cutaneous malignancy treatments.

AB Highly portable and accessible MRI technology will allow researchers to conduct field-based MRI research in community settings. Previous guidance for researchers working with fixed MRI does not address the novel ethical, legal, and societal issues (ELSI) of portable MRI (pMRI). Our interdisciplinary Working Group (WG) previously identified 15 core ELSI challenges associated with pMRI research and recommended solutions. In this article, we distill those detailed recommendations into a Portable MRI Research ELSI Checklist that offers practical operational guidance for researchers contemplating using this technology.

AB The Copernicus Sentinel -2 multispectral imagery data may be aggregated to extract large-scale, bare soil, reflectance composites, which enable soil mapping applications. In this paper, this approach was tested in the German federal state of Bavaria, to provide estimations for soil organic carbon (SOC). Different temporal ranges were considered for the generation of the composites, including multi -annual and seasonal ranges. A novel multichannel convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed. By leveraging the advantages of deep learning techniques, it utilizes complementary information from different spectral pre-treatment techniques. The SOC predictions indicated little dissimilarity amongst the different composites, with the best performance attained for the six -year composite containing only spring months (RMSE = 12.03 g C & sdot; kg - 1 , R 2 = 0.64, RPIQ = 0.89). It has been demonstrated that these outcomes outperform other well-known machine learning techniques. An ablation analysis was accordingly performed to evaluate the interplay of the CNN ' s different components to disentangle the advantages of each aspect of the proposed framework. Finally, a DUal inPut deep LearnIng architecture, named DUPLICITE, is proposed, which concatenates deep spectral features derived from the CNN mentioned earlier, as well as topographical and environmental covariates through an artificial neural network (ANN) to exploit their complementarity. The proposed approach was demonstrated to provide an improvement in the overall prediction performance (RMSE = 11.60 gC & sdot; kg - 1 , R 2 = 0.67, RPIQ = 0.92).

AB This paper explores the evolution of geoscientific inquiry, tracing the progression from traditional physics-based models to modern data-driven approaches facilitated by significant advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and data collection techniques. Traditional models, which are grounded in physical and numerical frameworks, provide robust explanations by explicitly reconstructing underlying physical processes. However, their limitations in comprehensively capturing Earth's complexities and uncertainties pose challenges in optimization and real-world applicability. In contrast, contemporary data-driven models, particularly those utilizing machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), leverage extensive geoscience data to glean insights without requiring exhaustive theoretical knowledge. ML techniques have shown promise in addressing Earth science-related questions. Nevertheless, challenges such as data scarcity, computational demands, data privacy concerns, and the "black-box" nature of AI models hinder their seamless integration into geoscience. The integration of physics-based and data-driven methodologies into hybrid models presents an alternative paradigm. These models, which incorporate domain knowledge to guide AI methodologies, demonstrate enhanced efficiency and performance with reduced training data requirements. This review provides a comprehensive overview of geoscientific research paradigms, emphasizing untapped opportunities at the intersection of advanced AI techniques and geoscience. It examines major methodologies, showcases advances in large-scale models, and discusses the challenges and prospects that will shape the future landscape of AI in geoscience. The paper outlines a dynamic field ripe with possibilities, poised to unlock new understandings of Earth's complexities and further advance geoscience exploration.

AB Spot spraying POST herbicides is an effective approach to reduce herbicide input and weed control cost. Machine vision detection of grass or grass-like weeds in turfgrass systems is a challenging task due to the similarity in plant morphology. In this work, we explored the feasibility of using image classification with deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN), including AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and VGGNet, for detection of crabgrass species (Digitariaspp.), doveweed [Murdannia nudiflora(L.) Brenan], dallisgrass (Paspalum dilatatumPoir.), and tropical signalgrass [Urochloa distachya(L.) T.Q. Nguyen] in bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon(L.) Pers.]. VGGNet generally outperformed AlexNet and GoogLeNet in detecting selected grassy weeds. For detection ofP. dilatatum, VGGNet achieved high F1 scores (>= 0.97) and recall values (>= 0.99). A single VGGNet model exhibited high F1 scores (>= 0.93) and recall values (1.00) that reliably detectedDigitariaspp.,M. nudiflora,P. dilatatum, andU. distachya. Low weed density reduced the recall values of AlexNet at detecting all weed species and GoogLeNet at detectingDigitaria spp. In comparison, VGGNet achieved excellent performances (overall accuracy = 1.00) at detecting all weed species in both high and low weed-density scenarios. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using DCNN for detection of grass or grass-like weeds in turfgrass systems.

ID RIDERSHIP
AB The assessment of bus stop amenities is important for providing fundamental data for public transit research, planning, and infrastructure enhancements. So far, public data on the amenities at bus stops have largely been unavailable. This study develops an automated, low-cost, and generalizable approach using Google Street View images and deep learning techniques to evaluate bus stop amenities. Leveraging the latest YOLOv8 model, transfer learning, and a dynamic prediction algorithm, our approach achieves efficient detection of shelters and benches with high accuracy and precision in major Florida cities. Results reveal highly heterogeneous spatial patterns for both shelters and benches within and across cities. Additionally, we conducted several tests to evaluate the transferability of the system to other urban contexts, which shows that highly accurate feature detection results can be achieved through model fine-tuning on a small sample of local data. In summary, the proposed system offers a scalable and efficient solution for large-scale real-time assessment of bus stop amenities, which can inform public transportation research and planning, especially for future transit infrastructure improvements.

AB Social cues have been construed as an important concept in human-robot interaction, as they can be manipulated to reflect robots' perceived genders, personalities, emotions, identities, and so on. This study seeks to understand the overall effects of social cues and applies two meta-analyses to explore a hierarchy of social cues that elicits different degrees of users' social responses. A total of 25 and 44 effect sizes were calculated to represent the respective magnitudes of the effects of social cues on users' social presence (N = 2498) and trust in social robots (N = 4147). Results suggested that although the overall effects of social cues were small, manipulating social robots' facial and kinetic cues can induce medium-to-large-sized effects on users' social presence and trust. In addition, the overall positive effect sizes of social cues indicated that designing humanlike, natural, and lifelike cues was effective in evoking users' social presence and trust in social robots. The results of the two meta-analyses can contribute to the theoretical implications of the Computers are Social Actors paradigm and the practical and methodological design of human-robot interaction.

ID NEURAL MECHANISMS; FEEDBACK
AB Emergency response (ER) workers perform extremely demanding physical and cognitive tasks that can result in serious injuries and loss of life. Human augmentation technologies have the potential to enhance physical and cognitive work-capacities, thereby dramatically transforming the landscape of ER work, reducing injury risk, improving ER, as well as helping attract and retain skilled ER workers. This opportunity has been significantly hindered by the lack of high-quality training for ER workers that effectively integrates innovative and intelligent augmentation solutions. Hence, new ER learning environments are needed that are adaptive, affordable, accessible, and continually available for reskilling the ER workforce as technological capabilities continue to improve. This article presents the research considerations in the design and integration of use-inspired exoskeletons and augmented reality technologies in ER processes and the identification of unique cognitive and motor learning needs of each of these technologies in context-independent and ER-relevant scenarios. We propose a human-centered artificial intelligence (AI) enabled training framework for these technologies in ER. Finally, how these human-centered training requirements for nascent technologies are integrated in an intelligent tutoring system that delivers across tiered access levels, covering the range of virtual, to mixed, to physical reality environments, is discussed.

AB The deep brain stimulation (DBS) Think Tank X was held on August 17-19, 2022 in Orlando FL. The session organizers and moderators were all women with the theme women in neuromodulation. Dr. Helen Mayberg from Mt. Sinai, NY was the keynote speaker. She discussed milestones and her experiences in developing depression DBS. The DBS Think Tank was founded in 2012 and provides an open platform where clinicians, engineers and researchers (from industry and academia) can freely discuss current and emerging DBS technologies as well as the logistical and ethical issues facing the field. The consensus among the DBS Think Tank X speakers was that DBS has continued to expand in scope however several indications have reached the "trough of disillusionment." DBS for depression was considered as "re-emerging" and approaching a slope of enlightenment. DBS for depression will soon re-enter clinical trials. The group estimated that globally more than 244,000 DBS devices have been implanted for neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. This year's meeting was focused on advances in the following areas: neuromodulation in Europe, Asia, and Australia; cutting-edge technologies, closed loop DBS, DBS tele-health, neuroethics, lesion therapy, interventional psychiatry, and adaptive DBS.

AB The 2023 Joint Annual Congress of the International Liver Transplantation Society, European Liver and Intestine Transplant Association, and Liver Intensive Care Group of Europe were held in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, from May 3 to 6, 2023. This year, all speakers were invited to attend the Congress in person for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic. The congress was attended by 1159 registered delegates from 54 countries representing 5 continents, with the 10 countries comprising the bulk of the delegates. Of the 647 abstracts initially submitted, 542 were eventually presented at the meeting, coming from 38 countries (mainly North America, Europe, and Asia) and 85% of them (462 abstracts) came from only 10 countries. Fifty-three (9.8%) abstracts, originated from 17 countries, were submitted under the Basic/Translational Scientific Research category, a similar percentage as in 2022. Abstracts presented at the meeting were classified as (1) ischemia and reperfusion injury, (2) machine perfusion, (3) bioengineering and liver regeneration, (4) transplant oncology, (5) novel biomarkers in liver transplantation, (6) liver immunology (rejection and tolerance), and (7) artificial intelligence and machine learning. Finally, we evaluated the number of abstracts commented in the Basic and Translational Research Committee-International Liver Transplantation Society annual reports over the past 5 y that resulted in publications in peer-reviewed journals to measure their scientific impact in the field of liver transplantation.

TI Emerging trends in managed care pharmacy: A mixed-method study
SO JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE & SPECIALTY PHARMACY
LA English
DT Article
ID COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE; EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB BACKGROUND: Over the past 5 years, managed care pharmacy has been shaped by a global pandemic, advancements in generative artificial intelligence (AI), Medicare drug price negotiation policies, and significant therapeutic developments. Collective intelligence methods can be used to anticipate future developments in practice to help organizations plan and develop new strategies around those changes. OBJECTIVE: To identify emerging trends in managed care pharmacy. METHODS: In this sequential mixed-method study, we invited experts to participate in a multidisciplinary advisory panel to develop a survey with 5 overarching domains. The qualitative analysis for our advisory panel meetings used a thematic analysis approach. To analyze the cross-sectional survey results, we used descriptive statistics and exploratory bivariate statistics to test for possible relationships with survey respondent demographics and likelihood predictions. To assess respondent opinions on the overall likelihood of an event occurring in the next 5 years, we combined "Highly likely/Somewhat likely" responses and compared with "Highly unlikely/Somewhat unlikely" responses. RESULTS: Following our advisory panel focus groups, a total of 53 scenarios were developed for inclusion in the quantitative survey under the domains of (1) information technology, (2) therapeutics and diagnostics, (3) payment models, (4) pharmacy operations, and (5) public policy. A total of 1,238 individuals were invited to participate in the survey. Of eligible participants, 201 complete survey responses were received for a final response rate of 16.2%. Survey participants rated increased use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists by at least 25%, at least 1 major data breach, more than 10 new orphan drug approvals, and AI use in more than half of prior authorization reviews as the most likely scenarios to occur in the next 5 years. Respondents identified the following broad issues as those most likely to impact their organizations (employers) in the next 5 years: federal and state policy changes impacting managed care, cell and gene therapies, impact of AI on managed care operations, and emerging payment models. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides valuable insights into the emerging trends that are expected to shape managed care pharmacy over the next 5 years. The integration of advanced technologies, such as AI, along with the increasing focus on specialty therapeutics, represents both opportunities and challenges for managed care organizations. However, areas with lower consensus highlight the need for caution in strategic planning.

AB Morphological profiling is a valuable tool in phenotypic drug discovery. The advent of high-throughput automated imaging has enabled the capturing of a wide range of morphological features of cells or organisms in response to perturbations at the single-cell resolution. Concurrently, significant advances in machine learning and deep learning, especially in computer vision, have led to substantial improvements in analyzing large-scale high-content images at high throughput. These efforts have facilitated understanding of compound mechanism of action, drug repurposing, characterization of cell morphodynamics under perturbation, and ultimately contributing to the development of novel therapeutics. In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in the field of morphological profiling. We summarize the image profiling analysis workflow, survey a broad spectrum of analysis strategies encompassing feature engineering- and deep learning-based approaches, and introduce publicly available benchmark datasets. We place a particular emphasis on the application of deep learning in this pipeline, covering cell segmentation, image representation learning, and multimodal learning. Additionally, we illuminate the application of morphological profiling in phenotypic drug discovery and highlight potential challenges and opportunities in this field.

ID EXTRACTION
AB Extra-label drug use in food animal medicine is authorized by the US Animal Medicinal Drug Use Clarification Act (AMDUCA), and estimated withdrawal intervals are based on published scientific pharmacokinetic data. Occasionally there is a paucity of scientific data on which to base a withdrawal interval or a large number of animals being treated, driving the need to test for drug residues. Rapid assay commercial farm-side tests are essential for monitoring drug residues in animal products to protect human health. Active ingredients, sensitivity, matrices, and species that have been evaluated for commercial rapid assay tests are typically reported on manufacturers' websites or in PDF documents that are available to consumers but may require a special access request. Additionally, this information is not always correlated with FDA-approved tolerances. Furthermore, parameter changes for these tests can be very challenging to regularly identify, especially those listed on websites or in documents that are not publicly available. Therefore, artificial intelligence plays a critical role in efficiently extracting the data and ensure current information. Extracting tables from PDF and HTML documents has been investigated both by academia and commercial tool builders. Research in text mining of such documents has become a widespread yet challenging arena in implementing natural language programming. However, techniques of extracting tables are still in their infancy and being investigated and improved by researchers. In this study, we developed and evaluated a data-mining method for automatically extracting rapid assay data from electronic documents. Our automatic electronic data extraction method includes a software package module, a developed pattern recognition tool, and a data mining engine. Assay details were provided by several commercial entities that produce these rapid drug residue assay tests. During this study, we developed a real-time conversion system and method for reflowing contents in these files for accessibility practice and research data mining. Embedded information was extracted using an AI technology for text extraction and text mining to convert to structured formats. These data were then made available to veterinarians and producers via an online interface, allowing interactive searching and also presenting the commercial test assay parameters in reference to FDA-approved tolerances.

AB Plant diseases often reduce crop yield and product quality; therefore, plant disease diagnosis plays a vital role in farmers' management decisions. Visual crop inspections by humans are time-consuming and challenging tasks and, practically, can only be performed in small areas at a given time, especially since many diseases have similar symptoms. An intelligent machine vision monitoring system for automatic inspection can be a great help for farmers in this regard. Although many algorithms have been introduced for plant disease diagnosis in recent years, a simple method relying on minimal information from the images is of interest for field conditions. In this study, a novel image processing algorithm and multi-class support vector machine (SVM) were used to diagnose and classify grape leaf diseases, i.e., black measles, black rot, and leaf blight. The area of disease symptoms was separated from the healthy parts of the leaf utilizing K-means clustering automatically, and then the features were extracted in three color models, namely RGB, HSV, and l*a*b. As an efficient classification method, SVM was used in this study, where principal component analysis (PCA) was performed for feature dimension reduction. Finally, the most important features were selected by the relief feature selection. Gray-level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM) features resulted in an accuracy of 98.71%, while feature dimension reduction using PCA resulted in an accuracy of 98.97%. The proposed method was compared with two deep learning methods, i. e., CNN and GoogleNet, which achieved classification accuracies of 86.82% and 94.05%, respectively, while the processing time for the proposed method was significantly shorter than those of these models.

AB Florida is the largest fresh tomato producer in the USA. Due to the subtropical climate, especially the hot and humid weather, the devastating tomato bacterial spot disease (TBS), caused by the bacteria Xanthomonas perforans, has been a threat to tomato crops for decades. Prevention through early disease detection is a crucial management strategy to minimise losses. Diagnostics for this disease that are commonly used are a visual diagnosis of disease symptoms or laboratory assays. These procedures are time-consuming, require specialised personnel, and are inefficient in detecting the disease in its early stages. Hyperspectral imaging provides a non-invasive tool for early disease detection in various crops. In this study, five optimised machine learning algorithms (MLAs), such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLSDA), Weighted K-Nearest Neighbours (W-KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Ensemble Boosting Tree (EBT), were utilised for early detection of TBS in transplant houses. Two normalisation procedures, a standardisation method, and unit vectorisation, were applied to preprocess the data in a dynamic range expansion process. The input variables to the models included time-lined events of disease progression and reduced datasets. To create the reduced datasets, a novel data reduction methodology was developed, which was able to identify 12 key (significant) wavelengths (from the 300 initial scans of the hyperspectral camera) that carry the highest weighted spectral components for accurately detecting TBS-affected plants. The PLSDA model presented the highest F1 score (90%) on early detection of TBS. (c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IAgrE.

AB Over the last decade, the number of cyber attacks targeting power systems and causing physical and economic damages has increased rapidly. Among them, false data injection attacks (FDIAs) are a class of cyber-attacks against power grid monitoring systems. Adversaries can successfully perform FDIAs to manipulate the power system state estimation (SE) by compromising sensors or modifying system data. SE is an essential process performed by the energy management system towards estimating unknown state variables based on system redundant measurements and network topology. SE routines include bad data detection algorithms to eliminate errors from the acquired measurements, e.g. in case of sensor failures. FDIAs can bypass BDD modules to inject malicious data vectors into a subset of measurements without being detected, and thus manipulate the results of the SE process. To overcome the limitations of traditional residual-based BDD approaches, data-driven solutions based on machine learning algorithms have been widely adopted for detecting malicious manipulation of sensor data due to their fast execution times and accurate results. This study provides a comprehensive review of the most up-to-date machine learning methods for detecting FDIAs against power system SE algorithms.

AB Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with thermal and multispectral imaging capabilities, which offer high spatial and temporal resolutions, are becoming increasingly valuable for timely crop monitoring and informed decision-making in precision agriculture. However, processing and extracting useful information from UAV images is often complex, time-consuming, and requires specialized software, which limits its broader adoption for practical field implementations. To address these challenges, the Agriculture Sensing and Artificial Intelligence (AgriSenAI), a user-friendly Python-based desktop application, was developed to automate processing and information extraction from UAV-acquired thermal and multispectral imagery. AgriSenAI was developed by integrating advanced image processing with geospatial analysis to streamline field and plot extraction, plant canopy detection, noise removal, and extraction of information at pixel, plot, and field scales. The application was designed and tested using UAV-based thermal and multispectral imagery collected daily for three years from a research field at the University of Florida's Tropical Research and Education Center in Homestead, Florida. The research field consisted of 12 plots of green beans and 12 plots of sweet corn. The processing time and accuracy of AgriSenAI were evaluated. Results showed that AgriSenAI had a very high level of accuracy in extracting pixel values and significantly reduced processing time and costs compared with traditional approaches involving commercial software. The streamlined AgriSenAI workflow produced reliable canopy temperature information and vegetation indices, demonstrating the capacity to handle large-scale datasets and enhance precision agriculture through improved efficiency and accuracy in remote sensing data processing and information extraction, which could potentially be used to inform timely and data-driven crop management decisions.

AB Heterogeneous ensemble learning has received increasing attention in building energy prediction research because it provides more stable and accurate predictions than the conventional single model -based methods. Although existing studies have proved the feasibility of adopting heterogeneous ensem-ble learning in building energy prediction, they have not fully explored the method of constructing an optimal heterogeneous ensemble learning model based on limited base model resources. This paper attempts to identify the optimal heterogeneous ensemble learning model for building energy prediction by using the exhaustive search method. Six machine learning methods are used as the alternative base model for constructing heterogeneous ensemble learning models. All 57 heterogeneous ensemble learn-ing models that can be built from the six base models are compared and the optimal model is identified. The hourly building energy prediction experiment is performed on an institutional building located at the University of Florida to verify the proposed exhaustive search method. Three modules representing dif-ferent semesters of the test building are developed and tested to examine the predictive performance of the proposed heterogeneous ensemble learning models. The research findings demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed exhaustive search method in identifying the optimal heterogeneous ensemble learning model. The optimal heterogeneous ensemble learning model found in this study can reduce the MAPE by 4.9% -6.6% compared with its most accurate base model in the model testing stage. The experimental results and research findings provide critical guidance for applying heterogeneous ensemble learning to data-driven building energy prediction. (c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB Hydrological drought forecasting is essential for effective water resource management planning. Innovations in computer science and artificial intelligence (AI) have been incorporated into Earth science research domains to improve predictive performance for water resource planning and disaster management. Forecasting of future hydrological drought can assist with mitigation strategies for various stakeholders. This study uses the transformer deep learning model to forecast hydrological drought, with a benchmark comparison with the long short-term memory (LSTM) model. These models were applied to the Apalachicola River, Florida, with two gauging stations located at Chattahoochee and Blountstown. Daily stage-height data from the period 1928-2022 were collected from these two stations. The two deep learning models were used to predict stage data for five different time steps: 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 days. A drought series was created from the forecasted values using a monthly fixed threshold of the 75th percentile (75Q). The transformer model outperformed the LSTM model for all of the timescales at both locations when considering the following averages: MSE = 0.11, MAE = 0.21, RSME = 0.31, and R-2 = 0.92 for the Chattahoochee station, and MSE = 0.06, MAE = 0.19, RSME = 0.23, and R-2 = 0.93 for the Blountstown station. The transformer model exhibited greater accuracy in generating the same drought series as the observed data after applying the 75Q threshold, with few exceptions. Considering the evaluation criteria, the transformer deep learning model accurately forecasts hydrological drought in the Apalachicola River, which could be helpful for drought planning and mitigation in this area of contested water resources, and likely has broad applicability elsewhere.

AB Remote sensing and machine learning (ML) could assist and support growers, stakeholders, and plant pathologists determine plant diseases resulting from viral, bacterial, and fungal infections. Spectral vegetation indices (VIs) have shown to be helpful for the indirect detection of plant diseases. The purpose of this study was to utilize ML models and identify VIs for the detection of downy mildew (DM) disease in watermelon in several disease severity (DS) stages, including low, medium (levels 1 and 2), high, and very high. Hyperspectral images of leaves were collected in the laboratory by a benchtop system (380-1,000 nm) and in the field by a UAV-based imaging system (380-1,000 nm). Two classification methods, multilayer perceptron (MLP) and decision tree (DT), were implemented to distinguish between healthy and DM-affected plants. The best classification rates were recorded by the MLP method; however, only 62.3% accuracy was observed at low disease severity. The classification accuracy increased when the disease severity increased (e.g., 86-90% for the laboratory analysis and 69-91% for the field analysis). The best wavelengths to differentiate between the DS stages were selected in the band of 531 nm, and 700-900 nm. The most significant VIs for DS detection were the chlorophyll green (Cl green), photochemical reflectance index (PRI), normalized phaeophytinization index (NPQI) for laboratory analysis, and the ratio analysis of reflectance spectral chlorophyll-a, b, and c (RARSa, RASRb, and RARSc) and the Cl green in the field analysis. Spectral VIs and ML could enhance disease detection and monitoring for precision agriculture applications.

AB Background: Common barriers to students' persistence in research include experiencing feelings of exclusion and a lack of belonging, difficulties developing a robust researcher identity, perceptions of racial and social stigma directed toward them, and perceived gaps in research skills, which are particularly pronounced among trainees from groups traditionally underrepresented in research. To address these known barriers, summer research programs have been shown to increase the participation and retention of undergraduate students in research. However, previous programs have focused predominantly on technical knowledge and skills, without integrating an academic enrichment curriculum that promotes professional development by improving students' academic and research communication skills. Objective: This retrospective pre-then-post study aimed to evaluate changes in self-reported ratings of research abilities among a cohort of undergraduate students who participated in a summer research program. Methods: The Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) piloted the implementation of a web-based academic enrichment curriculum for the Summer 2023 Research Internship cohort, which was comprised of students from groups underrepresented in biomedical artificial intelligence research. HuBMAP, a 400-member research consortium funded by the Common Fund at the National Institutes of Health, offered a 10-week summer research internship that included an academic enrichment curriculum delivered synchronously via the web to all students across multiple sites. The curriculum is intended to support intern self-efficacy, researcher identity development, and peer-to-peer learning. At the end of the internship, students were invited to participate in a web-based survey in which they were asked to rate their academic and research abilities before the internship and as a result of the internship using a modified Entering Research Learning Assessment instrument. Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test was performed to assess the difference in the mean scores per respondent before and after participating in the internship. Results: A total of 14 of the 22 undergraduate students who participated in the internship responded to the survey. The results of the retrospective pre-then-post survey indicated that there was a significant increase in students' self-rated research abilities, evidenced by a significant improvement in the mean scores of the respondents when comparing reported skills self-assessment before and after the internship (improvement: median 1.09, IQR 0.88-1.65; W=52.5, P<.001). After participating in the HuBMAP web-based academic enrichment curriculum, students' self-reported research abilities, including their confidence, their communication and collaboration skills, their self-efficacy in research, and their abilities to set research career goals, increased. Conclusions: Summer internship programs can incorporate an academic enrichment curriculum with small-group peer learning in addition to a laboratory-based experience to facilitate increased student engagement, self-efficacy, and a sense of belonging in the research community. Future research should investigate the impact of academic enrichment curricula and peer mentoring on the long-term retention of students in biomedical research careers, particularly retention of students underrepresented in biomedical fields.

ID ADAPTIVE-CONTROL; STABILITY; IDENTIFICATION
AB Several decades ago, Profs. Sean Meyn and Lei Guo were postdoctoral fellows at ANU, where they shared interest in recursive algorithms. It seems fitting to celebrate Lei Guo's 60th birthday with a review of the ODE Method and its recent evolution, with focus on the following themes: The method has been regarded as a technique for algorithm analysis. It is argued that this viewpoint is backwards: The original stochastic approximation method was surely motivated by an ODE, and tools for analysis came much later (based on establishing robustness of Euler approximations). The paper presents a brief survey of recent research in machine learning that shows the power of algorithm design in continuous time, following by careful approximation to obtain a practical recursive algorithm. While these methods are usually presented in a stochastic setting, this is not a prerequisite. In fact, recent theory shows that rates of convergence can be dramatically accelerated by applying techniques inspired by quasi Monte-Carlo. Subject to conditions, the optimal rate of convergence can be obtained by applying the averaging technique of Polyak and Ruppert. The conditions are not universal, but theory suggests alternatives to achieve acceleration. The theory is illustrated with applications to gradient-free optimization, and policy gradient algorithms for reinforcement learning.

AB High-resolution spatial imaging is transforming our understanding of foundational biology. Spatial metabolomics is an emerging field that enables the dissection of the complex metabolic landscape and heterogeneity from a thin tissue section. Currently, spatial metabolism highlights the remarkable complexity in two-dimensional (2D) space and is poised to be extended into the three-dimensional (3D) world of biology. Here we introduce MetaVision3D, a pipeline driven by computer vision, a branch of artificial intelligence focusing on image workflow, for the transformation of serial 2D MALDI mass spectrometry imaging sections into a high-resolution 3D spatial metabolome. Our framework uses advanced algorithms for image registration, normalization and interpolation to enable the integration of serial 2D tissue sections, thereby generating a comprehensive 3D model of unique diverse metabolites across host tissues at submesoscale. As a proof of principle, MetaVision3D was utilized to generate the mouse brain 3D metabolome atlas of normal and diseased animals (available at https://metavision3d.rc.ufl.edu) as an interactive online database and web server to further advance brain metabolism and related research.

AB COVID-19 has changed many aspects of the hospitality and tourism industry, including technology-oriented and contactless solutions. Despite the increasing number of service companies using robots on their premises, most of the previous attempts and practices of adoption have remained unsuccessful. Prior research hints that socioeconomic factors could influence the successful adoption of these emerging technologies. Nevertheless, these studies ignore the role of profile factors and assume a homogenous response to using robots in service operations during the pandemic. Based on the theory of diffusion of innovation and a sample of 525 participants, this study investigates the differences in customers' attitudes, their level of involvement, and optimism for service robots as well as their intentions to use service robots in the five main areas of hotel operations (front desk, concierge, housekeeping, room service, and food and beverage) based on five profile factors (age, gender, income level, education, and purpose of trip). MANOVA tests show significant differences in all variables based on demographic factors; male, younger, more educated, higher income, and leisure travelers show more positive attitudes, higher involvement, optimism, and intention to use service robots across various hotel departments. In particular, mean scores were found to be smaller for the traditionally human-oriented functional areas of the hotel operations. We also clustered the participants based on their level of comfort and optimism about using service robots in hotels. Given the rapid changes in the service industry and the increasing adoption of service robots, this paper adds a much-needed contribution to the ongoing research on service robots in the service industry by investigating the impact of profile factors on guests' behavior towards service robots.

AB As members of network systems share more information among agents and with network providers, sensitive data leakage raises privacy concerns. Motivated by such concerns, we introduce a novel mechanism that privatizes vectors belonging to the unit simplex. Such vectors can be found in many applications, such as privatizing a decision-making policy in a Markov decision process. We use differential privacy as the underlying mathematical framework for this work. The introduced mechanism is a probabilistic mapping that maps a vector within the unit simplex to the same domain using a Dirichlet distribution. We find the mechanism well-suited for inputs within the unit simplex because it always returns a privatized output that is also in the unit simplex. Therefore, no further projection back onto the unit simplex is required. We verify and quantify the privacy guarantees of the mechanism for three cases: identity queries, average queries, and general linear queries. We establish a trade-off between the level of privacy and the accuracy of the mechanism output, and we introduce a parameter to balance the trade-off between them. Numerical results illustrate the proposed mechanism.

AB The purpose of this article is to review steatosis and fibrosis of skeletal muscle, focusing on older adults. Although CT, MRI, and ultrasound are commonly used to image skeletal muscle and provide diagnoses for a variety of medical conditions, quantitative assessment of muscle steatosis and fibrosis is uncommon. This review provides radiologists with a broad perspective on muscle steatosis and fibrosis in older adults by considering the public health impact, biologic mechanisms, and evaluation with CT, MRI, and ultrasound. Promising directions in clinical research that entail artificial intelligence algorithms and the imaging assessment of biologic age are also reviewed. The imaging methods presented hold promise for improving the evaluation of common conditions affecting older adults, including sarcopenia, frailty, and cachexia.

AB The meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) framework, which involves RL over multiple timescales, has been successful in training deep RL models that generalize to new environments. It has been hypothesized that the prefrontal cortex may mediate meta-RL in the brain, but the evidence is scarce. Here we show that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) mediates meta-RL. We trained mice and deep RL models on a probabilistic reversal learning task across sessions during which they improved their trial-by-trial RL policy through meta-learning. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-dependent synaptic plasticity in OFC was necessary for this meta-learning but not for the within-session trial-by-trial RL in experts. After meta-learning, OFC activity robustly encoded value signals, and OFC inactivation impaired the RL behaviors. Longitudinal tracking of OFC activity revealed that meta-learning gradually shapes population value coding to guide the ongoing behavioral policy. Our results indicate that two distinct RL algorithms with distinct neural mechanisms and timescales coexist in OFC to support adaptive decision-making.
   The authors show that neural activity and synaptic plasticity in the orbitofrontal cortex mediate multiple timescales of reinforcement learning (RL) for meta-RL, which parallels a form of meta-RL in artificial intelligence.

AB Management of diabetes requires a multifaceted approach of risk factor reduction; through management of risk factors such as glucose, blood pressure and cholesterol. Goals for these risk factors often vary and guidelines suggest that this is based on patient characteristics and need to be individualized. Evaluating risk is therefore critically important to determine goals and choose appropriate treatments.A risk engine is an analytic tool that collects a large amount of population data allowing the simulation of the progression of diabetes with set equations over a period of time. Recently, a number of data cohorts have become available, leading to the development of newer risk engines that are more dynamic and generalizable. An example is the Building, Relating, Assessing, and Validating Outcomes in (BRAVO) diabetes model which was built on the ACCORD trial database. It is capable of accurately predicting diabetes comorbidities in an international population based on calibration with international clinical trial data. It has potential uses in risk stratification of patients, evaluation of interventions and calculation of their long term cost effectiveness. Recently, it has been used to simulate long term outcomes based on short term data, using difference modelling scenarios.

AB Deep learning is revolutionizing various domains and significantly impacting medical image analysis. Despite notable progress, numerous challenges remain, necessitating the refinement of deep learning algorithms for optimal performance in medical image analysis. This paper explores the growing demand for precise and robust medical image analysis by focusing on an advanced deep learning technique, multistage transfer learning. Over the past decade, multistage transfer learning has emerged as a pivotal strategy, particularly in overcoming challenges associated with limited medical data and model generalization. However, the absence of well-compiled literature capturing this development remains a notable gap in the field. This exhaustive investigation endeavors to address this gap by providing a foundational understanding of how multistage transfer learning approaches confront the unique challenges posed by insufficient medical image datasets. The paper offers a detailed analysis of various multistage transfer learning types, architectures, methodologies, and strategies deployed in medical image analysis. Additionally, it delves into intrinsic challenges within this framework, providing a comprehensive overview of the current state while outlining potential directions for advancing methodologies in future research. This paper underscores the transformative potential of multistage transfer learning in medical image analysis, providing valuable guidance to researchers and healthcare professionals.

AB The complexity of transplant medicine pushes the boundaries of innate, human reasoning. From networks of immune modulators to dynamic pharmacokinetics to variable postoperative graft survival to equitable allocation of scarce organs, machine learning promises to inform clinical decision making by deciphering prodigious amounts of available data. This paper reviews current research describing how algorithms have the potential to augment clinical practice in solid organ transplantation. We provide a general introduction to different machine learning techniques, describing their strengths, limitations, and barriers to clinical implementation. We summarize emerging evidence that recent advances that allow machine learning algorithms to predict acute post-surgical and long-term outcomes, classify biopsy and radiographic data, augment pharmacologic decision making, and accurately represent the complexity of host immune response. Yet, many of these applications exist in pre-clinical form only, supported primarily by evidence of single-center, retrospective studies. Prospective investigation of these technologies has the potential to unlock the potential of machine learning to augment solid organ transplantation clinical care and health care delivery systems.

AB This study was performed to analyze the accuracy of health-related information on Twitter during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Authors queried Twitter on three dates for information regarding COVID-19 and five terms (cure, emergency or emergency room, prevent or prevention, treat or treatments, vitamins or supplements) assessing the first 25 results with health-related information. Tweets were authoritative if written by governments, hospitals, or physicians. Two physicians assessed each tweet for accuracy. Metrics were compared between accurate and inaccurate tweets using chi(2) analysis and Mann-Whitney U. A total of 25.4% of tweets were inaccurate. Accurate tweets were more likely written by Twitter authenticated authors (49.8% vs. 20.9%, 28.9% difference, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 17.7-38.2) with accurate tweet authors having more followers (19,491 vs. 7346; 3446 difference, 95% CI: 234-14,054) versus inaccurate tweet authors. Likes, retweets, tweet length, botometer scores, writing grade level, and rank order did not differ between accurate and inaccurate tweets. We found 1/4 of health-related COVID-19 tweets inaccurate indicating that the public should not rely on COVID-19 health information written on Twitter. Ideally, improved government regulatory authority, public/private industry oversight, independent fact-checking, and artificial intelligence algorithms are needed to ensure inaccurate information on Twitter is removed.

AB We report a conjugated polyelectrolyte fluorescence-based biosensor P-C-3 and a general methodology to evaluate spectral shape recognition to identify biomolecules using artificial intelligence. By using well-defined analytes, we demonstrate that the fluorescence spectral shape of P-C-3 is sensitive to minor structural changes and exhibits distinct signature patterns for different analytes. A method was also developed to select useful features to reduce computational complexity and prevent overfitting of the data. It was found that the normalized intensity of 3 to 5 selected wavelengths was sufficient for the fluorescence biosensor to classify 13 distinct nucleotides and distinguish as little as single base substitutions at distinct positions in the primary sequence of oligonucleotides rapidly with nearly 100% classification accuracy. Photophysical studies led to a model to explain the mechanism of these fluorescence spectral shape changes, which provides theoretical support for applying this method in complicated biological systems. Using the feature selection algorithm to measure the relative intensity of a few selected wavelengths significantly reduces measurement time, demonstrating the potential for fluorescence spectrum shape analysis in high-throughput and high-content screening.

TI Deep learning-based postharvest strawberry bruise detection under UV and
   incandescent light
SO COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
DE Artificial intelligence; Image processing; Strawberry bruising; UV
AB Bruising is one of the major defects of strawberries. Strawberry bruised areas are often visible as flattened, sunken, and discolored. Postharvest strawberries can be bruised by compression, impact, or vibration forces during harvesting, transportation, and packinghouse operations. These bruises make strawberries more vulnerable to rot or disease, thus shortening their shelf life. Bruises can also cause consumers to abandon pur-chase decisions. Therefore, inspecting strawberry bruises is an important procedure for commercial strawberry farms to guarantee the high quality of strawberries sent to the market. A novel technique was developed in this study to detect bruises on strawberry images captured by a color camera under incandescent and ultraviolet (UV) light. Mask Region-Based Convolutional Neural Networks (Mask R-CNN), a deep learning method, was utilized for the strawberry bruise detection. Four bruise severities were classified according to the estimated bruise ratio of every single strawberry (Minor Bruise, Light Bruise, Moderate Bruise, and Severe Bruise). The results showed that Mask R-CNN could accurately detect whether a strawberry is bruised or not under both lighting conditions. However, the strawberry bruise severity classification accuracy of the proposed machine vision technique was improved significantly under UV light compared to incandescent light. For whole strawberry bruise detection under UV light, the F1 score for detecting strawberry bruises was 0.99, and the highest F1 score for whole strawberry bruise severity classification was 0.92 for Minor Bruise. This strawberry bruise detection system can assist farmers in detecting bruised strawberries on the processing line or an automated strawberry harvester, improve the quality of strawberries that are sent to the market, and avoid shortening the shelf life of fresh strawberries.

AB New advancements in technology have made machines teachers, or technology-powered robots or AI that assist in the overall learning experience, a possibility. Though adoption rates are currently low, colleges and universities will likely incorporate some aspects of machine teachers (e.g., AI, robots) in their curriculums in the foreseeable future. However, little is known about how to create an effective machine teacher-based education. As an initial step, the present study examines whether an AI instructor's communication style would have an impact on students' perceptions about an AI instructor-based education. To test this inquiry, the study conducted an online experiment using a 2 (communication styles: functional vs. relational) x 2 (course topic: natural science vs. social science) between-subjects design. Primary results indicate that students develop more favorable perceptions about an AI instructor-based education when the AI instructor is relational rather than functional. This tendency is particularly strong when listening to a social science lecture. Further, social presence of an AI instructor functions as a mediator, which explains the reason why a relational AI instructor leads to more favorable perceptions about an AI instructor-based education is because of one's social presence of an AI instructor. Collectively, the study's findings indicate the importance of communication styles and social presence of an AI instructor.

AB The spittlebug (Aeneolamia varia) is one of the most important sugarcane pests in Colombia, where a recent increase in population and distribution specially in southwestern Colombia have led to the need for new technologies for integrated pest management. The objectives of this study were to determine the spatial distribution of this pest in commercial sugarcane fields and to validate machine learning (ML) tools for indirect injury detection and impact on yield (damage) using satellite images. This study was carried out in fields grown with the CC 01-1940 variety in El Cerrito, Valle del Cauca, Colombia, where systematic sampling of the populations (number of adults and nymphs per stem) was carried out. The spatial aggregation and distribution were determined using Moran's index and point patterns, sequence observations, and analysis with distance indicators (Sadie). The indirect injury detection and quantification of the impact on production were carried out with a ML approach using satellite image products with 10 m spatial and five days temporal resolutions, obtained from a Sentinel-2 sensor using Google Earth Engine. The results indicated that spittlebug populations had an aggregate spatial behavior and high spatial dependence. In addition, the ML algorithms predicted spittlebug injury, and the effect on production was estimated at 26.4 tons of cane per hectare, which represented a 17% reduction in the expected yield. The use of spatial analysis and remote sensing tools are an alternative for indirect detection of injury and for understanding population dynamics of the pest in sugarcane, so they can become instrumental for decision-making on an integrated pest management program.

AB Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) generated a global public health emergency since December 2019, causing huge economic losses. To help radiologists strengthen their recognition of COVID-19 cases, we developed a computer-aided diagnosis system based on deep learning to automatically classify chest computed tomography-based COVID-19, Tuberculosis, and healthy control subjects. Our novel classification model AdaD-FNN sequentially transfers the trained knowledge of an FNN estimator to the next FNN estimator while updating the weights of the samples in the training set with a decaying learning rate. This model inhibits the network from remembering the noisy information and improves the learning of complex patterns in the hard-to-identify samples. Moreover, we designed a novel image preprocessing model F-U2MNet-C by enhancing the image features using fuzzy stacking and eliminating the interference factors using U2MNet segmentation. Extensive experiments are conducted on four publicly available datasets namely, TLDCA, UCSD-Al4H, SARS-CoV-2, TCIA, and the obtained classification accuracies are 99.52%, 92.96%, 97.86%, 91.97%. Our novel system gives out compelling performance for assisting COVID-19 detection when compared with 22 state-of-the-art methods. We hope to help link together biomedical research and artificial intelligence and to assist the diagnosis of doctors, radiologists, and inspectors at each epidemic prevention site in the real world.

AB Facial expressions are essential in animal communication, and facial expression-based pain scales have been developed for different species. Automated pain recognition offers a valid alternative to manual annotation with growing evidence across species. This study applied machine learning (ML) methods, using a pre-trained VGG-16 base and a Support Vector Machine classifier to automate pain recognition in caprine patients in hospital settings, evaluating different frame extraction rates and validation techniques. The study included goats of different breed, age, sex, and varying medical conditions presented to the University of Florida's Large Animal Hospital. Painful status was determined using the UNESP-Botucatu Goat Acute Pain Scale. The final dataset comprised images from 40 goats (20 painful, 20 non-painful), with 2,253 'non-painful' and 3,154 'painful' images at 1 frame per second (FPS) extraction rate and 7,630 'non-painful' and 9,071 'painful' images at 3 FPS. Images were used to train deep learning-based models with different approaches. The model input was raw images, and pain presence was the target attribute (model output). For the single train-test split and 5-fold cross-validation, the models achieved approximately 80% accuracy, while the subject-wise 10-fold cross-validation showed mean accuracies above 60%. These findings suggest ML's potential in goat pain assessment.

AB Climate change involves long term changes in climate including increase in temperature, elevated CO2 and uneven distribution of rainfall quantity and periodicity. Though daily mean temperature (T-mean) is considered a widely useful index of assessment of climate change, averaging can obscure some of the variations expected in diurnal temperature range (DTR). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of DTR relative to T-mean as a metric for predicting millet yield using a combination of a historical dataset (1980-2010) and two climate model (MIROC5 and GFDL) projections for 2017-2046 under RCP 4.5 and 8.5 across two different environments (arid, Layyah and semi-arid, Faisalabad) of Punjab, Pakistan. Provincial datasets of pearl millet yields were collected and checked for an empirical relationship between T-mean, DTR and crop yield. The mean of projections showed increasing DTR relative to baseline in both environments. Projected T-max and T-min were highly correlated (0.90-0.99) for both environments and climate models. MIROC5 predicted T-max and T-min well and GFDL performed efficiently in predicting precipitation by 2046. The data also showed more hot days in future decades and erractic rainfall pattern by 2046 in both environments. The Genetic Algorithm (GA) appeared to be a good approach to assess climate change impact on pearl millet yield in Punjab, Pakistan, predicting negative yield impacts (11-12%) due to future warming. We suggest broadening tests of this method to other cases around the world, with similar climate regimes.

AB This study presents a methodological framework for predicting soil organic carbon (SOC) using laboratory spectral recordings from a handheld near-infrared (NIR, 1350-2550 nm) device combined with open geospatial data derived from remote sensing sensors related to landform, climate, and vegetation. Initial experiments proved the superiority of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using only spectral data captured by the low-cost spectral devices reaching an R2 of 0.62, RMSE of 0.31 log-SOC, and an RPIQ of 1.87. Furthermore, the incorporation of geo-covariates with Neo-Spectra data substantially enhanced predictive capabilities, outperforming existing approaches. Although the CNN-derived spectral features had the greatest contribution to the model, the geo-covariates that were most informative to the model were primarily the rainfall data, the valley bottom flatness, and the snow probability. The results demonstrate that hybrid modeling approaches, particularly using CNNs to preprocess all features and fit prediction models with Extreme Gradient Boosting trees, CNN-XGBoost, significantly outperformed traditional machine learning methods, with a notable RMSE reduction, reaching an R2 of 0.72, and an RPIQ of 2.17. The findings of this study highlight the effectiveness of multimodal data integration and hybrid models in enhancing predictive accuracy for SOC assessments. Finally, the application of interpretable techniques elucidated the contributions of various climatic and topographical factors to predictions, as well as spectral information, underscoring the complex interactions affecting SOC variability.

AB Purpose of ReviewTo provide an overview of the impact of virtual and augmented reality in contemporary cardiovascular medical practice.Recent FindingsThe utilization of virtual and augmented reality has emerged as an innovative technique in various cardiovascular subspecialties, including interventional adult, pediatric, and adult congenital as well as structural heart disease and heart failure. In particular, electrophysiology has proven valuable for both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The incorporation of 3D reconstruction modeling has significantly enhanced our understanding of patient anatomy and morphology, thereby improving diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.SummaryThe interactive modeling of cardiac structure and function within the virtual realm plays a pivotal role in comprehending complex congenital, structural, and coronary pathology. This, in turn, contributes to safer interventions and surgical procedures. Noteworthy applications include septal defect device closure, transcatheter valvular interventions, and left atrial occlusion device implantation. The implementation of virtual reality has been shown to yield cost savings in healthcare, reduce procedure time, minimize radiation exposure, lower intravenous contrast usage, and decrease the extent of anesthesia required. These benefits collectively result in a more efficient and effective approach to patient care.

ID SELECTION
AB In this paper, we propose an application customized network slicing mechanism to cope with dynamic traffic in future networks and various service requirements for network users, namely, context-aware network slicing (CANS). The resource allocation is carried out in frequency (f), space (s) and time (t) domains (referred to as three domains (3D) resource allocation) while the customization targets at low latency and high reliability, characteristic for IoT applications. We first formulate CANS as a two-step matching game with unknown preferences for access and back-haul networks. To dynamically resize mobile users' network slices (NSs), we propose application customized CANS++ method based on a coalition game to minimize the hand-off risk in the network. We then develop two-step stable matching (TSSM) and $\epsilon$-Pareto stability techniques to find the solutions to CANS and CANS++, respectively. To improve energy and cost efficiency, an artificial intelligence-based Dynamic Network Architecture (DNA) with ON/OFF scheduling (AI-DOS) is proposed to dynamically maximize NS utilization. Finally, we carry out extensive numerical analysis and demonstrate that context-aware 3D network slicing and resizing schemes can improve at least three times the users' utilities. These utilities are enhanced up to 180% by minimizing their hand-off risk. Furthermore, NS shrinking technique can reduce the number of active nodes (controlled in the s-domain) by factor five while the average utility of macro base stations, controlled in the t-domain, is improved between 70% and 500%.

AB Background Perhaps nowhere else in the healthcare system than in the intensive care unit environment are the challenges to create useful models with direct time-critical clinical applications more relevant and the obstacles to achieving those goals more massive. Machine learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to define states and predict future events are commonplace activities of modern life. However, their penetration into acute care medicine has been slow, stuttering and uneven. Major obstacles to widespread effective application of AI approaches to the real-time care of the critically ill patient exist and need to be addressed.Main body Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) in acute and critical care environments support clinicians, not replace them at the bedside. As will be discussed in this review, the reasons are many and include the immaturity of AI-based systems to have situational awareness, the fundamental bias in many large databases that do not reflect the target population of patient being treated making fairness an important issue to address and technical barriers to the timely access to valid data and its display in a fashion useful for clinical workflow. The inherent "black-box" nature of many predictive algorithms and CDSS makes trustworthiness and acceptance by the medical community difficult. Logistically, collating and curating in real-time multidimensional data streams of various sources needed to inform the algorithms and ultimately display relevant clinical decisions support format that adapt to individual patient responses and signatures represent the efferent limb of these systems and is often ignored during initial validation efforts. Similarly, legal and commercial barriers to the access to many existing clinical databases limit studies to address fairness and generalizability of predictive models and management tools.Conclusions AI-based CDSS are evolving and are here to stay. It is our obligation to be good shepherds of their use and further development.

AB Timely, accurate maps of invasive plant species are critical for making appropriate management decisions to eliminate emerging target populations or contain infestations. High-resolution aerial imagery is routinely used to map, monitor, and detect invasive plant populations. While conventional image interpretation involving human analysts is straightforward, it can require high demands for time and resources to produce useful intelligence. We compared the performance of human analysts with a custom Retinanet-based deep convolutional neural network (DNN) for detecting individual miconia (Miconia calvescens DC) plants, using high-resolution unmanned aerial system (UAS) imagery collected over lowland tropical forests in Hawai'i. Human analysts (n = 38) examined imagery at three linear scrolling speeds (100, 200 and 300 px/s), achieving miconia detection recalls of 74 +/- 3%, 60 +/- 3%, and 50 +/- 3%, respectively. The DNN achieved 83 +/- 3% recall and completed the image analysis in 1% of the time of the fastest scrolling speed tested. Human analysts could discriminate large miconia leaf clusters better than isolated individual leaves, while the DNN detection efficacy was independent of leaf cluster size. Optically, the contrast in the red and green color channels and all three (i.e., red, green, and blue) signal to clutter ratios (SCR) were significant factors for human detection, while only the red channel contrast, and the red and green SCRs were significant factors for the DNN. A linear cost analysis estimated the operational use of a DNN to be more cost effective than human photo interpretation when the cumulative search area exceeds a minimum area. For invasive species like miconia, which can stochastically spread propagules across thousands of ha, the DNN provides a more efficient option for detecting incipient, immature miconia across large expanses of forested canopy. Increasing operational capacity for large-scale surveillance with a DNN-based image analysis workflow can provide more rapid comprehension of invasive plant abundance and distribution in forested watersheds and may become strategically vital to containing these invasions.

DRAGON-AI can generate textual and logical ontology components, drawing from existing knowledge in multiple ontologies and unstructured text sources.ResultsWe assessed performance of DRAGON-AI on de novo term construction across ten diverse ontologies, making use of extensive manual evaluation of results. Our method has high precision for relationship generation, but has slightly lower precision than from logic-based reasoning. Our method is also able to generate definitions deemed acceptable by expert evaluators, but these scored worse than human-authored definitions. Notably, evaluators with the highest level of confidence in a domain were better able to discern flaws in AI-generated definitions. We also demonstrated the ability of DRAGON-AI to incorporate natural language instructions in the form of GitHub issues.ConclusionsThese findings suggest DRAGON-AI's potential to substantially aid the manual ontology construction process. However, our results also underscore the importance of having expert curators and ontology editors drive the ontology generation process.

TI RVIP: an indistinguishable approach to scalable network simulation at
   real time
SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
LA English
DT Article
DE hybrid network simulation; virtual protocol stack; no topological
   constraint; zero live node change
AB In the hybrid simulation research, we investigate a new approach to build software virtual networks (SVNs) that are indistinguishable from their equivalent real live networks (LNs). We define the concept of 'Network's Interactive Turing Test' based on the similar concept used in the artificial intelligence areas. Our goal is to actualize the interactive and indistinguishable real-virtual interface pair (RVIP) for large-scale computer network simulations. By RVIP's support, a single SVN is indistinguishable from its equivalent LN. In the entire hybrid system, multiple LNs and multiple SVNs are connected using many RVIPs in an arbitrary topology and at real time. To actualize RVIP, the following necessary conditions must be satisfied: (i) the performance of the underlying simulation platform must be faster than real time; (ii) all needed changes incurred by introducing any SVN into an LN scenario are put on the simulation's side. To interact with an SVN, RVIP requires that no change is made on any live node; (iii) an SVN does not exchange simulation events with LNs, that is, only standard IP protocol interactions between SVN and LN are allowed. (iv) Any LN can be dynamically plugged into the hybrid scenario at real time, just like being plugged into an equivalent purely LN. Compared with existing hybrid simulation efforts on NS-3, QualNet's EXata and OPNET's system-in-the-loop, in this paper, we use the actual RVIP implementation to show that RVIP is a better candidate to pass the Network's Interactive Turing Test owing to the following two advantages: (i) an interactive network tester can easily distinguish the existing hybrid networks from the LNs by using a live topology that cannot be simulated, for example, by including the entire live Internet. But RVIP is not vulnerable to such tests. RVIP can support hybrid scenarios with multiple SVNs and multiple LNs connected by an arbitrary network topology, and with the LNs on and off at anytime. (ii) Performance-wise, our studies show that RVIP provides more efficient support in terms of common metrics such as larger throughput limit and smaller extra latency; thus, the simulated SVNs are more indistinguishable from their live counterparts.

AB Tomato crops are susceptible to multiple diseases, several of which may be present during the same season. Therefore, rapid disease identification could enhance crop management consequently increasing the yield. In this study, nondestructive methods were developed to detect diseases that affect tomato crops, such as bacterial spot (BS), target spot (TS), and tomato yellow leaf curl (TYLC) for two varieties of tomato (susceptible and tolerant to TYLC only) by using hyperspectral sensing in two conditions: a) laboratory (benchtop scanning), and b) in field using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV-based). The stepwise discriminant analysis (STDA) and the radial basis function were applied to classify the infected plants and distinguish them from noninfected or healthy (H) plants. Multiple vegetation indices (VIs) and the M statistic method were utilized to distinguish and classify the diseased plants. In general, the classification results between healthy and diseased plants were highly accurate for all diseases; for instance, when comparing H vs. BS, TS, and TYLC in the asymptomatic stage and laboratory conditions, the classification rates were 94%, 95%, and 100%, respectively. Similarly, in the symptomatic stage, the classification rates between healthy and infected plants were 98% for BS, and 99-100% for TS and TYLC diseases. The classification results in the field conditions also showed high values of 98%, 96%, and 100%, for BS, TS, and TYLC, respectively. The VIs that could best identify these diseases were the renormalized difference vegetation index (RDVI), and the modified triangular vegetation index 1 (MTVI 1) in both laboratory and field. The results were promising and suggest the possibility to identify these diseases using remote sensing.

AB The development of a sustainable water quality monitoring system at national scale remains a big challenge until today, acting as a hindrance for the efficient implementation of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). This work provides valuable insights into the current state-of-the-art Earth Observation (EO) tools and services, proposing a synergistic use of innovative remote sensing technologies, in situ sensors, and databases, with the ultimate goal to support the European Member States in effective WFD implementation. The proposed approach is based on a recent research and scientific analysis for a six-year period (2017-2022) after reviewing 71 peer-reviewed articles in international journals coupled with the scientific results of 11 European-founded research projects related to EO and WFD. Special focus is placed on the EO data sources (spaceborne, in situ, etc.), the sensors in use, the observed water Quality Elements as well as on the computer science techniques (machine/deep learning, artificial intelligence, etc.). The combination of the different technologies can offer, among other things, low-cost monitoring, an increase in the monitored Quality Elements per water body, and a minimization of the percentage of water bodies with unknown ecological status.

Besides, drug screening is a high-cost and time-consuming process which requires innovative approaches to facilitate drug development rate. Benefiting from consistent technical advances in 3D bioprinting techniques, droplet-based 3D bioprinting techniques have been broadly utilized in pharmaceutics due to the noncontact printing mechanism and precise control on the deposition position of droplets. More specifically, cell-free/cell-laden bioinks which are deposited for the fabrication of drug carriers/3D tissue constructs have been broadly utilized for precise drug delivery and high throughput drug screening, respectively. This review summarizes the mechanism of various droplet-based 3D bioprinting techniques and the most up-to-date applications in drug delivery and screening and discusses the potential improvements of droplet-based 3D bioprinting techniques from both technical and material aspects. Through technical innovations, materials development, and the assistance from artificial intelligence, the formation process of drug carriers will be more stable and accurately controlled guaranteeing precise drug delivery. Meanwhile, the shape fidelity and uniformity of the printed tissue models will be significantly improved ensuring drug screening efficiency and efficacy.

TI A large language model for electronic health records
SO NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB There is an increasing interest in developing artificial intelligence (AI) systems to process and interpret electronic health records (EHRs). Natural language processing (NLP) powered by pretrained language models is the key technology for medical AI systems utilizing clinical narratives. However, there are few clinical language models, the largest of which trained in the clinical domain is comparatively small at 110 million parameters (compared with billions of parameters in the general domain). It is not clear how large clinical language models with billions of parameters can help medical AI systems utilize unstructured EHRs. In this study, we develop from scratch a large clinical language model-GatorTron-using > 90 billion words of text (including > 82 billion words of de-identified clinical text) and systematically evaluate it on five clinical NLP tasks including clinical concept extraction, medical relation extraction, semantic textual similarity, natural language inference (NLI), and medical question answering (MQA). We examine how (1) scaling up the number of parameters and (2) scaling up the size of the training data could benefit these NLP tasks. GatorTron models scale up the clinical language model from 110 million to 8.9 billion parameters and improve five clinical NLP tasks (e.g., 9.6% and 9.5% improvement in accuracy for NLI and MQA), which can be applied to medical AI systems to improve healthcare delivery.

AB With Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly permeating various aspects of society, including healthcare, the adoption of the Transformers neural network architecture is rapidly changing many applications. Transformer is a type of deep learning architecture initially developed to solve general-purpose Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks and has subsequently been adapted in many fields, including healthcare. In this survey paper, we provide an overview of how this architecture has been adopted to analyze various forms of healthcare data, including clinical NLP, medical imaging, structured Electronic Health Records (EHR), social media, biophysiological signals, biomolecular sequences. Furthermore, which have also include the articles that used the transformer architecture for generating surgical instructions and predicting adverse outcomes after surgeries under the umbrella of critical care. Under diverse settings, these models have been used for clinical diagnosis, report generation, data reconstruction, and drug/protein synthesis. Finally, we also discuss the benefits and limitations of using transformers in healthcare and examine issues such as computational cost, model interpretability, fairness, alignment with human values, ethical implications, and environmental impact.

AB Marine resource management is shifting from optimizing single species yield to redefining sustainable fisheries within the context of managing ocean use and ecosystem health. In this introductory article to the theme set, Plugging spatial ecology into ecosystem-based management (EBM) we conduct an informal horizon scan with leaders in EBM research to identify three rapidly evolving areas that will be game changers in integrating spatial ecology into EBM. These are: (1) new data streams from fishers, genomics, and technological advances in remote sensing and bio-logging; (2) increased analytical power through Big Data and artificial intelligence; and (3) better integration of social dimensions into management. We address each of these areas by first imagining capacity in 20 years from now, and then highlighting emerging efforts to get us there, drawing on articles in this theme set, other scientific literature, and presentations/discussions from the symposium on Linkages between spatial ecology and sustainable fisheries held at the ICES Annual Science Conference in September 2017.

AB Nanoparticles (NPs) have been widely used in different areas, including consumer products and medicine. In terms of biomedical applications, NPs or NP-based drug formulations have been extensively investigated for cancer diagnostics and therapy in preclinical studies, but the clinical translation rate is low. Therefore, a thorough and comprehensive understanding of the pharmacokinetics of NPs, especially in drug delivery efficiency to the target therapeutic tissue tumor, is important to design more effective nanomedicines and for proper assessment of the safety and risk of NPs. This review article focuses on the pharmacokinetics of both organic and inorganic NPs and their tumor delivery efficiencies, as well as the associated mechanisms involved. We discuss the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) processes following different routes of exposure and the mechanisms involved. Many physicochemical properties and experimental factors, including particle type, size, surface charge, zeta potential, surface coating, protein binding, dose, exposure route, species, cancer type, and tumor size can affect NP pharmacokinetics and tumor delivery efficiency. NPs can be absorbed with varying degrees following different exposure routes and mainly accumulate in liver and spleen, but also distribute to other tissues such as heart, lung, kidney and tumor tissues; and subsequently get metabolized and/or excreted mainly through hepatobiliary and renal elimination. Passive and active targeting strategies are the two major mechanisms of tumor delivery, while active targeting tends to have less toxicity and higher delivery efficiency through direct interaction between ligands and receptors. We also discuss challenges and perspectives remaining in the field of pharmacokinetics and tumor delivery efficiency of NPs.

AB Breeding programs rely on genotype-by-environment interaction (GEI) to recommend cultivars for specific locations. GEI describes how different genotypes perform under varying environmental conditions. Several methods were proposed to assess adaptability and stability across environments. These methods utilize various statistical approaches like parametric and non-parametric regression, multivariate analysis techniques, and even Bayesian frameworks and artificial intelligence. The accessibility of environmental data through platforms like NASA POWER allows breeders to integrate this information into a breeding process. It has been done by using multi-omics integration models that combine data across various biological levels to create accurate predictive models. In the context of phenotypic adaptability and stability analysis, structural equation modeling (SEM) offers an interesting approach to integrating environmental covariates. This work aimed to propose a novel approach that integrates weather information into adaptability and stability analysis, combining SEM with the established Eberhart and Russell model. Additionally, a user-friendly applet, denoted ECERSEM-AdaptStab, was made available to perform the analysis. This approach utilized data from 12 cotton cultivar trials conducted across two growing seasons at 19 sites. This approach successfully integrated environmental covariates into a phenotypic adaptability and stability analysis of cotton cultivars. Specifically, the genotypes TMG 41 WS, IMA CV 690, DP 555 BGRR, BRS 286 and BRS 369 RF were recommended for favorable environments, while the genotypes TMG 43 WS, IMA 5675 B2RF, IMA 08 WS, NUOPAL, DELTA OPAL, BRS 335, and BRS 368 RF are more suitable for unfavorable environments.

AB Purpose: This review describes ecosystem services (ES) obtained from grasslands within the southeastern United States. In addition, future direction and the importance of these ES to sustain productive agroecosystems are described.
   Sources: Results from published studies investigating various ES provided by grasslands within the southeastern United States are summarized in this article.
   Synthesis: Ecosystem services can be classified into 4 categories: provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural. Grasslands in the southeastern United States range from wet prairies in Florida, to transitional grasslands emerging from tallgrass prairie and longleaf pine ecosystems into coastal marshes in Texas. Provisioning ES from grasslands include animal products, timber, fruits, pods, and medicinal products. Supporting and regulating ES include nutrient cycling, biological nitrogen fixation, water catchment and purification, recharge of aquifers, climate regulation, primary productivity, habitat for wildlife and pollinators, and biodiversity. Grasslands are also important for aesthetic and cultural ES, including hunting leases and recreational parks.
   Conclusions and Applications: Grasslands in the southeastern United States have decreased due to urbanization, rising livestock production costs, and decreases in seed resources. Providing ES assessments will be important to assign value to grassland ecosystems, especially to increase adoption of novel management practices that may enhance delivery of ES. Remote sensing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence are promising tools to scale up the measurement of ES at landscape and watershed levels. In the future, ES will likely be a more prominent component of agroecosystems, and payment mechanisms will become more common to compensate landowners for the benefit they provide for the entire society.

TI Use of Natural Language Processing to Extract and Classify Papillary
   Thyroid Cancer Features From Surgical Pathology Reports
SO ENDOCRINE PRACTICE
LA English
DT Article
DE artificial intelligence; Natural Language Processing; thyroid cancer
AB Background: We aim to use Natural Language Processing to automate the extraction and classification of thyroid cancer risk factors from pathology reports. Methods: We analyzed 1410 surgical pathology reports from adult papillary thyroid cancer patients from 2010 to 2019. Structured and nonstructured reports were used to create a consensus-based ground truth dictionary and categorized them into modified recurrence risk levels. Nonstructured reports were narrative, while structured reports followed standardized formats. We developed ThyroPath, a rule-based Natural Language Processing pipeline, to extract and classify thyroid cancer features into risk categories. Training involved 225 reports (150 structured, 75 unstructured), with testing on 170 reports (120 structured, 50 unstructured) for evaluation. The pipeline's performance was assessed using both strict and lenient criteria for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score; a metric that combines precision and recall evaluation. Results: In extraction tasks, ThyroPath achieved overall strict F-1 scores of 93% for structured reports and 90% for unstructured reports, covering 18 thyroid cancer pathology features. In classification tasks, ThyroPath-extracted information demonstrated an overall accuracy of 93% in categorizing reports based on their corresponding guideline-based risk of recurrence: 76.9% for high-risk, 86.8% for intermediate risk, and 100% for both low and very low-risk cases. However, ThyroPath achieved 100% accuracy across all risk categories with human extracted pathology information. Conclusions: ThyroPath shows promise in automating the extraction and risk recurrence classification of thyroid pathology reports at large scale. It offers a solution to laborious manual reviews and advancing virtual registries. However, it requires further validation before implementation. (c) 2024 AACE. Published by Elsevier Inc.

ID PERFORMANCE; QUALITY; MODELS
AB Transformer neural networks (TNNs) have caused a paradigm shift in deep learning domains like natural language processing, gathering immense interest due to their versatility in other fields such as time series forecasting (TSF). Most current TSF applications of TNNs use only historic observations to predict future events, ignoring information available in weather forecasts to inform better predictions, and with little attention given to the interpretability of the model's use of explanatory inputs. This work explores the potential for TNNs to perform TSF across multiple environmental variables (streamflow, stage, water temperature, and salinity) in two ecologically important regions: the Peace River watershed (Florida) and the northern Gulf of Mexico (Louisiana). The TNN was tested and its prediction uncertainty quantified for each response variable from one-to fourteen-day-ahead forecasts using past observations and spatially distributed weather forecasts. A sensitivity analysis (SA) was performed on the trained TNNs' attention weights to identify the relative influence of each input variable on each response variable across prediction windows. Overall model performance ranged from good to very good (0.78 < NSE < 0.99 for all variables and forecast horizons). Through the SA, we found that the TNN was able to learn the physical patterns behind the data, adapt the use of input variables to each forecast, and increasingly use weather forecast information as prediction windows increased. The TNN's excellent performance and flexibility, along with the intuitive interpretability highlighting the logic behind the models' forecasting decision-making process, provide evidence for the applicability of this architecture to other TSF variables and locations.

AB Strawberry is ranked third in the value of production of the crops in Florida, USA. Classifying strawberry maturity and monitoring strawberry growth status in the field is very critical for accurate strawberry yield prediction, efficient strawberry field management, and achieving the highest crop production. The traditional method of distinguishing strawberry maturity is based on either physical appearance or internal chemical substance content. However, the traditional method is time-consuming and costly. In this research, an automatic strawberry maturity classification system was developed for the rapid and accurate classification of different strawberry maturity stages. A state-of-the-art deep learning method, You Only Look Once (YOLOv3), which is good at small object detection, was trained and applied to detect strawberry flowers and strawberry fruit at different maturity stages. Two strawberry image acquisition methods, aerial imaging and near-ground imaging, were compared by using the same deep learning image processing method. As a result, three and seven strawberry maturity stages were classified for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images and near-ground digital camera images, respectively. For UAV images, the highest mean average precision (mAP) of strawberry maturity classification was 0.88 for a test data set at 2 m, and the highest classification average precision (AP) was 0.93 for fully matured fruit. For near-ground digital camera images, the mAP of strawberry maturity classification was 0.89, and the highest classification AP was 0.94 for fully matured fruit as well. The result shows that YOLOv3 is an excellent approach for strawberry maturity classification on both image types.

AB Enzymes, as paramount protein catalysts, occupy a central role in fostering remarkable progress across numerous fields. However, the intricacy of sequence-function relationships continues to obscure our grasp of enzyme behaviors and curtails our capabilities in rational enzyme engineering. Generative artificial intelligence (AI), known for its proficiency in handling intricate data distributions, holds the potential to offer novel perspectives in enzyme research. Generative models could discern elusive patterns within the vast sequence space and uncover new functional enzyme sequences. This review highlights the recent advancements in employing generative AI for enzyme sequence analysis. We delve into the impact of generative AI in predicting mutation effects on enzyme fitness, catalytic activity and stability, rationalizing the laboratory evolution of de novo enzymes, and decoding protein sequence semantics and their application in enzyme engineering. Notably, the prediction of catalytic activity and stability of enzymes using natural protein sequences serves as a vital link, indicating how enzyme catalysis shapes enzyme evolution. Overall, we foresee that the integration of generative AI into enzyme studies will remarkably enhance our knowledge of enzymes and expedite the creation of superior biocatalysts.
   This Review underscores the latest advances in applying generative AI to the analysis of enzyme sequences, which has deepened our insight into enzyme evolution and catalysis, thereby advancing enzyme engineering.

TI Using ChatGPT to predict the future of personalized medicine
SO PHARMACOGENOMICS JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Personalized medicine is a novel frontier in health care that is based on each person's unique genetic makeup. It represents an exciting opportunity to improve the future of individualized health care for all individuals. Pharmacogenomics, as the main part of personalized medicine, aims to optimize and create a more targeted treatment approach based on genetic variations in drug response. It is predicted that future treatments will be algorithm-based instead of evidence-based that will consider a patient's genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, epigenetic, and lifestyle factors resulting in individualized medication. A generative pretrained transformer (GPT) is an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that generates language resembling human-like writing enabling users to engage in a manner that is practically identical to speaking with a human being. GPT's predictive algorithms can respond to questions that have never been addressed. Chat Generative Pretrained Transformer (ChatGPT) is an AI chatbot's advanced with conversational capabilities. In the present study, questions were asked from ChatGPT about the future of personalized medicine and pharmacogenomics. ChatGPT predicted both to be a promising approach with a bright future that holds great promises in improving patient outcomes and transforming the field of medicine. But it still has several limitations that need to be solved.

AB Introduction: With global adoption of computed tomography (CT) lung cancer screening, there is increasing interest to use artificial intelligence (AI) deep learning methods to improve the clinical management process. To enable AI research using an open -source, cloud -based, globally distributed, screening CT imaging data set and computational environment that are compliant with the most stringent international privacy regulations that also protect the intellectual properties of researchers, the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer sponsored development of the Early Lung Imaging Confederation (ELIC) resource in 2018. The objective of this report is to describe the updated capabilities of ELIC and illustrate how this resource can be used for clinically relevant AI research. Methods: In this second phase of the initiative, metadata and screening CT scans from two time points were collected from 100 screening participants in seven countries. An automated deep learning AI lung segmentation algorithm, automated quantitative emphysema metrics, and a quantitative lung nodule volume measurement algorithm were run on these scans. Results: A total of 1394 CTs were collected from 697 participants. The LAV950 quantitative emphysema metric was found to be potentially useful in distinguishing lung cancer from benign cases using a combined slice thickness more than or equal to 2.5 mm. Lung nodule volume change measurements had better sensitivity and specificity for classifying malignant from benign lung nodules when applied to solid lung nodules from high -quality CT scans. Conclusions: These initial experiments revealed that ELIC can support deep learning AI and quantitative imaging analyses on diverse and globally distributed cloud -based data sets.

   Smart agriculture
ID BIAS
AB Population growth, rapid urbanization, epidemics, political instability, and resource constraints are contributing to disruptions in food supplies, while farm labor shortages, increasing input costs, disease and pest pressure, and federal regulations further reduce food security. The convergence of recent scientific (e.g., genomics) and engineering (e.g., smart sensors, robotics, artificial intelligence) technologies in agriculture have the potential to create more efficient, productive, sustainable, and resilient food systems. Yet, this fusion of agricultural practices with modern, information -based technologies requires a trained workforce that includes engineers, scientists, and production personnel to develop and apply solutions to address critical challenges in agriculture and natural resources. In response to these needs and discussions amongst experts in the field, faculty in the Agricultural and Biological Engineering (ABE) Department at the University of Florida developed two graduate certificates to provide specialized training for students interested in technical careers in agriculture. The ABE faculty have expertise in the application of innovative technology in agricultural and food systems and are uniquely positioned to develop curricula for broader audiences in engineering and agricultural sciences. These smart agriculture (SmartAg) certificates provide students with a curated sequence of required courses in addition to elective courses in an area of their interest. Students in the Engineered SmartAg Certificate (Eng_SmartAg) design, integrate, and implement hardware and software solutions, while science students in the Applied Methods for SmartAg Systems (App_SmartAg), including operators, managers, and technologists, apply solutions from existing systems and components. This article presents the curriculum and certificate development processes in different stages. We start with motivations, program needs, and highlight key discussions amongst experts in the agricultural engineering field that led to the conceptualization of the certificates. Next, we discuss two new integral courses that were developed for each certificate and describe course objectives, curriculum maps, projects, and key assessments. We then describe the process for certificate program assessment, detailing their program missions, alignment, goals, and student learning outcomes, as well as assessment plans and approaches to course evaluation and program improvement. We summarize feedback provided by students enrolled in the first cohorts of these courses and discuss changes and revisions to facilitate student learning opportunities, improve instructional effectiveness, and strengthen the courses and certificates. Finally, we discuss the early challenges in launching both certificates and future plans to market, advertise, and attract students and professionals from different engineering disciplines and agricultural backgrounds interested in agriculture and food system innovations.

ID ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; EUROPEAN EXAM; CHATGPT
AB The GPT-4 large language model (LLM) and ChatGPT chatbot have emerged as accessible and capable tools for generating English-language text in a variety of formats. GPT-4 has previously performed well when applied to questions from multiple standardized examinations. However, further evaluation of trustworthiness and accuracy of GPT-4 responses across various knowledge domains is essential before its use as a reference resource. Here, we assess GPT-4 performance on nine graduate-level examinations in the biomedical sciences (seven blinded), finding that GPT-4 scores exceed the student average in seven of nine cases and exceed all student scores for four exams. GPT-4 performed very well on fill-in-the-blank, short-answer, and essay questions, and correctly answered several questions on figures sourced from published manuscripts. Conversely, GPT-4 performed poorly on questions with figures containing simulated data and those requiring a hand-drawn answer. Two GPT-4 answer-sets were flagged as plagiarism based on answer similarity and some model responses included detailed hallucinations. In addition to assessing GPT-4 performance, we discuss patterns and limitations in GPT-4 capabilities with the goal of informing design of future academic examinations in the chatbot era.

AB Human pathophysiology is occasionally too complex for unaided hypothetical-deductive reasoning and the isolated application of additive or linear statistical methods. Clustering algorithms use input data patterns and distributions to form groups of similar patients or diseases that share distinct properties. Although clinicians frequently perform tasks that may be enhanced by clustering, few receive formal training and clinician-centered literature in clustering is sparse. To add value to clinical care and research, optimal clustering practices require a thorough understanding of how to process and optimize data, select features, weigh strengths and weaknesses of different clustering methods, select the optimal clustering method, and apply clustering methods to solve problems. These concepts and our suggestions for implementing them are described in this narrative review of published literature. All clustering methods share the weakness of finding potential clusters even when natural clusters do not exist, underscoring the importance of applying data-driven techniques as well as clinical and statistical expertise to clustering analyses. When applied properly, patient and disease phenotype clustering can reveal obscured associations that can help clinicians understand disease pathophysiology, predict treatment response, and identify patients for clinical trial enrollment.

AB Precision herbicide application can substantially reduce herbicide input and weed control cost in turfgrass management systems. Intelligent spot-spraying system predominantly relies on machine vision-based detectors for autonomous weed control. In this work, several deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) were constructed for detection of dandelion (Taraxacum officinale Web.), ground ivy (Glechoma hederacea L.), and spotted spurge (Euphorbia maculata L.) growing in perennial ryegrass. When the networks were trained using a dataset containing a total of 15,486 negative (images contained perennial ryegrass with no target weeds) and 17,600 positive images (images contained target weeds), VGGNet achieved high F-1 scores (>= 0.9278), with high recall values (>= 0.9952) for detection of E. maculata, G. hederacea, and T. officinale growing in perennial ryegrass. The F-1 scores of AlexNet ranged from 0.8437 to 0.9418 and were generally lower than VGGNet at detecting E. maculata, G. hederacea, and T. officinale. GoogleNet is not an effective DCNN at detecting these weed species mainly due to the low precision values. DetectNet is an effective DCNN and achieved high F-1 scores (>= 0.9843) in the testing datasets for detection of T. officinale growing in perennial ryegrass. Moreover, VGGNet had the highest Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) values, while GoogleNet had the lowest MCC values. Overall, the approach of training DCNN, particularly VGGNet and DetectNet, presents a clear path toward developing a machine vision-based decision system in smart sprayers for precision weed control in perennial ryegrass.

AB Implementing accelerometer technologies in beef operations is an alternative to increase precision in estrous detection. We hypothesized that (1) the accelerometer algorithm has similar accuracy in detecting behavioral estrus as does visual observation of pressure-sensitive sensors (estrus patches) in grazing beef cows; (2) variables measured by the accelerometer, such as estrus intensity, are associated with hormonal, ovarian, and uterine variables monitored before, during, and after estrus; and (3) the accelerometer variables are associated with the probability of pregnancy in grazing beef cows submitted to embryo transfer (ET). Fifty cows were fitted with accelerometer and patches to detect estrus after a synchronization protocol in eight subsequent rounds. For each round, only cows that showed estrus (day 0; D0) received ET. Follicular diameter, endometrial thickness, corpus luteum (CL) area, and estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) concentrations were measured during proestrus, estrus, and early diestrus. On D7, ET was performed. Pregnancies were diagnosed on D46 and cows recovered for 35D before a new replicate. Patches had a greater accuracy (98 % vs. 91 %) of detection of behavioral estrus than accelerometer algorithm. Cows with lower estrus intensity in the accelerometer had greater follicular diameter on D0 (P = 0.022), CL area on D4 and D7 (P = 0.05), endometrial thickness on D-1 (P = 0.10), and reduced E2 concentrations on D-1 (P = 0.0032). The accelerometer variables did not predict accurately the probability of pregnancy/ET. In conclusion, visual observation of patches was more accurate in detecting estrus than the accelerometer algorithm and most of the associations between accelerometers and physiological variables were for characteristics measured at proestrus.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) applications continue to improve decision-making processes at all levels of education. A relatively untouched area in which AI can be quite useful is automating assessment-related decisions about students' learning outcomes when monitoring students' learning progress through computerized formative assessments. While the use of computerized formative assessments in the classroom allows teachers to assess students' learning continuously and more frequently, there are implementation-related barriers that prevent teachers from maximizing the diagnostic value of such assessments. For example, the administration frequency and scheduling of computerized formative assessments are highly critical for students regardless of their performance level. Traditionally, most teachers have to rely on their judgment and observations in determining the testing schedule for all students. Human judgments, however, might be highly subjective given that teachers are not likely to oversee each student's academic history closely. In this study, we aim to introduce a deep learning framework to predict and optimize the number of test administrations and support the decisions using clustering approaches. We used math performance data gathered from 10,107 first graders during the 2017-2018 school year. Our best model demonstrated highly accurate prediction results with average accuracy scores close to 90%. In addition, the clustering approach revealed interpretable insights into how the test administration decisions were associated with students' performance profiles. The proposed system would greatly help teachers make more systematic and informed test administration decisions and thereby maximize the effectiveness of computerized formative assessments in promoting student learning.

AB Objective:We test the hypothesis that for low-acuity surgical patients, postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) admission is associated with lower value of care compared with ward admission. Background:Overtriaging low-acuity patients to ICU consumes valuable resources and may not confer better patient outcomes. Associations among postoperative overtriage, patient outcomes, costs, and value of care have not been previously reported. Methods:In this longitudinal cohort study, postoperative ICU admissions were classified as overtriaged or appropriately triaged according to machine learning-based patient acuity assessments and requirements for immediate postoperative mechanical ventilation or vasopressor support. The nearest neighbors algorithm identified risk-matched control ward admissions. The primary outcome was value of care, calculated as inverse observed-to-expected mortality ratios divided by total costs. Results:Acuity assessments had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.92 in generating predictions for triage classifications. Of 8592 postoperative ICU admissions, 423 (4.9%) were overtriaged. These were matched with 2155 control ward admissions with similar comorbidities, incidence of emergent surgery, immediate postoperative vital signs, and do not resuscitate order placement and rescindment patterns. Compared with controls, overtraiged admissions did not have a lower incidence of any measured complications. Total costs for admission were $16.4K for overtriage and $15.9K for controls (P=0.03). Value of care was lower for overtriaged admissions [2.9 (2.0-4.0)] compared with controls [24.2 (14.1-34.5), PConclusions:Low-acuity postoperative patients who were overtriaged to ICUs had increased total costs, no improvements in outcomes, and received low-value care.

AB In this study, we conducted a citation network analysis of the Journal of Counseling Psychology (JCP) to elucidate the scope, evolution, and interconnections of JCP publications as reflected in how authors use (i.e., cite) these publications. We used CitNetExplorer to analyze a network of 4,718 JCP publications and 16,959 citation links. The analysis yielded 19 clusters in JCP's citation network. The most dominant facet of the citation network focused on counseling, counseling process, and counseling outcome. The clusters in this facet shifted from an early focus on perceptions of counselors to continuing examinations of what happens in counseling. Another dominant facet comprised clusters on vocational psychology, shifting from an earlier focus on vocational choice and interest, to career counseling and decision making, to vocational and academic development processes and predictors. These major facets converged toward a continuing cluster focused on methodology and analysis along with race, gender, sexuality, and other diversity scholarship. This suggests that diversity-focused publications in JCP often employ and cite methodological and analytic advances. The results also reveal discontinued areas of scholarship in JCP that are ripe for revisiting and rebuilding in new directions (e.g., anger and social justice activism; clinical judgment and artificial intelligence). The results suggest that a promising next step in the evolution of JCP would be for authors to engage with and cite diversity scholarship as central to "general" domains of JCP scholarship.

AB Early and accurate detection of cervical lymph nodes is essential for the optimal management and staging of patients with head and neck malignancies. Pilot studies have demonstrated the potential for radiomic and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches in increasing diagnostic accuracy for the detection and classification of lymph nodes, but implementation of many of these approaches in real-world clinical settings would necessitate an automated lymph node segmentation pipeline as a first step. In this study, we aim to develop a non-invasive deep learning (DL) algorithm for detecting and automatically segmenting cervical lymph nodes in 25,119 CT slices from 221 normal neck contrast-enhanced CT scans from patients without head and neck cancer. We focused on the most challenging task of segmentation of small lymph nodes, evaluated multiple architectures, and employed U-Net and our adapted spatial context network to detect and segment small lymph nodes measuring 5-10 mm. The developed algorithm achieved a Dice score of 0.8084, indicating its effectiveness in detecting and segmenting cervical lymph nodes despite their small size. A segmentation framework successful in this task could represent an essential initial block for future algorithms aiming to evaluate small objects such as lymph nodes in different body parts, including small lymph nodes looking normal to the naked human eye but harboring early nodal metastases.

AB Although they are staple foods in cuisines globally, many commercial fruit varieties have become progressively less flavorful over time. Due to the cost and difficulty associated with flavor phenotyping, breeding programs have long been challenged in selecting for this complex trait. To address this issue, we leveraged targeted metabolomics of diverse tomato and blueberry accessions and their corresponding consumer panel ratings to create statistical and machine learning models that can predict sensory perceptions of fruit flavor. Using these models, a breeding program can assess flavor ratings for a large number of genotypes, previously limited by the low throughput of consumer sensory panels. The ability to predict consumer ratings of liking, sweet, sour, umami, and flavor intensity was evaluated by a 10-fold cross-validation, and the accuracies of 18 different models were assessed. The prediction accuracies were high for most attributes and ranged from 0.87 for sourness intensity in blueberry using XGBoost to 0.46 for overall liking in tomato using linear regression. Further, the bestperforming models were used to infer the flavor compounds (sugars, acids, and volatiles) that contribute most to each flavor attribute. We found that the variance decomposition of overall liking score estimates that 42% and 56% of the variance was explained by volatile organic compounds in tomato and blueberry, respectively. We expect that these models will enable an earlier incorporation of flavor as breeding targets and encourage selection and release of more flavorful fruit varieties.

AB BACKGROUND:Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) remain a challenging neurological diagnosis associated with significant morbidity and mortality. There is a plethora of microsurgical and endovascular techniques for the treatment of both ruptured and unruptured aneurysms. There is no definitive consensus as to the best treatment option for this cerebrovascular pathology. The Aneurysm, Arteriovenous Malformation, and Chronic Subdural Hematoma Roundtable Discussion With Industry and Stroke Experts discussed best practices and the most promising approaches to improve the management of brain aneurysms.METHODS:A group of experts from academia, industry, and federal regulators convened to discuss updated clinical trials, scientific research on preclinical system models, management options, screening and monitoring, and promising novel device technologies, aiming to improve the outcomes of patients with IA.RESULTS:Aneurysm, Arteriovenous Malformation, and Chronic Subdural Hematoma Roundtable Discussion With Industry and Stroke Experts suggested the incorporation of artificial intelligence to capture sequential aneurysm growth, identify predictors of rupture, and predict the risk of rupture to guide treatment options. The consensus strongly recommended nationwide systemic data collection of unruptured IA radiographic images for the analysis and development of machine learning algorithms for rupture risk. The consensus supported centers of excellence for preclinical multicenter trials in areas such as genetics, cellular composition, and radiogenomics. Optical coherence tomography and magnetic resonance imaging contrast-enhanced 3T vessel wall imaging are promising technologies; however, more data are needed to define their role in IA management. Ruptured aneurysms are best managed at large volume centers, which should include comprehensive patient management with expertise in microsurgery, endovascular surgery, neurology, and neurocritical care.CONCLUSIONS:Clinical and preclinical studies and scientific research on IA should engage high-volume centers and be conducted in multicenter collaborative efforts. The future of IA diagnosis and monitoring could be enhanced by the incorporation of artificial intelligence and national radiographic and biologic registries. A collaborative effort between academic centers, government regulators, and the device industry is paramount for the adequate management of IA and the advancement of the field.

AB Immunosuppression after liver transplantation is essential for preventing allograft rejection. However, long-term drug toxicity and associated complications necessitate investigation of immunosuppression minimization and withdrawal protocols. Development of such protocols is hindered by reliance on current paradigms for monitoring allograft function and rejection status. The current standard of care for diagnosis of rejection is histopathologic assessment and grading of liver biopsies in accordance with the Banff Rejection Activity Index. However, this method is limited by cost, sampling variability, and interobserver variation. Moreover, the invasive nature of biopsy increases the risk of patient complications. Incorporating noninvasive techniques may supplement existing methods through improved understanding of rejection causes, hepatic spatial architecture, and the role of idiopathic fibroinflammatory regions. These techniques may also aid in quantification and help integrate emerging -omics analyses with current assessments. Alternatively, emerging noninvasive methods show potential to detect and distinguish between different types of rejection while minimizing risk of adverse advents. Although biomarkers have yet to replace biopsy, preliminary studies suggest that several classes of analytes may be used to detect rejection with greater sensitivity and in earlier stages than traditional methods, possibly when coupled with artificial intelligence. Here, we provide an overview of the latest efforts in optimizing the diagnosis of rejection in liver transplantation.

AB While museum voucher specimens continue to be the standard for species identifications, biodiversity data are increasingly represented by photographic records from camera traps and amateur naturalists. Some species are easily recognized in these pictures, others are impossible to distinguish. Here we quantify the extent to which 335 terrestrial nonvolant North American mammals can be identified in typical photographs, with and without considering species range maps. We evaluated all pairwise comparisons of species and judged, based on professional opinion, whether they are visually distinguishable in typical pictures from camera traps or the iNaturalist crowdsourced platform on a 4-point scale: (1) always, (2) usually, (3) rarely, or (4) never. Most (96.5%) of the 55,944 pairwise comparisons were ranked as always or usually distinguishable in a photograph, leaving exactly 2,000 pairs of species that can rarely or never be distinguished from typical pictures, primarily within clades such as shrews and small-bodied rodents. Accounting for a species geographic range eliminates many problematic comparisons, such that the average number of difficult or impossible-to-distinguish species pairs from any location was 7.3 when considering all species, or 0.37 when considering only those typically surveyed with camera traps. The greatest diversity of difficult-to-distinguish species was in Arizona and New Mexico, with 57 difficult pairs of species, suggesting the problem scales with overall species diversity. Our results show which species are most readily differentiated by photographic data and which taxa should be identified only to higher taxonomic levels (e.g., genus). Our results are relevant to ecologists, as well as those using artificial intelligence to identify species in photographs, but also serve as a reminder that continued study of mammals through museum vouchers is critical since it is the only way to accurately identify many smaller species, provides a wealth of data unattainable from photographs, and constrains photographic records via accurate range maps. Ongoing specimen voucher collection, in addition to photographs, will become even more important as species ranges change, and photographic evidence alone will not be sufficient to document these dynamics for many species.

AB Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a severe and disabling facial pain condition and is characterized by intermittent, severe, electric shock-like pain in one (or more) trigeminal subdivisions. This pain can be triggered by an innocuous stimulus or can be spontaneous. Presently available therapies for TN include both surgical and pharmacological management; however, the lack of a known etiology for TN contributes to the unpredictable response to treatment and the variability in long-term clinical outcomes. Given this, a range of peripheral and central mechanisms underlying TN pain remain to be understood. We acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from TN patients who (1) rested comfortably in the scanner during a resting state session and (2) rated their pain levels in real time using a calibrated tracking ball-controlled scale in a pain tracking session. Following data acquisition, the data was analyzed using the conventional correlation analysis and two artificial intelligence (AI)-inspired deep learning methods: convolutional neural network (CNN) and graph convolutional neural network (GCNN). Each of the three methods yielded a set of brain regions related to the generation and perception of pain in TN. There were 6 regions that were identified by all three methods, including the superior temporal cortex, the insula, the fusiform, the precentral gyrus, the superior frontal gyrus, and the supramarginal gyrus. Additionally, 17 regions, including dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and the thalamus, were identified by at least two of the three methods. Collectively, these 23 regions are taken to represent signature centers of TN pain and provide target areas for future studies seeking to understand the central mechanisms of TN.

AB This study addresses two critical research gaps in human-robot interaction (HRI): the limited systematic research on the role of trust in customers' acceptance of artificially intelligent (AI) robots; and the lack of understanding of robot acceptance under different cultural backgrounds. Drawing on the AIDUA framework, this study examines the impacts of trust and moderating effects of both national (the U.S. and China) and individual culture on customers' intentions to use AI robots in hospitality services by developing a theoretical model. The model is tested on data collected using online data collection platforms from 491 U.S. and 495 Chinese respondents. PLS-SEM and the bootstrapping method were used to test the hypothesized relationships and analyze the moderating effects of culture, respectively. The findings suggest that trust in interaction with AI robots is a significant higher -order construct that influences the intention of use. Furthermore, uncertainty avoidance, long-term orientation, and power distance have been found to exhibit significant moderation effects. The results of this study extend the theoretical frameworks in HRI and provide detailed guidance to promote AI robot applications across different cultures.

ID SURGICAL RISK CALCULATOR; AMERICAN-COLLEGE; APGAR SCORE
AB IMPORTANCE Predicting postoperative complications has the potential to inform shared decisions regarding the appropriateness of surgical procedures, targeted risk-reduction strategies, and postoperative resource use. Realizing these advantages requires that accurate real-time predictions be integrated with clinical and digital workflows; artificial intelligence predictive analytic platforms using automated electronic health record (EHR) data inputs offer an intriguing possibility for achieving this, but there is a lack of high-level evidence from prospective studies supporting their use.
   OBJECTIVE To examine whether the MySurgeryRisk artificial intelligence system has stable predictive performance between development and prospective validation phases and whether it is feasible to provide automated outputs directly to surgeons' mobile devices.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this prognostic study, the platform used automated EHR data inputs and machine learning algorithms to predict postoperative complications and provide predictions to surgeons, previously through a web portal and currently through a mobile device application. All patients 18 years or older who were admitted for any type of inpatient surgical procedure (74417 total procedures involving 58 236 patients) between June 1, 2014, and September 20, 2020, were included. Models were developed using retrospective data from 52117 inpatient surgical procedures performed between June 1, 2014, and November 27, 2018. Validation was performed using data from 22 30 0 inpatient surgical procedures collected prospectively from November 28, 2018, to September 20, 2020.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Algorithms for generalized additive models and random forest models were developed and validated using real-time EHR data. Model predictive performance was evaluated primarily using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values.
   RESULTS Among 58 236 total adult patients who received 74417 major inpatient surgical procedures, the mean (SD) age was 57 (17) years; 29 226 patients (50.2%) were male. Results reported in this article focus primarily on the validation cohort. The validation cohort included 22 300 inpatient surgical procedures involving 19 132 patients (mean [SD] age, 58 [17] years; 9672 [50.6%] male). A total of 2765 patients (14.5%) were Black or African American, 14 777 (77.2%) were White, 1235 (6.5%) were of other races (including American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, and multiracial), and 355 (1.9%) were of unknown race because of missing data; 979 patients (5.1%) were Hispanic, 17 663 (92.3%) were non-Hispanic, and 490 (2.6%) were of unknown ethnicity because of missing data. A greater number of input features was associated with stable or improved model performance. For example, the random forest model trained with 135 input features had the highest AUROC values for predicting acute kidney injury (0.82; 95% CI, 0.82-0.83); cardiovascular complications (0.81; 95% CI. 0.81-0.82); neurological complications, including delirium (0.87; 95% CI, 0.87-0.88); prolonged intensive care unit stay (0.89; 95% CI, 0.88-0.89); prolonged mechanical ventilation (0.91; 95% CI, 0.90-0.91); sepsis (0.86; 95% CI, 0.85-0.87); venous thromboembolism (0.82; 95% CI, 0.81-0.83); wound complications (0.78; 95% CI, 0.78-0.79); 30-day mortality (0.84; 95% CI, 0.82-0.86); and 90-day mortality (0.84; 95% CI, 0.82-0.85), with accuracy similar to surgeons' predictions. Compared with the original web portal, the mobile device application allowed efficient fingerprint login access and loaded data approximately 10 times faster. The application output displayed patient information, risk of postoperative complications, top 3 risk factors for each complication, and patterns of complications for individual surgeons compared with their colleagues.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, automated real-time predictions of postoperative complications with mobile device outputs had good performance in clinical settings with prospective validation, matching surgeons' predictive accuracy.

   segmentation; Multi-modal MRI
AB The burgeoning field of brain health research increasingly leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze and interpret neuroimaging data. Medical foundation models have shown promise of superior performance with better sample efficiency. This work introduces a novel approach towards creating 3-dimensional (3D) medical foundation models for multimodal neuroimage segmentation through self-supervised training. Our approach involves a novel two-stage pretraining approach using vision transformers. The first stage encodes anatomical structures in generally healthy brains from the large-scale unlabeled neuroimage dataset of multimodal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images from 41,400 participants. This stage of pertaining focuses on identifying key features such as shapes and sizes of different brain structures. The second pretraining stage identifies disease-specific attributes, such as geometric shapes of tumors and lesions and spatial placements within the brain. This dual-phase methodology significantly reduces the extensive data requirements usually necessary for AI model training in neuroimage segmentation with the flexibility to adapt to various imaging modalities. We rigorously evaluate our model, BrainSegFounder, using the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge and Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke v2.0 (ATLAS v2.0) datasets. BrainSegFounder demonstrates a significant performance gain, surpassing the achievements of the previous winning solutions using fully supervised learning. Our findings underscore the impact of scaling up both the model complexity and the volume of unlabeled training data derived from generally healthy brains. Both of these factors enhance the accuracy and predictive capabilities of the model in neuroimage segmentation tasks. Our pretrained models and code are at https://github.com/lab-smile/BrainSegFounder.

AB Objectives To evaluate and compare the performance of ChatGPT (TM) (Open AI (R)) and Bing AI (TM) (Microsoft (R)) for responding to kidney stone treatment-related questions in accordance with the American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines and assess factors such as appropriateness, emphasis on consulting healthcare providers, references, and adherence to guidelines by each chatbot. Methods We developed 20 kidney stone evaluation and treatment-related questions based on the AUA Surgical Management of Stones guideline. Questions were asked to ChatGPT and Bing AI chatbots. We compared their responses utilizing the brief DISCERN tool as well as response appropriateness. Results ChatGPT significantly outperformed Bing AI for questions 1-3, which evaluate clarity, achievement, and relevance of responses (12.77 +/- 1.71 vs. 10.17 +/- 3.27; p < 0.01). In contrast, Bing AI always incorporated references, whereas ChatGPT never did. Consequently, the results for questions 4-6, which evaluated the quality of sources, were consistently favored Bing AI over ChatGPT (10.8 vs. 4.28; p < 0.01). Notably, neither chatbot offered guidance against guidelines for pre-operative testing. However, recommendations against guidelines were notable for specific scenarios: 30.5% for the treatment of adults with ureteral stones, 52.5% for adults with renal stones, and 20.5% for all patient treatment. Conclusions ChatGPT significantly outperformed Bing AI in terms of providing responses with clear aim, achieving such aim, and relevant and appropriate responses based on AUA surgical stone management guidelines. However, Bing AI provides references, allowing information quality assessment. Additional studies are needed to further evaluate these chatbots and their potential use by clinicians and patients for urologic healthcare-related questions.

ID WORKSHOPS; DESIGN
AB The architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) education communities are increasingly facing challenges caused by social, technological, economic, environmental, and political changes. Addressing these issues requires AEC educators and practitioners to systematically rethink and reform many of their current practices. Anecdotal evidence in AEC education already exists with respect to pedagogical improvements made by individual technologies such as immersive computing, artificial intelligence, robotics, big data, cyberinfrastructure, and photogrammetry. However, an effective learning-centered environment is more complex than what any single technology can accomplish. In addition, the relationship between technology-intensive learning and digital inequity in AEC education remains, to the most extent, unclear. We envision the next-generation learning-centered environment for AEC education to be technology-intensive, interdisciplinary, industry-linked, and equitable. This paper aims to present a shared vision of the next-generation learning-centered environment for AEC education. To achieve this goal, two interrelated workshops were organized with the participation of different stakeholders, including researchers, educators, and professionals from multiple disciplines of architecture, engineering, construction, computer science, learning science, education, and social sciences. This paper is based on the combined outcomes of the two workshops, organized in four themes: (1) AEC curricula and industry practice, (2) technology and learning, (3) interdisciplinary education, and (4) digital inequity. This paper contributes to the body of knowledge by creating a pathway to timely reflect on new learning strategies, new technologies, and future industry and societal needs in AEC curricula, thus producing a more adaptive AEC workforce for the 21st century. The findings of this work can be adopted by educators to develop a roadmap for creating the shared vision of the next-generation learning-centered environment for AEC education.

TI Evaluation of a machine learning tool to screen for hypoadrenocorticism
   in dogs presenting to a teaching hospital
SO JOURNAL OF VETERINARY INTERNAL MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
DE ACTH; Addison's disease; artificial intelligence; cortisol
AB Background: Dogs with hypoadrenocorticism (HA) have clinical signs and clinicopathologic abnormalities that can be mistaken as other diseases. In dogs with a differential diagnosis of HA, a machine learning model (MLM) has been validated to discriminate between HA and other diseases. This MLM has not been evaluated as a screening tool for a broader group of dogs.
   Hypothesis: An MLM can accurately screen dogs for HA.
   Animals: Dogs (n = 1025) examined at a veterinary hospital.
   Methods: Dogs that presented to a tertiary referral hospital that had a CBC and serum chemistry panel were enrolled. A trained MLM was applied to clinicopathologic data and in dogs that were MLM positive for HA, diagnosis was confirmed by measurement of serum cortisol.
   Results: Twelve dogs were MLM positive for HA and had further cortisol testing. Five had HA confirmed (true positive), 4 of which were treated for mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid deficiency, and 1 was treated for glucocorticoid deficiency alone. Three MLM positive dogs had baseline cortisol >= 2 mu g/dL but were euthanized or administered glucocorticoid treatment without confirming the diagnosis with an ACTH-stimulation test (classified as "undetermined"), and in 4, HA was ruled out (false positives). The positive likelihood ratio of the MLM was 145 to 254. All dogs diagnosed with HA by attending clinicians tested positive by the MLM.
   Conclusions and Clinical Importance: This MLM can robustly predict HA status when indiscriminately screening all dogs with blood work. In this group of dogs with a low prevalence of HA, the false positive rates were clinically acceptable.

TI SiGra: single-cell spatial elucidation through an image-augmented graph

SO NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
ID MOUSE; EXPRESSION
AB Recent advances in high-throughput molecular imaging have pushed spatial transcriptomics technologies to subcellular resolution, which surpasses the limitations of both single-cell RNA-seq and array-based spatial profiling. The multichannel immunohistochemistry images in such data provide rich information on the cell types, functions, and morphologies of cellular compartments. In this work, we developed a method, single-cell spatial elucidation through image-augmented Graph transformer (SiGra), to leverage such imaging information for revealing spatial domains and enhancing substantially sparse and noisy transcriptomics data. SiGra applies hybrid graph transformers over a single-cell spatial graph. SiGra outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both single-cell and spot-level spatial transcriptomics data from complex tissues. The inclusion of immunohistochemistry images improves the model performance by 37% (95% CI: 27-50%). SiGra improves the characterization of intratumor heterogeneity and intercellular communication and recovers the known microscopic anatomy. Overall, SiGra effectively integrates different spatial modality data to gain deep insights into spatial cellular ecosystems.
   Recent advances have pushed spatial transcriptomics to subcellular resolution. Here, the authors propose SiGra, a graph artificial intelligence model designed for high-throughput spatial molecular imaging.

AB Background The algorithmic patient preference predictor (PPP) has been proposed to aid in decision making for incapacitated patients in the absence of advanced directives. Ethical and legal challenges aside, multiple practical barriers exist for building a personalized PPP. Here, we examine previous work using machine learning to predict patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) for capacitated patients undergoing diverse procedures, therapies, and life events. Demonstrating robust performance in predicting PROMs for capacitated patients could suggest opportunities for developing a model tailored to incapacitated ones.Methods We performed a scoping review of PubMed, Embase, and Scopus using the PRISMA-ScR guidelines to capture studies using machine learning to predict PROMs following a medical event alongside qualitative studies exploring a theoretical PPP.Results Sixty-eight studies used machine learning to evaluate PROMs; an additional 20 studies focused on a theoretical PPP. For PROMs, orthopedic surgeries (n = 33) and spinal surgeries (n = 12) were the most common medical event. Studies used demographic (n = 30), pre-event PROMs (n = 52), comorbidities (n = 29), social determinants of health (n = 30), and intraoperative variables (n = 124) as predictors. Thirty-four different PROMs were used as the target outcome. Evaluation metrics varied by task, but performance was overall poor to moderate for the best reported scores. In models that used feature importance, pre-event PROMs were the most predictive of post-event PROMs. Fairness assessments were rare (n = 6). These findings reinforce the necessity of the integrating patient values and preferences, beyond demographic factors, to improve the development of personalized PPP models for incapacitated patients.Conclusion The primary objective of a PPP is to estimate patient-reported quality of life following an intervention. Use of machine learning to predict PROMs for capacitated patients introduces challenges and opportunities for building a personalized PPP for incapacitated patients without advanced directives.

AB Tuberculosis (TB) elimination requires innovative approaches. The new Global Tuberculosis Network (GTN) aims to conduct research on key unmet therapeutic and diagnostic needs in the field of TB elimination using multidisciplinary, multisectorial approaches. The TB Pharmacology section within the new GTN aims to detect and study the current knowledge gaps, test potential solutions using human pharmacokinetics informed through preclinical infection systems, and return those findings to the bedside. Moreover, this approach would allow prospective identification and validation of optimal shorter therapeutic durations with new regimens. Optimized treatment using available and repurposed drugs may have an increased impact when prioritizing a person-centered approach and acknowledge the importance of age, gender, comorbidities, and both social and programmatic environments. In this viewpoint article, we present an in-depth discussion on how TB pharmacology and the related strategies will contribute to TB elimination.

ID GENERATION; PREDICTION; KNOWLEDGE
AB Although substantial efforts have been made using graph neural networks (GNNs) for artificial intelligence (AI)-driven drug discovery, effective molecular representation learning remains an open challenge, especially in the case of insufficient labeled molecules. Recent studies suggest that big GNN models pre-trained by self-supervised learning on unlabeled datasets enable better transfer performance in downstream molecular property prediction tasks. However, the approaches in these studies require multiple complex self-supervised tasks and large-scale datasets , which are time-consuming, computationally expensive and difficult to pre-train end-to-end. Here, we design a simple yet effective self-supervised strategy to simultaneously learn local and global information about molecules, and further propose a novel bi-branch masked graph transformer autoencoder (BatmanNet) to learn molecular representations. BatmanNet features two tailored complementary and asymmetric graph autoencoders to reconstruct the missing nodes and edges, respectively, from a masked molecular graph. With this design, BatmanNet can effectively capture the underlying structure and semantic information of molecules, thus improving the performance of molecular representation. BatmanNet achieves state-of-the-art results for multiple drug discovery tasks, including molecular properties prediction, drug-drug interaction and drug-target interaction, on 13 benchmark datasets, demonstrating its great potential and superiority in molecular representation learning.

AB The human brain is arguably the most complex "machine" to ever exist. Its detailed functioning is yet to be fully understood, let alone modelled. Neurological processes have logical signal-processing and biophysical aspects, and both affect the brain's structure, functioning and adaptation. Mathematical approaches based on both information and graph theory have been extensively used in an attempt to approximate its biological functioning, along with Artificial Intelligence frameworks inspired by its logical functioning. In this article, an approach to model some aspects of the brain learning and signal processing is presented, mimicking the metastability and backpropagation found in the real brain while also accounting for neuroplasticity. Several simulations are carried out with this model to demonstrate how dynamic neuroplasticity, neural inhibition and neuron migration can reshape the brain's logical connectivity to synchronise signal processing and obtain certain target latencies. This work showcases the importance of dynamic logical and biophysical remodelling in brain plasticity. Combining mathematical (agents, graph theory, topology and backpropagation) and biomedical ingredients (metastability, neuroplasticity and migration), these preliminary results prove complex brain phenomena can be reproduced-under pertinent simplifications-via affordable computations, which can be construed as a starting point for more ambitiously accurate simulations.

AB Canine hypoadrenocorticism (CHA) is a life-threatening condition that affects approximately 3 of 1,000 dogs. It has a wide array of clinical signs and is known to mimic other disease processes, including kidney and gastrointestinal diseases, creating a diagnostic challenge. Because CHA can be fatal if not appropriately treated, there is risk to the patient if the condition is not diagnosed. However, the prognosis is excellent with appropriate therapy. A major hurdle to diagnosing CHA is the lack of awareness and low index of suspicion. Once suspected, the application and interpretation of conclusive diagnostic tests is relatively straight forward. In this study, machine learning methods were employed to aid in the diagnosis of CHA using routinely collected screening diagnostics (complete blood count and serum chemistry panel). These data were collected for 908 control dogs (suspected to have CHA, but disease ruled out) and 133 dogs with confirmed CHA. A boosted tree algorithm (AdaBoost) was trained with 80% of the collected data, and 20% was then utilized as test data to assess performance. Algorithm learning was demonstrated as the training set was increased from 0 to 600 dogs. The developed algorithm model has a sensitivity of 96.3% (95% CI, 81.7%-99.8%), specificity of 97.2% (95% CI, 93.7%-98.8%), and an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.994 (95% CI, 0.984-0.999), and it outperforms other screening methods including logistic regression analysis. An easy-to-use graphical interface allows the practitioner to easily implement this technology to screen for CHA leading to improved outcomes for patients and owners. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB Changes in morpho-physiological traits are important for biotic or abiotic stresses in sugarcane (Saccharum spp. interspecific hybrids). Ground measurements of such traits are labor-intensive and time-consuming. Therefore, predicting them using aerial imagery can be important for detecting stress and timely management. In this study, ground data and aerial imagery were collected from plant cane and first ratoon (two site-years) field trials of the last stage (Stage IV) of the Canal Point sugarcane cultivar development program in Florida. There were multiple genotypes (12 plant cane: 9 first ratoon) with six replications in each trial. Data were collected on soil plant analysis development (SPAD), leaf area index (LAI), plant height, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and number of millable stalks per hectare. Aerial imageries were collected using a hyperspectral sensor, and ground data using handheld sensors and manual readings on multiple dates (April, July, and September) to determine the best timing in morpho-physiological trait prediction. The gradient boosting regression tree was selected as the best prediction model. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was utilized to determine the model's prediction accuracy. Results showed that SPAD was predicted with higher accuracy (89%) compared to other traits. July was observed as the best time for predicting most of the morpho-physiological traits in plant cane and first ratoon. Furthermore, the NDVI values collected by GreenSeeker and UAV imaging were compared using the Bland-Altman degree of agreement, and it was found that the mean difference of NDVI values between the two sensing systems was low (0.09).

AB The Short-Term Load Forecasting (STLF) is a pre-eminent task for reliable power generation and electrical load dispatching in the power system. Numerous machine-learning and deep-learning forecasting algorithms have been presented in literature for performing an accurate electrical load forecast. However, the complicated structure of machine-learning and deep-learning multi-layer and with increased filter size architectures provoke the overfitting issue, which degrades the performance of STLF engines in the presence of highly diversified weather and temporal variations. This paper proposes a novel two-stage Encoder-Decoder (ED) network with improved generalization capability and forecasting accuracy. The proposed architecture is based on Short Receptive field based Dilated Causal Convolutional (SRDCC) network in the first stage and Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network in the second stage. Using real valued data, the proposed ED architecture is quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed in comparison with state-of-the-art machine-learning and hybrid deep-learning STLF models. The evaluation matrix used for the comparison consists of six evaluation parameters. The extensive experimentation for multi-step ahead STLF validates the efficiency of the proposed technique in terms of accuracy in comparison with other employed models. The CNN-LSTM revealed to have best performance among all other implemented parametric and non-parametric forecasting models; however, the proposed ED architecture proves to be 35% more accurate compared to CNN-LSTM and have the tendency to capture the local trends in an electrical load pattern more accurately. Moreover, a detailed comparative analysis on the computational complexity of the proposed ED architecture is also conducted to show the real implementation prospect.

AB Precision agriculture involves applying artificial intelligence, computers, sensors, and automation to improve crop field productivity while monitoring environmental conditions to conserve soil, water, and other natural resources focusing on agricultural sustainability. Despite many applications in agriculture, data monitoring and recording technologies have limited use due to the price. Low-cost open-source systems, like the ones available with the Internet of things (IoT) world, can potentially be developed as a universal-fit and cloud-connected technology for multiple applications. We designed and built a basic data collecting system using a commercial standalone embedded computer with Python programming language, serial data interface (SDI)-12/analog sensor adaptor, and digital sensors to monitor soil moisture and transmit the data remotely. SDI-12 is a standard communication protocol that transfers digital sensor measurements to a data recorder. We set up a pilot study that automatically collected and uploaded the data into the Internet to allow remote data transfer and access. The system performed reliably over 1 week with potting soil under field conditions without maintenance and successfully recorded data in real-time. The volumetric water content ranged from 0.03 to 0.23 m(3).m(-3), dielectric permittivity from 3.3 to 18.9 (unitless), EC from 0.0 to 0.3 dS.m(-1), and soil temperature from 20.7 to 44.8 degrees C. All the data were successfully collected and uploaded to the cloud every 20 min, allowing users to remotely monitor the data using a free online application. However, heavy rainfall and high insolation could damage the system through excessive moisture or overheating, requiring a waterproof and heavy-duty protection case. The ThingSpeak channel allows customizing to suit a user's specific requirements or adding more features for further development, such as automated irrigation, which can improve irrigation and fertilization efficiency by applying water and fertilizers at the right time based on sensor readings.

AB Objectives: To compare detection patterns of 80 cephalometric landmarks identified by an automated identification system (AI) based on a recently proposed deep-learning method, the You-Only-Look-Once version 3 (YOLOv3), with those identified by human examiners.
   Materials and Methods: The YOLOv3 algorithm was implemented with custom modifications and trained on 1028 cephalograms. A total of 80 landmarks comprising two vertical reference points and 46 hard tissue and 32 soft tissue landmarks were identified. On the 283 test images, the same 80 landmarks were identified by AI and human examiners twice. Statistical analyses were conducted to detect whether any significant differences between AI and human examiners existed. Influence of image factors on those differences was also investigated.
   Results: Upon repeated trials, AI always detected identical positions on each landmark, while the human intraexaminer variability of repeated manual detections demonstrated a detection error of 0.97 +/- 1.03 mm. The mean detection error between AI and human was 1.46 +/- 2.97 mm. The mean difference between human examiners was 1.50 +/- 1.48 mm. In general, comparisons in the detection errors between AI and human examiners were less than 0.9 mm, which did not seem to be clinically significant.
   Conclusions: AI showed as accurate an identification of cephalometric landmarks as did human examiners. AI might be a viable option for repeatedly identifying multiple cephalometric landmarks.

AB Objective: To compare the accuracy and computational efficiency of two of the latest deep-learning algorithms for automatic identification of cephalometric landmarks.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 1028 cephalometric radiographic images were selected as learning data that trained You-Only-Look-Once version 3 (YOLOv3) and Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) methods. The number of target labeling was 80 landmarks. After the deep-learning process, the algorithms were tested using a new test data set composed of 283 images. Accuracy was determined by measuring the point-to-point error and success detection rate and was visualized by drawing scattergrams. The computational time of both algorithms was also recorded.
   Results: The YOLOv3 algorithm outperformed SSD in accuracy for 38 of 80 landmarks. The other 42 of 80 landmarks did not show a statistically significant difference between YOLOv3 and SSD. Error plots of YOLOv3 showed not only a smaller error range but also a more isotropic tendency. The mean computational time spent per image was 0.05 seconds and 2.89 seconds for YOLOv3 and SSD, respectively. YOLOv3 showed approximately 5% higher accuracy compared with the top benchmarks in the literature.
   Conclusions: Between the two latest deep-learning methods applied, YOLOv3 seemed to be more promising as a fully automated cephalometric landmark identification system for use in clinical practice.

AB Contemporary agricultural systems are poised to transition from linear to circular, adopting concepts of recycling, repurposing, and regeneration. This transition will require changing crop improvement objectives to consider the entire system, and thus provide solutions to improve complex systems for higher productivity, resource use efficiency, and environmental quality. The methods and approaches that underpinned the doubling of yields during the last century may no longer be fully adequate to target crop improvement for circular agricultural systems. Here we propose a multidimensional framework for prediction with outcomes useful to assess both crop performance traits and environmental sustainability of the designed agricultural systems. The study focuses on maize harvestable grain yield and total carbon production, water use, and use efficiency for yield and carbon. The framework builds on the crop growth model whole genome prediction system, which is enabled by advanced phenomics and the integration of symbolic and sub-symbolic artificial intelligence. We demonstrate the approach and prediction accuracy advantages over a standard statistical genomic prediction approach used to breed maize hybrids for yield, flowering time, and kernel set using a dataset comprised of 7004 hybrids, 103 breeding populations, and 62 environments resulting from six years of experimentation in maize drought breeding in the U.S. We propose this framework to motivate a dialogue for how to enable circularity in agriculture through prediction-based systems design.

AB Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models trained on natural protein sequences have been used to design functional enzymes. However, their ability to predict individual reaction steps in enzyme catalysis remains unclear, limiting the potential use of sequence information for enzyme engineering. In this study, we demonstrated that sequence information can predict the rate of the SN2 step of a haloalkane dehalogenase using a generative maximum-entropy (MaxEnt) model. We then designed lower-order protein variants of haloalkane dehalogenase using the model. Kinetic measurements confirmed the successful design of protein variants that enhance catalytic activity, above that of the wild type, in the overall reaction and in particular in the SN2 step. On the simulation side, we provided molecular insights into these designs for the SN2 step using the empirical valence bond (EVB) and metadynamics simulations. The EVB calculations showed activation barriers consistent with experimental reaction rates, while examining the effect of amino acid replacements on the electrostatic effect on the activation barrier and the consequence of water penetration, as well as the extent of ground state destabilization/stabilization. Metadynamics simulations emphasize the importance of the substrate positioning in enzyme catalysis. Overall, our AI-guided approach successfully enabled the design of a variant with a faster rate for the SN2 step than the wild-type enzyme, despite haloalkane dehalogenase being extensively optimized through natural evolution.

AB Surgeons perform two primary tasks: operating and engaging patients and caregivers in shared decision-making. Human dexterity and decision-making are biologically limited. Intelligent, autonomous machines have the potential to augment or replace surgeons. Rather than regarding this possibility with denial, ire, or indifference, surgeons should understand and steer these technologies. Closer examination of surgical innovations and lessons learned from the automotive industry can inform this process. Innovations in minimally invasive surgery and surgical decision-making follow classic S-shaped curves with three phases: (1) introduction of a new technology, (2) achievement of a performance advantage relative to existing standards, and (3) arrival at a performance plateau, followed by replacement with an innovation featuring greater machine autonomy and less human influence. There is currently no level I evidence demonstrating improved patient outcomes using intelligent, autonomous machines for performing operations or surgical decision-making tasks. History suggests that if such evidence emerges and if the machines are cost effective, then they will augment or replace humans, initially for simple, common, rote tasks under close human supervision and later for complex tasks with minimal human supervision. This process poses ethical challenges in assigning liability for errors, matching decisions to patient values, and displacing human workers, but may allow surgeons to spend less time gathering and analyzing data and more time interacting with patients and tending to urgent, critical-and potentially more valuable-aspects of patient care. Surgeons should steer these technologies toward optimal patient care and net social benefit using the uniquely human traits of creativity, altruism, and moral deliberation. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB Objectives: To determine if an automated superimposition method using six landmarks (Sella, Nasion, Porion, Orbitale, Basion, and Pterygoid) would be more suitable than the traditional SellaNasion (SN) method to evaluate growth changes. Materials and Methods: Serial lateral cephalograms at an average interval of 2.7 years were taken on 268 growing children who had not undergone orthodontic treatment. The T1 and T2 lateral images were manually traced. Three different superimposition methods: Bjo spacing diaeresis rk's structural method, conventional SN, and the multiple landmark (ML) superimposition methods were applied. Bjork's structural method was used as the gold standard. Comparisons among the superimposition methods were carried out by measuring the linear distances between Anterior Nasal Spine, point A, point B, and Pogonion using each superimposition method. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify factors that could affect the accuracy of the superimpositions. Results: The ML superimposition method demonstrated smaller differences from Bjo spacing diaeresis rk's method than the conventional SN method did. Greater differences among the cephalometric landmarks tested resulted when: the designated point was farther from the cranial base, the T1 age was older, and the more time elapsed between T1 and T2. Conclusions: From the results of this study in growing patients, the ML superimposition method seems to be more similar to Bjo spacing diaeresis rk's structural method than the SN superimposition method. A major advantage of the ML method is likely to be that it can be applied automatically and may be just as reliable as manual superimposition methods.

AB The last two decades of online learning research vastly flourished by examining discussion board text data through content analysis based on constructs like cognitive presence (CP) with the Practical Inquiry Model (PIM). The PIM sets a footprint for how cognitive development unfolds in collaborative inquiry in online learning experiences. Ironically, content analysis is a resource-intensive endeavor in terms of time and expertise, making researchers look for ways to automate text classification through ensemble machine-learning algorithms. We leveraged large language models (LLMs) through OpenAI's Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) models in the public API to automate the content analysis of students' text data based on PIM indicators and assess the reliability and efficiency of automated content analysis compared to human analysis. Using the seven steps of the Large Language Model Content Analysis (LACA) approach, we proposed an AI-adapted CP codebook leveraging prompt engineering techniques (i.e., role, chain-of-thought, one-shot, few-shot) for the automated content analysis of CP. We found that a fine-tuned model with a one-shot prompt achieved moderate interrater reliability with researchers. The models were more reliable when classifying students' discussion board text in the Integration phase of the PIM. A cost comparison showed an obvious cost advantage of LACA approaches in online learning research in terms of efficiency. Nevertheless, practitioners still need considerable data literacy skills to deploy LACA at a scale. We offer theoretical suggestions for simplifying the CP codebook and improving the IRR with LLM. Implications for practice are discussed, and future research that includes instructional advice is recommended.

AB HistoLens is an open-source graphical user interface developed using MATLAB AppDesigner for visual and quantitative analysis of histological datasets. HistoLens enables users to interrogate sets of digitally annotated whole slide images to efficiently characterize histological differences between disease and experimental groups. Users can dynamically visualize the distribution of 448 hand-engineered features quantifying color, texture, morphology, and distribution across microanatomic sub-compartments. Additionally, users can map differentially detected image features within the images by highlighting affected regions. We demonstrate the utility of HistoLens to identify hand-engineered features that correlate with pathognomonic renal glomerular characteristics distinguishing diabetic nephropathy and amyloid nephropathy from the histologically unremarkable glomeruli in minimal change disease. Additionally, we examine the use of HistoLens for glomerular feature discovery in the Tg26 mouse model of HIV-associated nephropathy. We identify numerous quantitative glomerular features distinguishing Tg26 transgenic mice from wild-type mice, corresponding to a progressive renal disease phenotype. Thus, we demonstrate an off-the-shelf and ready-to-use toolkit for quantitative renal pathology applications.

AB Objectives: To compare an automated cephalometric analysis based on the latest deep learning method of automatically identifying cephalometric landmarks (AI) with previously published AI according to the test style of the worldwide AI challenges at the International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging conferences held by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE ISBI).
   Materials and Methods: This latest AI was developed by using a total of 1983 cephalograms as training data. In the training procedures, a modification of a contemporary deep learning method, YOLO version 3 algorithm, was applied. Test data consisted of 200 cephalograms. To follow the same test style of the AI challenges at IEEE ISBI, a human examiner manually identified the IEEE ISBI-designated 19 cephalometric landmarks, both in training and test data sets, which were used as references for comparison. Then, the latest AI and another human examiner independently detected the same landmarks in the test data set. The test results were compared by the measures that appeared at IEEE ISBI: the success detection rate (SDR) and the success classification rates (SCR).
   Results: SDR of the latest AI in the 2-mm range was 75.5% and SCR was 81.5%. These were greater than any other previous AIs. Compared to the human examiners, AI showed a superior success classification rate in some cephalometric analysis measures.
   Conclusions: This latest AI seems to have superior performance compared to previous AI methods. It also seems to demonstrate cephalometric analysis comparable to human examiners.

AB Submucosal invasion depth is a significant prognostic factor when assessing lymph node metastasis and cancer itself to plan proper treatment for the patient. Conventionally, oncologists measure the invasion depth by hand which is a laborious, subjective, and time-consuming process. The manual pathological examination by measuring accurate carcinoma cell invasion with considerable inter-observer and intra-observer variations is still challenging. The increasing use of medical imaging and artificial intelligence reveals a significant role in clinical medicine and pathology. In this paper, we propose an approach to study invasive behavior and measure the invasion depth of carcinoma from stained histopathology images. Specifically, our model includes adaptive stain normalization, color decomposition, and morphological reconstruction with adaptive thresholding to separate the epithelium with blue ratio image. Our method splits the image into multiple non-overlapping meaningful segments and successfully finds the homogeneous segments to measure accurate invasion depth. The invasion depths are measured from the inner epithelium edge to outermost pixels of the deepest part of particles in image. We conduct our experiments on skin melanoma tissue samples as well as on organotypic invasion model utilizing myoma tissue and oral squamous cell carcinoma. The performance is experimentally compared to three closely related reference methods and our method provides a superior result in measuring invasion depth. This computational technique will be beneficial for the segmentation of epithelium and other particles for the development of novel computer-aided diagnostic tools in biobank applications.

ID RISK
AB Preterm birth (PTB) presents a complex challenge in pregnancy, often leading to significant perinatal and long-term morbidities. "While machine learning (ML) algorithms have shown promise in PTB prediction, the lack of interpretability in existing models hinders their clinical utility. This study aimed to predict PTB in a pregnant population using ML models, identify the key risk factors associated with PTB through the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm, and provide comprehensive explanations for these predictions to assist clinicians in providing appropriate care. This study analyzed a dataset of 3509 pregnant women in the United Arab Emirates and selected 35 risk factors associated with PTB based on the existing medical and artificial intelligence literature. Six ML algorithms were tested, wherein the XGBoost model exhibited the best performance, with an area under the operator receiving curves of 0.735 and 0.723 for parous and nulliparous women, respectively. The SHAP feature attribution framework was employed to identify the most significant risk factors linked to PTB. Additionally, individual patient analysis was performed using the SHAP and the local interpretable model-agnostic explanation algorithms (LIME). The overall incidence of PTB was 11.23% (11 and 12.1% in parous and nulliparous women, respectively). The main risk factors associated with PTB in parous women are previous PTB, previous cesarean section, preeclampsia during pregnancy, and maternal age. In nulliparous women, body mass index at delivery, maternal age, and the presence of amniotic infection were the most relevant risk factors. The trained ML prediction model developed in this study holds promise as a valuable screening tool for predicting PTB within this specific population. Furthermore, SHAP and LIME analyses can assist clinicians in understanding the individualized impact of each risk factor on their patients and provide appropriate care to reduce morbidity and mortality related to PTB.

AB Background Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness in American adults. If detected, DR can be treated to prevent further damage causing blindness. There is an increasing interest in developing artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to help detect DR using electronic health records. The lesion-related information documented in fundus image reports is a valuable resource that could help diagnoses of DR in clinical decision support systems. However, most studies for AI-based DR diagnoses are mainly based on medical images; there is limited studies to explore the lesion-related information captured in the free text image reports. Methods In this study, we examined two state-of-the-art transformer-based natural language processing (NLP) models, including BERT and RoBERTa, compared them with a recurrent neural network implemented using Long short-term memory (LSTM) to extract DR-related concepts from clinical narratives. We identified four different categories of DR-related clinical concepts including lesions, eye parts, laterality, and severity, developed annotation guidelines, annotated a DR-corpus of 536 image reports, and developed transformer-based NLP models for clinical concept extraction and relation extraction. We also examined the relation extraction under two settings including 'gold-standard' setting-where gold-standard concepts were used-and end-to-end setting. Results For concept extraction, the BERT model pretrained with the MIMIC III dataset achieve the best performance (0.9503 and 0.9645 for strict/lenient evaluation). For relation extraction, BERT model pretrained using general English text achieved the best strict/lenient F1-score of 0.9316. The end-to-end system, BERT_general_e2e, achieved the best strict/lenient F1-score of 0.8578 and 0.8881, respectively. Another end-to-end system based on the RoBERTa architecture, RoBERTa_general_e2e, also achieved the same performance as BERT_general_e2e in strict scores. Conclusions This study demonstrated the efficiency of transformer-based NLP models for clinical concept extraction and relation extraction. Our results show that it's necessary to pretrain transformer models using clinical text to optimize the performance for clinical concept extraction. Whereas, for relation extraction, transformers pretrained using general English text perform better.

AB Background: The implementation of large language models (LLMs), such as BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) and GPT-4, has revolutionized the extraction of insights from unstructured text. These advancements have expanded into health care, allowing analysis of social media for public health insights. However, the detection of drug discontinuation events (DDEs) remains underexplored. Identifying DDEs is crucial for understanding medication adherence and patient outcomes. Objective: The aim of this study is to provide a flexible framework for investigating various clinical research questions in data-sparse environments. We provide an example of the utility of this framework by identifying DDEs and their root causes in an open-source web-based forum, MedHelp, and by releasing the first open-source DDE datasets to aid further research in this domain. Representations from Transformer with Disentangled Attention), and BART, among others, to detect and determine the root causes of DDEs in user comments posted on MedHelp. Our study design included the use of zero-shot classification, which allows these models to make predictions without task-specific training. We split user comments into sentences and applied different classification strategies to assess the performance of these models in identifying DDEs and their root causes. Results: Among the selected models, GPT-4o performed the best at determining the root causes of DDEs, predicting only 12.9% of root causes incorrectly (hamming loss). Among the open-source models tested, BART demonstrated the best performance in detecting DDEs, achieving an F1-score of 0.86, a false positive rate of 2.8%, and a false negative rate of 6.5%, all without any fine-tuning. The dataset included 10.7% (107/1000) DDEs, emphasizing the models' robustness in an imbalanced data context. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the effectiveness of open- and closed-source LLMs, such as GPT-4o and BART, for detecting DDEs and their root causes from publicly accessible data through zero-shot classification. The robust and scalable framework we propose can aid researchers in addressing data-sparse clinical research questions. The launch of open-access DDE datasets has the potential to stimulate further research and novel discoveries in this field.

ID BIG DATA
AB The dairy industry faces significant challenges in data integration and analysis, which are critical for informed decision-making, operational optimization, and sustainability. Data integration-combining data from diverse sources, such as herd management systems, sensors, and diagnostics-remains difficult due to the lack of standardization, infrastructure barriers, and proprietary concerns. This commentary explores these issues based on insights from a multidisciplinary group of stakeholders, including industry experts, researchers, and practitioners. Key challenges discussed include the absence of a national animal identification system in the US, high IT resource costs, reluctance to share data due to competitive disadvantages, and differences in global data handling practices. Proposed pathways forward include developing comprehensive data integration guidelines, enhancing farmer awareness through training programs, and fostering collaboration across industry, academia, and technology providers. Additional recommendations involve improving data exchange standards, addressing interoperability issues, and leveraging advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence and cloud computing. Emphasis is placed on localized data integration solutions for farm-level benefits and broader research applications to advance sustainability, traceability, and profitability within the dairy supply chain. These outcomes provide a foundation for achieving streamlined data systems, enabling actionable insights, and fostering innovation in the dairy industry.

TI Federated learning for preserving data privacy in collaborative
   healthcare research
SO DIGITAL HEALTH
LA English
DT Article
DE Federated learning; deep learning; data; security; privacy
AB Generalizability, external validity, and reproducibility are high priorities for artificial intelligence applications in healthcare. Traditional approaches to addressing these elements involve sharing patient data between institutions or practice settings, which can compromise data privacy (individuals' right to prevent the sharing and disclosure of information about themselves) and data security (simultaneously preserving confidentiality, accuracy, fidelity, and availability of data). This article describes insights from real-world implementation of federated learning techniques that offer opportunities to maintain both data privacy and availability via collaborative machine learning that shares knowledge, not data. Local models are trained separately on local data. As they train, they send local model updates (e.g. coefficients or gradients) for consolidation into a global model. In some use cases, global models outperform local models on new, previously unseen local datasets, suggesting that collaborative learning from a greater number of examples, including a greater number of rare cases, may improve predictive performance. Even when sharing model updates rather than data, privacy leakage can occur when adversaries perform property or membership inference attacks which can be used to ascertain information about the training set. Emerging techniques mitigate risk from adversarial attacks, allowing investigators to maintain both data privacy and availability in collaborative healthcare research. When data heterogeneity between participating centers is high, personalized algorithms may offer greater generalizability by improving performance on data from centers with proportionately smaller training sample sizes. Properly applied, federated learning has the potential to optimize the reproducibility and performance of collaborative learning while preserving data security and privacy.

ID SPEAKER
AB Organizations across the world, including NATO, OECD, the WHO, and the United Nations, as well as many governments, are now employing guidelines for safe, secure, and trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI). While technology policies are still being formulated, many AI applications catered toward children have already been developed or are still developing. While designing any child-centered AI, it is utmost importance to keep the children's privacy at the forefront. One modality for child-centered AI is speech/language communication, which has found applications in various educational technologies, tutoring services, as well as interactive learning and social robots. Although, short of a full de-identification of speech segments, longer duration sentences and audio content could reveal partial neutral identifying information (e.g., gender of a child, etc.), but if taken in longer duration context with sequenced longitudinal data (e.g., audio recordings over full days at home or in classrooms, and linked over time), privacy concerns will grow and be critical. Motivated by a privacy-preserving design, this study explores the use of discrete speech units as a form of anonymous encoding, to develop Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems for children that better ensure privacy protection. The primary goal here is to ascertain that discrete speech units retain the key linguistic information for the ASR task of output text creation, but simultaneously lack identifying speaker-specific information, or the ability to potentially re-generate the original speech waveform given the available sequence of discrete speech units. Here, a Discrete ASR model trained on the My Science Tutor Children's Conversational Speech Corpus (MyST) archives an output word-error-rate (WER) of 15.7%. Our Discrete ASR model achieves similar performance in terms of WER when compared to state-of-the-art End-to-End (E2E) ASR models trained using features extracted from large-scale self-supervised pre-trained speech processing model (such as WavLM), although it is noted that E2E ASR models are almost 10 times larger in model checkpoint memory size and number of model parameters and takes 3x the amount of time to train. In addition, open-domain testing on other popular child speech corpora confirms that the proposed Discrete ASR models perform equal to E2E ASR models for corpora containing children speech in the same age range as MyST (e.g., CMU corpus) and slightly lower performance for a corpus containing a wider age range of children (e.g., OGI corpus). Finally, this study also shows that child ASR using the proposed discrete speech units achieves promising performance in recognizing WH-Words, Nouns, Verbs, and Pronouns in an early childhood case study of teacher-child interactions in a childcare facility, involving preschool children with and without speech/language delays which is an extremely vulnerable and challenging speech/language assessment population.

AB Psychiatry is rapidly adopting digital phenotyping and artificial intelligence/machine learning tools to study mental illness based on tracking participants' locations, online activity, phone and text message usage, heart rate, sleep, physical activity, and more. Existing ethical frameworks for return of individual research results (IRRs) are inadequate to guide researchers for when, if, and how to return this unprecedented number of potentially sensitive results about each participant's real-world behavior. To address this gap, we convened an interdisciplinary expert working group, supported by a National Institute of Mental Health grant. Building on established guidelines and the emerging norm of returning results in participant-centered research, we present a novel framework specific to the ethical, legal, and social implications of returning IRRs in digital phenotyping research. Our framework offers researchers, clinicians, and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) urgently needed guidance, and the principles developed here in the context of psychiatry will be readily adaptable to other therapeutic areas.

AB Simple Summary Endometrial cancer and mixed M & uuml;llerian tumors are different types of uterine malignancies, yet differentiating these diseases can be challenging and often requires surgery. A timely and accurate diagnosis of these conditions is crucial for providing optimal treatment options. The emerging field of radiomics may assist clinicians in diagnosing these conditions preoperatively by extracting complex patterns from clinical imaging to identify features unique to each type of tumor. This study aims to analyze radiomics data from patients with endometrial cancer and mixed M & uuml;llerian tumors to identify distinguishing features that could help clinicians diagnose each disease.Abstract The objective of this study was to compare the quantitative radiomics data between malignant mixed M & uuml;llerian tumors (MMMTs) and endometrial carcinoma (EC) and identify texture features associated with overall survival (OS). This study included 61 patients (36 with EC and 25 with MMMTs) and analyzed various radiomic features and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features. These variables and patient clinicopathologic characteristics were compared between EC and MMMTs using the Wilcoxon Rank sum and Fisher's exact test. The area under the curve of the receiving operating characteristics (AUC ROC) was calculated for univariate analysis in predicting EC status. Logistic regression with elastic net regularization was performed for texture feature selection. This study showed that skewness (p = 0.045) and tumor volume (p = 0.007) significantly differed between EC and MMMTs. The range of cluster shade, the angular variance of cluster shade, and the range of the sum of squares variance were significant predictors of EC status (p <= 0.05). The regularized Cox regression analysis identified the "256 Angular Variance of Energy" texture feature as significantly associated with OS independently of the EC/MMMT grouping (p = 0.004). The volume and texture features of the tumor region may help distinguish between EC and MMMTs and predict patient outcomes.

This study assessed (1) the performance of spotted spurge recognition in 'Latitude 36' bermudagrass turf canopy using the You Only Look Once (YOLOv3) real-time multiobject detection algorithm and (2) the impact of various nozzle densities on model efficiency and projected herbicide reduction under simulated conditions. The YOLOv3 model was trained and validated with a data set of 1,191 images. The simulation design consisted of four grid matrix regimes (3 x 3, 6 x 6, 12 x 12, and 24 x 24), which would then correspond to 3, 6, 12, and 24 nonoverlapping nozzles, respectively, covering a 50-cm-wide band. Simulated efficiency testing was conducted using 50 images containing predictions (labels) generated with the trained YOLO model and by applying each of the grid matrixes to individual images. The model resulted in prediction accuracy of an F1 score of 0.62, precision of 0.65, and a recall value of 0.60. Increased nozzle density (from 3 to 12) improved actuator precision and predicted herbicide-use efficiency with a reduction in the false hits ratio from similar to 30% to 5%. The area required to ensure herbicide deposition to all spotted spurge detected within images was reduced to 18%, resulting in similar to 80% herbicide savings compared to broadcast application. Slightly greater precision was predicted with 24 nozzles but was not statistically different from the 12-nozzle scenario. Using this turf/weed model as a basis, optimal actuator efficacy and herbicide savings would occur by increasing nozzle density from 1 to 12 nozzles within the context of a single band.

AB Background:Surrogates, proxies, and clinicians making shared treatment decisions for patients who have lost decision-making capacity often fail to honor patients' wishes, due to stress, time pressures, misunderstanding patient values, and projecting personal biases. Advance directives intend to align care with patient values but are limited by low completion rates and application to only a subset of medical decisions. Here, we investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to incorporate patient values in supporting critical care clinical decision-making for incapacitated patients in a proof-of-concept study.Methods:We simulated text-based scenarios for 50 decisionally incapacitated patients for whom a medical condition required imminent clinical decisions regarding specific interventions. For each patient, we also simulated five unique value profiles captured using alternative formats: numeric ranking questionnaires, text-based questionnaires, and free-text narratives. We used pre-trained generative LLMs for two tasks: 1) text extraction of the treatments under consideration and 2) prompt-based question-answering to generate a recommendation in response to the scenario information, extracted treatment, and patient value profiles. Model outputs were compared with adjudications by three domain experts who independently evaluated each scenario and decision.Results and Conclusions:Automated extractions of the treatment in question were accurate for 88% (n = 44/50) of scenarios. LLM treatment recommendations received an average Likert score by the adjudicators of 3.92 of 5.00 (five being best) across all patients for being medically plausible and reasonable treatment recommendations, and 3.58 of 5.00 for reflecting the documented values of the patient. Scores were highest when patient values were captured as short, unstructured, and free-text narratives based on simulated patient profiles. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the potential for LLMs to function as support tools for surrogates, proxies, and clinicians aiming to honor the wishes and values of decisionally incapacitated patients.

AB The landscape of medical treatments is undergoing a transformative shift. Precision medicine has ushered in a revolutionary era in healthcare by individualizing diagnostics and treatments according to each patient's uniquely evolving health status. This groundbreaking method of tailoring disease prevention and treatment considers individual variations in genes, environments, and lifestyles. The goal of precision medicine is to target the "five rights": the right patient, the right drug, the right time, the right dose, and the right route. In this pursuit, in silico techniques have emerged as an anchor, driving precision medicine forward and making this a realistic and promising avenue for personalized therapies. With the advancements in high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies, genomic data, including genetic variants and their interactions with each other and the environment, can be incorporated into clinical decision-making. Pharmacometrics, gathering pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) data, and mathematical models further contribute to drug optimization, drug behavior prediction, and drug-drug interaction identification. Digital health, wearables, and computational tools offer continuous monitoring and real-time data collection, enabling treatment adjustments. Furthermore, the incorporation of extensive datasets in computational tools, such as electronic health records (EHRs) and omics data, is also another pathway to acquire meaningful information in this field. Although they are fairly new, machine learning (ML) algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques are also resources researchers use to analyze big data and develop predictive models. This review explores the interplay of these multiple in silico approaches in advancing precision medicine and fostering individual healthcare. Despite intrinsic challenges, such as ethical considerations, data protection, and the need for more comprehensive research, this marks a new era of patient-centered healthcare. Innovative in silico techniques hold the potential to reshape the future of medicine for generations to come.

AB Individual microbes often have defined relationships with their hosts that include beneficial, commensal, and pathogenic interactions. However, at the community level, plant microbiomes are considered to play a beneficial role in protecting the plant from potential pathogens, acquiring nutrients, and improving growth and production. Citrus is a globally important perennial fruit crop and its production faces many challenges. There has been tremendous interest in exploring the structure and function of the citrus microbiome and engineering the citrus microbiome to address various challenges. In this review, we summarized recent advances in understanding the citrus microbiome, including the composition and function of the microbiome in the rhizosphere, rhizoplane, endorhiza, and core members, and their functional traits. We conducted comparisons of the citrus root-associated microbiome with other plant root-associated microbiomes. We also present a perspective on how incoming pathogens interact with the resident microbial community and their outcomes. Despite the promising potential of the citrus microbiome to combat disease, harnessing the citrus microbiome for beneficial applications remains in its infancy. We envision that rapid development of high-throughput sequencing and multiomics technologies, artificial intelligence, consortia of microbes, genome editing technology, and high-throughput culturing present many exciting opportunities for citrus microbiome research and microbial engineering to improve citrus health and productivity.

AB Deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are an emerging technology that provide an opportunity to increase agricultural efficiency through remote sensing and automatic inferencing of field conditions. This paper examined the novel use of CNNs to identify two weeds, hair fescue and sheep sorrel, in images of wild blueberry fields. Commercial herbicide sprayers provide a uniform application of agrochemicals to manage patches of these weeds. Three object-detection and three image-classification CNNs were trained to identify hair fescue and sheep sorrel using images from 58 wild blueberry fields. The CNNs were trained using 1280x720 images and were tested at four different internal resolutions. The CNNs were retrained with progressively smaller training datasets ranging from 3780 to 472 images to determine the effect of dataset size on accuracy. YOLOv3-Tiny was the best object-detection CNN, detecting at least one target weed per image with F-1-scores of 0.97 for hair fescue and 0.90 for sheep sorrel at 1280 x 736 resolution. Darknet Reference was the most accurate image-classification CNN, classifying images containing hair fescue and sheep sorrel with F-1-scores of 0.96 and 0.95, respectively at 1280 x 736. MobileNetV2 achieved comparable results at the lowest resolution, 864 x 480, with F-1-scores of 0.95 for both weeds. Training dataset size had minimal effect on accuracy for all CNNs except Darknet Reference. This technology can be used in a smart sprayer to control target specific spray applications, reducing herbicide use. Future work will involve testing the CNNs for use on a smart sprayer and the development of an application to provide growers with field-specific information. Using CNNs to improve agricultural efficiency will create major cost-savings for wild blueberry producers.

AB Purpose:To compare texture-based analysis using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) against lung densitometry in detecting chest computed tomography (CT) image abnormalities.Material and Methods:A U-NET was used for lung segmentation, and an ensemble of 7 CNN architectures was trained for the classification of low-attenuation areas (LAAs; emphysema, cysts), normal-attenuation areas (NAAs; normal parenchyma), and high-attenuation areas (HAAs; ground-glass opacities, crazy paving/linear opacity, consolidation). Lung densitometry also computes (LAAs, <=-950 HU), NAAs (-949 to -700 HU), and HAAs (-699 to -250 HU). CNN-based and densitometry-based severity indices (CNN and Dens, respectively) were calculated as (LAA+HAA)/(LAA+NAA+HAA) in 812 CT scans from 176 normal subjects, 343 patients with emphysema, and 293 patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD). The correlation between CNN-derived and densitometry-derived indices was analyzed, alongside a comparison of severity indices among patient subgroups with emphysema and ILD, using the Spearman correlation and ANOVA with Bonferroni correction.Results:CNN-derived and densitometry-derived severity indices (SIs) showed a strong correlation (rho=0.90) and increased with disease severity. CNN-SIs differed from densitometry SIs, being lower for emphysema and higher for moderate to severe ILD cases. CNN estimations for normal attenuation areas were higher than those from densitometry across all groups, indicating a potential for more accurate characterization of lung abnormalities.Conclusions:CNN outputs align closely with densitometry in assessing lung abnormalities on CT scans, offering improved estimates of normal areas and better distinguishing similar abnormalities. However, this requires higher computing power.

AB As a critical indicator of plant growth and water use, accurately and promptly estimating leaf area index (LAI) is critical for improved crop management. However, measuring LAI requires substantial effort and time . The main objective of this study was to leverage vegetation indices (VIs) generated from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)based images and machine learning (ML) techniques for estimating LAI of green beans and sweet corn. The research was conducted at the Tropical Research and Education Center (TREC), University of Florida, Homestead, Florida over three seasons from 2020-2023. The experiment for each crop consisted of four irrigation treatments, i.e., 100 % full irrigation (FI), 75 %, 50 %, and 25 % FI, with four replications. Destructive leaf samples were collected by cutting plants from 30 cm row length of two inner plot rows and leaf area (LA) was measured using a LI-3000C transparent belt conveyor. Plant height and canopy width were also measured biweekly. Moreover, a UAV-based RedEdge-MX sensor was employed throughout the seasons to collect high- resolution multispectral imageries that consist of five bands. Plant LAI was calculated using the plant density method from measured LA. A calibrated DSSAT model was used to simulate the LAI for both crops.. Simulated LAI from DSSAT was compared against measured LAI, and relationships were established between simulated LAI and 12 VIs generated from UAV images. Additionally, ML algorithms, i.e., random forest (RF), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGB), and light gradient boosting (LGB) models, were trained to predict LAI for both crops using VIs as input features. Results showed DSSAT's perfroamnce in simulating LAI was good for green beans and reasonable for sweet corn. Out of the 12 indices tested, six VIs, i.e., Enhanced Vegetation Index 2 (EVI2), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Green Red Difference Index (NGRDI), NIR-RE Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NIRRENDVI), Red-Edge Normalized Vegetation Index (RENDVI), and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) showed a good agreement with simulated LAI for both crops. The LGB, RF, and XGB models predicted LAI with acceptable accuracy, achieving r2 values of 0.78, 0.90, and 0.90 and RMSE values of 0.43, 0.29, and 0.28 for sweet corn and r2 of 0.72, 0.79, and 0.80 and RMSE of 1.01, 0.86, and 0.85 for green beans, respectively. The findings indicate that ML models and VIs derived from UAV imagery could be used to predict LAI with acceptable accuracy for green beans and sweet corn.

AB This study evaluated the potential of using machine vision in combination with deep learning (DL) to identify the early blight disease in real-time for potato production systems. Four fields were selected to collect images (n = 5199) of healthy and diseased potato plants under variable lights and shadow effects. A database was constructed using DL to identify the disease infestation at different stages throughout the growing season. Three convolutional neural networks (CNNs), namely GoogleNet, VGGNet, and EfficientNet, were trained using the PyTorch framework. The disease images were classified into three classes (2-class, 4-class, and 6-class) for accurate disease identification at different growth stages. Results of 2-class CNNs for disease identification revealed the significantly better performance of EfficientNet and VGGNet when compared with the GoogleNet (FScore range: 0.84-0.98). Results of 4-Class CNNs indicated better performance of EfficientNet when compared with other CNNs (FScore range: 0.79-0.94). Results of 6-class CNNs showed similar results as 4-class, with EfficientNet performing the best. GoogleNet, VGGNet, and EfficientNet inference time values ranged from 6.8-8.3, 2.1-2.5, 5.95-6.53 frames per second, respectively, on a Dell Latitude 5580 using graphical processing unit (GPU) mode. Overall, the CNNs and DL frameworks used in this study accurately classified the early blight disease at different stages. Site-specific application of fungicides by accurately identifying the early blight infected plants has a strong potential to reduce agrochemicals use, improve the profitability of potato growers, and lower environmental risks (runoff of fungicides to water bodies).

TI Finding Universal Relations in Subhalo Properties with Artificial

SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL

DT Article
ID SIMULATING GALAXY FORMATION; ILLUSTRISTNG SIMULATIONS
AB We use a generic formalism designed to search for relations in high-dimensional spaces to determine if the total mass of a subhalo can be predicted from other internal properties such as velocity dispersion, radius, or star formation rate. We train neural networks using data from the Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations project and show that the model can predict the total mass of a subhalo with high accuracy: more than 99% of the subhalos have a predicted mass within 0.2 dex of their true value. The networks exhibit surprising extrapolation properties, being able to accurately predict the total mass of any type of subhalo containing any kind of galaxy at any redshift from simulations with different cosmologies, astrophysics models, subgrid physics, volumes, and resolutions, indicating that the network may have found a universal relation. We then use different methods to find equations that approximate the relation found by the networks and derive new analytic expressions that predict the total mass of a subhalo from its radius, velocity dispersion, and maximum circular velocity. We show that in some regimes, the analytic expressions are more accurate than the neural networks. The relation found by the neural network and approximated by the analytic equation bear similarities to the virial theorem.

AB Background Advancements in machine learning (ML) have improved the accuracy of models that predict human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) incidence. These models have used electronic medical records and registries. We aim to broaden the application of these tools by using deidentified public health datasets for notifiable sexually transmitted infections (STIs) from a southern US county known for high HIV incidence. The goal is to assess the feasibility and accuracy of ML in predicting HIV incidence, which could inform and enhance public health interventions.Methods We analyzed 2 deidentified public health datasets from January 2010 to December 2021, focusing on notifiable STIs. Our process involved data processing and feature extraction, including sociodemographic factors, STI cases, and social vulnerability index (SVI) metrics. Various ML models were trained and evaluated for predicting HIV incidence using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.Results We included 85 224 individuals; 2027 (2.37%) were newly diagnosed with HIV during the study period. The ML models demonstrated high performance in predicting HIV incidence among males and females. Influential features for males included age at STI diagnosis, previous STI information, provider type, and SVI. For females, predictive features included age, ethnicity, previous STI information, overall SVI, and race.Conclusions The high accuracy of our ML models in predicting HIV incidence highlights the potential of using public health datasets for public health interventions such as tailored HIV testing and prevention. While these findings are promising, further research is needed to translate these models into practical public health applications.
   We applied machine learning to predict HIV incidence in a high-incidence US county using deidentified public health data, focusing on sociodemographic factors and sexually transmitted infections. The models showed high accuracy, suggesting the potential for guiding public health strategies.

AB An explainable artificial intelligence approach based on consolidating the Local Interpretable and Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME) mod& outputs was devised to discern the influence of the surface morphology on the colors exhibited by stainless-steel 304 parts polished with a Magnetic Abrasive Finishing (MAF) process. The MAF polishing process was used to create two regions, each appearing either blue or red to the naked eye. The color distribution was microscopically heterogeneous, i.e., some red microscale patches were dispersed in blue regions, and vice versa. The surface morphology was represented in the frequency domain (using a 2D Fourier transform) to capture the harmonic surface patterns, such as the feed and lay marks from the polishing process. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was employed to identify the color of the region from the frequency characteristics of the surface morphology. The CNN was able to predict the observed colors with test accuracies exceeding 99%, suggesting that the frequency characteristics of the surface morphology of the red regions are distinctly different from those of the blue regions. A LIME model was constructed around each small segment within each region of the surface to identify the frequency features that are influential for differentiating between the colors. To deal with the effect of heterogeneity, an algorithm based on the query by experts was used to reconcile the local influences and gather the global explanations of the frequency characteristics that inform the blue versus red regions. We found that the dominant morphological features in the red regions are those that capture the polishing lay patterns underlying surface structure, whereas those in the blue regions capture the non-uniform and high-frequency waveform patterns, such as those result when oxide films form due to the intense polishing conditions.

AB Historically, murine models of inflammation in biomedical research have been shown to minimally correlate with genomic expression patterns from blood leukocytes in humans. In 2019, our laboratory reported an improved surgical sepsis model of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) that provides additional daily chronic stress (DCS), as well as adhering to the Minimum Quality Threshold in Pre-Clinical Sepsis Studies (MQTiPSS) guidelines. This model phenotypically recapitulates the persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome observed in adult human surgical sepsis survivors. Whether these phenotypic similarities between septic humans and mice are replicated at the circulating blood leukocyte transcriptome has not been demonstrated. Our analysis, in contrast with previous findings, demonstrated that genome-wide expression in our new murine model more closely approximated human surgical sepsis patients, particularly in the more chronic phases of sepsis. Importantly, our new model of murine surgical sepsis with chronic stress did not reflect well gene expression patterns from humans with community-acquired sepsis. Our work indicates that improved preclinical murine sepsis modeling can better replicate both the phenotypic and transcriptomic responses to surgical sepsis, but cannot be extrapolated to other sepsis etiologies. Importantly, these improved models can be a useful adjunct to human-focused and artificial intelligence-based forms of research in order to improve septic patients' morbidity and mortality.

ID CLASSIFICATION
AB Pests can cause huge yield loss in crop production without timely and effective monitoring methods. The traditional method of manually counting pests is time-consuming and causes bias between different observers. Therefore, this study developed an Android -based smartphone application for automated pest counting using a deep learning model (YOLOv7 tiny). This study evaluated the smartphone application using twospotted spider mite (TSSM) detection as a case study and compared it with the manual counting method. The smartphone application records the total number of pests and the GPS coordinates into a MySQL database. The spatial interpolation method was used to generate a spatial distribution map of TSSM in real-time, which could guide growers to apply the right amount of pesticide at the right location. To train the deep learning model for TSSM detection, 3,348 images were collected using three smartphones. The YOLOv7 tiny model was trained at three input image sizes (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640 pixels). The model trained at 320x320 pixels was chosen to deploy on the smartphone application because of the superior performance for both detection accuracy and inference speed. The Android -based smartphone application was installed on two widely used smartphones (Samsung Galaxy S10e and LG Stylo 6) for field testing. The counting accuracy of TSSM motiles (all life stages except eggs) and TSSM eggs using the smartphone application was 78.1% and 75.3%, respectively. The average counting speed of the smartphone application was 233 s per strawberry (trifoliate) leaf. The smartphone application had higher counting accuracy (7.1% higher for TSSM motiles and 12.7% higher for TSSM eggs) and speed (29 s faster per leaf) than manual counting using a magnifying lens. The quick assessment of field conditions with smartphone technology can allow growers to implement quick management tactics and potentially reduce the amount of pesticides to manage TSSM, which can save growers money and protect the environment.

AB Purpose Prior studies show convolutional neural networks predicting self-reported race using x-rays of chest, hand and spine, chest computed tomography, and mammogram. We seek an understanding of the mechanism that reveals race within x-ray images, investigating the possibility that race is not predicted using the physical structure in x-ray images but is embedded in the grayscale pixel intensities.Approach Retrospective full year 2021, 298,827 AP/PA chest x-ray images from 3 academic health centers across the United States and MIMIC-CXR, labeled by self-reported race, were used in this study. The image structure is removed by summing the number of each grayscale value and scaling to percent per image (PPI). The resulting data are tested using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) with Bonferroni multiple-comparison adjustment and class-balanced MANOVA. Machine learning (ML) feed-forward networks (FFN) and decision trees were built to predict race (binary Black or White and binary Black or other) using only grayscale value counts. Stratified analysis by body mass index, age, sex, gender, patient type, make/model of scanner, exposure, and kilovoltage peak setting was run to study the impact of these factors on race prediction following the same methodology.Results MANOVA rejects the null hypothesis that classes are the same with 95% confidence (F 7.38, P < 0.0001) and balanced MANOVA (F 2.02, P < 0.0001). The best FFN performance is limited [area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 69.18%]. Gradient boosted trees predict self-reported race using grayscale PPI (AUROC 77.24%).Conclusions Within chest x-rays, pixel intensity value counts alone are statistically significant indicators and enough for ML classification tasks of patient self-reported race.

AB Grapevine yellows (GY) are a significant threat to grapes due to the severe symptoms and lack of treatments. Conventional diagnosis of the phytoplasmas associated to GYs relies on symptom identification, due to sensitivity limits of diagnostic tools (e.g. real time PCR) in asymptomatic vines, where the low concentration of the pathogen or its erratic distribution can lead to a high rate of false-negatives. GY's primary symptoms are leaf discoloration and irregular wood ripening, which can be easily confused for symptoms of other diseases making recognition a difficult task. Herein, we present a novel system, utilizing convolutional neural networks, for end to-end detection of GY in red grape vine (cv. Sangiovese), using color images of leaf clippings. The diagnostic test detailed in this work does not require the user to be an expert at identifying GY. Data augmentation strategies make the system robust to alignment errors during data capture. When applied to the task of recognizing GY from digital images of leaf clippings-amongst many other diseases and a healthy control the system has a sensitivity of 98.96% and a specificity of 99.40%. Deep learning has 35.97% and 9.88% better predictive value (PPV) when recognizing GY from sight, than a baseline system without deep learning and trained humans respectively. We evaluate six neural network architectures: AlexNet, GoogLeNet, Inception v3, ResNet-50, ResNet-101 and SqueezeNet. We find ResNet-50 to be the best compromise of accuracy and training cost. The trained neural networks, code to reproduce the experiments, and data of leaf clipping images are available on the internet. This work will advance the frontier of GY detection by improving detection speed, enabling a more effective response to the disease.

AB Urban systems involve a multitude of closely intertwined components, which are more measurable than before due to new sensors, data collection, and spatio-temporal analysis methods. Turning these data into knowledge to facilitate planning efforts in addressing current challenges of urban complex systems requires advanced interdisciplinary analysis methods, such as urban informatics or urban data science. Yet, by applying a purely data-driven approach, it is too easy to get lost in the 'forest' of data, and to miss the 'trees' of successful, livable cities that are the ultimate aim of urban planning. This paper assesses how geospatial data, and urban analysis, using a mixed methods approach, can help to better understand urban dynamics and human behavior, and how it can assist planning efforts to improve livability. Based on reviewing state-of-the-art research the paper goes one step further and also addresses the potential as well as limitations of new data sources in urban analytics to get a better overview of the whole 'forest' of these new data sources and analysis methods. The main discussion revolves around the reliability of using big data from social media platforms or sensors, and how information can be extracted from massive amounts of data through novel analysis methods, such as machine learning, for better-informed decision making aiming at urban livability improvement.

AB We present the Cosmology and Astrophysics with Machine Learning Simulations (CAMELS) Multifield Data set (CMD), a collection of hundreds of thousands of 2D maps and 3D grids containing many different properties of cosmic gas, dark matter, and stars from more than 2000 distinct simulated universes at several cosmic times. The 2D maps and 3D grids represent cosmic regions that span similar to 100 million light-years and have been generated from thousands of state-of-the-art hydrodynamic and gravity-only N-body simulations from the CAMELS project. Designed to train machine-learning models, CMD is the largest data set of its kind containing more than 70 TB of data. In this paper we describe CMD in detail and outline a few of its applications. We focus our attention on one such task, parameter inference, formulating the problems we face as a challenge to the community. We release all data and provide further technical details at https://camels-multifield-dataset.readthedocs.io.

TI A scoping review of fair machine learning techniques when using
   real-world data

AB Objective: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in health care to aid clinical decisions is widespread. However, as AI and ML take important roles in health care, there are concerns about AI and ML associated fairness and bias. That is, an AI tool may have a disparate impact, with its benefits and drawbacks unevenly distributed across societal strata and subpopulations, potentially exacerbating existing health inequities. Thus, the objectives of this scoping review were to summarize existing literature and identify gaps in the topic of tackling algorithmic bias and optimizing fairness in AI/ML models using real -world data (RWD) in health care domains. Methods: We conducted a thorough review of techniques for assessing and optimizing AI/ML model fairness in health care when using RWD in health care domains. The focus lies on appraising different quantification metrics for accessing fairness, publicly accessible datasets for ML fairness research, and bias mitigation approaches. Results: We identified 11 papers that are focused on optimizing model fairness in health care applications. The current research on mitigating bias issues in RWD is limited, both in terms of disease variety and health care applications, as well as the accessibility of public datasets for ML fairness research. Existing studies often indicate positive outcomes when using pre-processing techniques to address algorithmic bias. There remain unresolved questions within the field that require further research, which includes pinpointing the root causes of bias in ML models, broadening fairness research in AI/ML with the use of RWD and exploring its implications in healthcare settings, and evaluating and addressing bias in multi -modal data. Conclusion: This paper provides useful reference material and insights to researchers regarding AI/ML fairness in real -world health care data and reveals the gaps in the field. Fair AI/ML in health care is a burgeoning field that requires a heightened research focus to cover diverse applications and different types of RWD.

AB Photo-identification of individual snow leopards (Panthera uncia) is the primary data source for density estimation via capture-recapture statistical methods. To identify individual snow leopards in camera trap imagery, it is necessary to match individuals from a large number of images from multiple cameras and historical catalogues, which is both time-consuming and costly. The camouflaged snow leopards also make it difficult for machine learning to classify photos, as they blend in so well with the surrounding mountain environment, rendering applicable software solutions unavailable for the species. To potentially make snow leopard individual identification available via an artificial intelligence (AI) software interface, we first trained and evaluated image classification techniques for a convolutional neural network, pose invariant embeddings (PIE) (a triplet loss network), and compared the accuracy of PIE to that of the HotSpotter algorithm (a SIFT-based algorithm). Data were acquired from a curated library of free-ranging snow leopards taken in Afghanistan between 2012 and 2019 and from captive animals in zoos in Finland, Sweden, Germany, and the United States. We discovered several flaws in the initial PIE model, such as a small amount of background matching, that was addressed, albeit likely not fixed, using background subtraction (BGS) and left-right mirroring (LR) techniques which demonstrated reasonable accuracy (Rank 1: 74% Rank-5: 92%) comparable to the Hotspotter results (Rank 1: 74% Rank 2: 84%)The PIE BGS LR model, in conjunction with Hotspotter, yielded the following results: Rank-1: 85%, Rank-5: 95%, Rank-20: 99%. In general, our findings indicate that PIE BGS LR, in conjunction with HotSpotter, can classify snow leopards more accurately than using either algorithm alone.

AB Objectives: Technology has substantial potential to transform and extend care for persons with chronic pain, a burdensome and costly condition. To catalyze the development of impactful applications of technology in this space, we developed the Pain Tech Landscape (PTL) model, which integrates pain care needs with characteristics of technological solutions. Methods: Our interdisciplinary group representing experts in pain and human factors research developed PTL through iterative discussions. To demonstrate one potential use of the model, we apply data generated from a narrative review of selected pain and technology journals (2000-2020) in the form of heat map overlays, to reveal where pain tech research attention has focused to date. Results: The PTL comprises three two-dimensional planes, with pain care needs on each x axis (measurement to management) and technology applications on the y axes according to a) user agency (user- to system-driven), b) usage time frame (temporary to lifelong), and c) collaboration (single-user to collaborative). Heat maps show that existing applications reside primarily in the "user-driven/management" quadrant (e.g., self-care apps). Examples of less developed areas include artificial intelligence and Internet of Things (i.e., Internet-linked household objects), and collaborative/social tools for pain management. Conclusions: Collaborative development between the pain and tech fields in early developmental stages using the PTL as a common language could yield impactful solutions for chronic pain management. The PTL could also be used to track developments in the field over time. We encourage periodic reassessment and refinement of the PTL model, which can also be adapted to other chronic conditions.

AB Prediction of chemical bioactivity and physical properties has been one of the most important applications of statistical and more recently, machine learning and artificial intelligence methods in chemical sciences. This field of research, broadly known as quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) modeling, has developed many important algorithms and has found a broad range of applications in physical organic and medicinal chemistry in the past 55+ years. This Perspective summarizes recent technological advances in QSAR modeling but it also highlights the applicability of algorithms, modeling methods, and validation practices developed in QSAR to a wide range of research areas outside of traditional QSAR boundaries including synthesis planning, nanotechnology, materials science, biomaterials, and clinical informatics. As modern research methods generate rapidly increasing amounts of data, the knowledge of robust data-driven modelling methods professed within the QSAR field can become essential for scientists working both within and outside of chemical research. We hope that this contribution highlighting the generalizable components of QSAR modeling will serve to address this challenge.

AB Researchers are rapidly developing and deploying highly portable MRI technology to conduct field-based research. The new technology will widen access to include new investigators in remote and unconventional settings and will facilitate greater inclusion of rural, economically disadvantaged, and historically underrepresented populations. To address the ethical, legal, and societal issues raised by highly accessible and portable MRI, an interdisciplinary Working Group (WG) engaged in a multi-year structured process of analysis and consensus building, informed by empirical research on the perspectives of experts and the general public. This article presents the WG's consensus recommendations. These recommendations address technology quality control, design and oversight of research, including safety of research participants and others in the scanning environment, engagement of diverse participants, therapeutic misconception, use of artificial intelligence algorithms to acquire and analyze MRI data, data privacy and security, return of results and managing incidental findings, and research participant data access and control.

AB Corneal biomechanics has been a hot topic for research in contemporary ophthalmology due to its prospective applications in diagnosis, management, and treatment of several clinical conditions, including glaucoma, elective keratorefractive surgery, and different corneal diseases. The clinical biomechanical investigation has become of great importance in the setting of refractive surgery to identify patients at higher risk of developing iatrogenic ectasia after laser vision correction. This review discusses the latest developments in the detection of corneal ectatic diseases. These developments should be considered in conjunction with multimodal corneal and refractive imaging, including Placido-disk based corneal topography, Scheimpflug corneal tomography, anterior segment tomography, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), very-high-frequency ultrasound (VHF-US), ocular biometry, and ocular wavefront measurements. The ocular response analyzer (ORA) and the Corvis ST are non-contact tonometry systems that provide a clinical corneal biomechanical assessment. More recently, Brillouin optical microscopy has been demonstrated to provide in vivo biomechanical measurements. The integration of tomographic and biomechanical data into artificial intelligence techniques has demonstrated the ability to increase the accuracy to detect ectatic disease and characterize the inherent susceptibility for biomechanical failure and ectasia progression, which is a severe complication after laser vision correction.

AB Proximity to roads is one of the main determinants of deforestation in the Amazon basin. Determining the construction year of roads (CYR) is critical to improve the understanding of the drivers of road construction and to enable predictions of the expansion of the road network and its consequent impact on ecosystems. While recent artificial intelligence approaches have been successfully used for road extraction, they have typically relied on high spatial-resolution imagery, precluding their adoption for the determination of CYR for older roads. In this article, we developed a new approach to automate the process of determining CYR that relies on the approximate position of the current road network and a time-series of the proportion of exposed soil based on the multidecadal remote sensing imagery from the Landsat program. Starting with these inputs, our methodology relies on the Least Cost Path algorithm to co-register the road network and on a Before-After Control-Impact design to circumvent the inherent image-to-image variability in the estimated amount of exposed soil. We demonstrate this approach for a 357 000 km(2) area around the Transamazon highway (BR-230) in the Brazilian Amazon, encompassing 36 240 road segments. The reliability of this approach is assessed by comparing the estimated CYR using our approach to the observed CYR based on a time-series of Landsat images. This exercise reveals a close correspondence between the estimated and observed CYR (r(Pearson )= 0.77). Finally, we show how these data can be used to assess the effectiveness of protected areas (PAs) in reducing the yearly rate of road construction and thus their vulnerability to future degradation. In particular, we find that integral protection PAs in this region were generally more effective in reducing the expansion of the road network when compared to sustainable use PAs.

AB Identification of best performing fertilizer practices with on-farm trials is challenging, in particular in rainfed farming due to weather uncertainty. However, it remains crucial to test a range of viable practices to ascertain their performances, given that they are not known beforehand. This process also involves the testing of practices that could potentially yield inferior results in comparison to the best available practice(s). To identify a best management practice, an "intuitive strategy" typically sets up multi-year, multi-location field trials, wherein each practice is tested in a proportionally equal manner over a set number of years. Our objective was to provide an identification strategy for nitrogen fertilizer management designing a bandit learning algorithm. We aimed for the bandit algorithm to be better at minimizing farmers' losses occurring from the testing of management practices that do not perform best, compared with the "intuitive strategy" that was formulized as the ExploreThen-Commit strategy. Our case study was for maize production in southern Mali. Bandit framework is a machine learning approach in which an agent learns from the feedback over time and accordingly selects actions in order to maximize its cumulative reward in the long term. To mimic the maize responses to nitrogen fertilization, we used the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop model. We compared nitrogen fertilizer practices using a risk-aware measure, the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), and a novel agronomic metric, the Yield Excess (YE). The YE accounts for both grain yield and agronomic nitrogen use efficiency. The bandit algorithm performed better than the intuitive strategy: it minimized farmers' yield losses during the identification process. This study is a methodological step which opens up new horizons for risk-aware identification of the performance of a range of crop management practices in real conditions.

AB We present a data-driven, in situ proximal multi-sensor digital soil mapping approach to develop digital twins for multiple agricultural fields. A novel Digital Soil CoreTM (DSC) Probe was engineered that contains seven sensors, each of a distinct modality, including sleeve friction, tip force, dielectric permittivity, electrical resistivity, soil imagery, acoustics, and visible and near-infrared spectroscopy. The DSC System integrates the DSC Probe, DSC software (v2023.10), and deployment equipment components to sense soil characteristics at a high vertical spatial resolution (mm scale) along in situ soil profiles up to a depth of 120 cm in about 60 s. The DSC Probe in situ proximal data are harmonized into a data cube providing vertical high-density knowledge associated with physical-chemical-biological soil conditions. In contrast, conventional ex situ soil samples derived from soil cores, soil pits, or surface samples analyzed using laboratory and other methods are bound by a substantially coarser spatial resolution and multiple compounding errors. Our objective was to investigate the effects of the mismatched scale between high-resolution in situ proximal sensor data and coarser-resolution ex situ soil laboratory measurements to develop soil prediction models. Our study was conducted in central California soil in almond orchards. We collected DSC sensor data and spatially co-located soil cores that were sliced into narrow layers for laboratory-based soil measurements. Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) cross-validation was used to compare the results of testing four data integration methods. Method A reduced the high-resolution sensor data to discrete values paired with layer-based soil laboratory measurements. Method B used stochastic distributions of sensor data paired with layer-based soil laboratory measurements. Method C allocated the same soil analytical data to each one of the high-resolution multi-sensor data within a soil layer. Method D linked the high-density multi-sensor soil data directly to crop responses (crop performance and behavior metrics), bypassing costly laboratory soil analysis. Overall, the soil models derived from Method C outperformed Methods A and B. Soil predictions derived using Method D were the most cost-effective for directly assessing soil-crop relationships, making this method well suited for industrial-scale precision agriculture applications.

AB Emerging technologies are increasingly employed in environmental citizen science projects. This integration offers benefits and opportunities for scientists and participants alike. Citizen science can support large-scale, long-term monitoring of species occurrences, behaviour and interactions. At the same time, technologies can foster participant engagement, regardless of pre-existing taxonomic expertise or experience, and permit new types of data to be collected. Yet, technologies may also create challenges by potentially increasing financial costs, necessitating technological expertise or demanding training of participants. Technology could also reduce people's direct involvement and engagement with nature. In this perspective, we discuss how current technologies have spurred an increase in citizen science projects and how the implementation of emerging technologies in citizen science may enhance scientific impact and public engagement. We show how technology can act as (i) a facilitator of current citizen science and monitoring efforts, (ii) an enabler of new research opportunities, and (iii) a transformer of science, policy and public participation, but could also become (iv) an inhibitor of participation, equity and scientific rigour. Technology is developing fast and promises to provide many exciting opportunities for citizen science and insect monitoring, but while we seize these opportunities, we must remain vigilant against potential risks.This article is part of the theme issue 'Towards a toolkit for global insect biodiversity monitoring'.

AB Objectives To perform a meta-analysis of the diagnostic performance of learning (ML) algorithms (conventional and deep learning algorithms) for the classification of malignant versus benign focal liver lesions (FLLs) on US and CEUS.
   Methods Available databases were searched for relevant published studies through September 2022. Studies met eligibility criteria if they evaluate the diagnostic performance of ML for the classification of malignant and benign focal liver lesions on US and CEUS. The pooled per-lesion sensitivities and specificities for each modality with 95% confidence intervals were calculated.
   Results A total of 8 studies on US, 11 on CEUS, and 1 study evaluating both methods met the inclusion criteria with a total of 34,245 FLLs evaluated. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of ML for the malignancy classification of FLLs were 81.7% (95% CI, 77.2-85.4%) and 84.8% (95% CI, 76.0-90.8%) for US, compared to 87.1% ( 95% CI, 81.8-91.0%) and 87.0% (95% CI, 83.1-90.1%) for CEUS. In the subgroup analysis of studies that evaluated deep learning algorithms, the sensitivity and specificity of CEUS (n = 4) increased to 92.4% (95% CI, 88.5-95.0%) and 88.2% (95% CI, 81.1-92.9%).
   Conclusions The diagnostic performance of ML algorithms for the malignant classification of FLLs was high for both US and CEUS with overall similar sensitivity and specificity. The similar performance of US may be related to the higher prevalence of DL models in that group.

AB Background: The prediction of posttransplant health outcomes for pediatric heart transplantation is critical for risk stratification and high-quality posttransplant care. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the use of machine learning (ML) models to predict rejection and mortality for pediatric heart transplant recipients. Methods: Various ML models were used to predict rejection and mortality at 1, 3, and 5 years after transplantation in pediatric heart transplant recipients using United Network for Organ Sharing data from 1987 to 2019. The variables used for predicting posttransplant outcomes included donor and recipient as well as medical and social factors. We evaluated 7 ML models-extreme multilayer perceptron, and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost)-as well as a deep learning model with 2 hidden layers with 100 neurons and a rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function followed by batch normalization for each and a classification head with a softmax activation function. We used 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance. Shapley additive explanations Results: RF and AdaBoost models were the best-performing algorithms for different prediction windows across outcomes. RF outperformed other ML algorithms in predicting 5 of the 6 outcomes (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] 0.664 and 0.706 for 1-year and 3-year rejection, respectively, and AUROC 0.697, 0.758, and 0.763 for 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year mortality, respectively). AdaBoost achieved the best performance for prediction of 5-year rejection (AUROC 0.705). Conclusions: This study demonstrates the comparative utility of ML approaches for modeling posttransplant health outcomes using registry data. ML approaches can identify unique risk factors and their complex relationship with outcomes, thereby identifying patients considered to be at risk and informing the transplant community about the potential of these innovative approaches to improve pediatric care after heart transplantation. Future studies are required to translate the information derived from prediction models to optimize counseling, clinical care, and decision-making within pediatric organ transplant centers.

TI Characterizing orthodontic tooth movement in real time using dental

ID FORCE MAGNITUDE; ANCHORAGE
AB ObjectivesThis pilot study aimed to quantify the magnitude and type of tooth movement occurring in short time intervals within the regular monthly orthodontic visits for patients with fixed appliances and undergoing maxillary canine retraction. Additionally, this pilot study aimed to provide a descriptive evaluation for the accuracy and reliability of the Dental Monitoring (DM)-captured scans to those of an iTero digital scans in an extraction space closure model.Settings and Sample Population3D intraoral photographic scans (DM) for 12 patients with maxillary first premolar extractions in a single-centre academic institution.Materials and MethodsTwelve patients treated with fixed appliances and undergoing space closure for maxillary premolar extraction(s) were included. Nickel-titanium (200 g) closing coil springs were used for canine retraction. At initiation of space closure (T1), iTero scans were acquired, and patients were instructed to take DM scans every 4-5 days until their next visit in 4-5 weeks (T2). At T2, a final iTero scan in addition to a DM scan was taken. The number of patients who did the scans regularly as instructed declined as time elapsed. Stereolithography (STL) files generated from the DM scans were superimposed with the STL files from the iTero scans using GOM Inspect software to determine the accuracy of the DM 3D models. To assess rate, type and direction of tooth movement, each of the 3D image STL files generated from the DM scans, taken every 4-5 days by each patient, was superimposed on the previously captured scan. The rate of tooth movement for the maxillary molars and canines was calculated in the 3 planes of space (X, Y, Z) at each time point, until the end of the experiment.ResultsPreliminary results indicated that the maxillary canines appeared to be displaced the greatest amount in the first 4-5 days with initial distolateral movement. As time elapsed, the rate of tooth movement decreased, and the tooth started moving distolingually.ConclusionsDental monitoring software provides a high-tech platform to monitor tooth movement in a 'real-time' approach. Accuracy of the photographic scans in relationship to the intraoral scans appears promising. There seems to be some evidence that the greatest amount of movement occurs initially in the first few days after activation, dropping thereafter to become a slower constant rate of tooth movement.

AB The Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) Think Tank XII was held on August 21st to 23rd. This year we showcased groundbreaking advancements in neuromodulation technology, focusing heavily on the novel uses of existing technology as well as next-generation technology. Our keynote speaker shared the vision of using neuro artificial intelligence to predict depression using brain electrophysiology. Innovative applications are currently being explored in stroke, disorders of consciousness, and sleep, while established treatments for movement disorders like Parkinson's disease are being refined with adaptive stimulation. Neuromodulation is solidifying its role in treating psychiatric disorders such as depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder, particularly for patients with treatment-resistant symptoms. We estimate that 300,000 leads have been implanted to date for neurologic and neuropsychiatric indications. Magnetoencephalography has provided insights into the post-DBS physiological changes. The field is also critically examining the ethical implications of implants, considering the long-term impacts on clinicians, patients, and manufacturers.

AB Variation in nuclear size and shape is an important criterion of malignancy for many tumor types; however, categorical estimates by pathologists have poor reproducibility. Measurements of nuclear characteristics can improve reproducibility, but current manual methods are time-consuming. The aim of this study was to explore the limitations of estimates and develop alternative morphometric solutions for canine cutaneous mast cell tumors (ccMCTs). We assessed the following nuclear evaluation methods for accuracy, reproducibility, and prognostic utility: (1) anisokaryosis estimates by 11 pathologists; (2) gold standard manual morphometry of at least 100 nuclei; (3) practicable manual morphometry with stratified sampling of 12 nuclei by 9 pathologists; and (4) automated morphometry using deep learning-based segmentation. The study included 96 ccMCTs with available outcome information. Inter-rater reproducibility of anisokaryosis estimates was low (k = 0.226), whereas it was good (intraclass correlation = 0.654) for practicable morphometry of the standard deviation (SD) of nuclear size. As compared with gold standard manual morphometry (area under the ROC curve [AUC] = 0.839, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.701-0.977), the prognostic value (tumor-specific survival) of SDs of nuclear area for practicable manual morphometry and automated morphometry were high with an AUC of 0.868 (95% CI = 0.737-0.991) and 0.943 (95% CI = 0.889-0.996), respectively. This study supports the use of manual morphometry with stratified sampling of 12 nuclei and algorithmic morphometry to overcome the poor reproducibility of estimates. Further studies are needed to validate our findings, determine inter-algorithmic reproducibility and algorithmic robustness, and explore tumor heterogeneity of nuclear features in entire tumor sections.

AB Advances in artificial intelligence for computer vision hold great promise for increasing the scales at which ecological systems can be studied. The distribution and behavior of individuals is central to ecology, and computer vision using deep neural networks can learn to detect individual objects in imagery. However, developing supervised models for ecological monitoring is challenging because it requires large amounts of human-labeled training data, requires advanced technical expertise and computational infrastructure, and is prone to overfitting. This limits application across space and time. One solution is developing generalized models that can be applied across species and ecosystems. Using over 250,000 annotations from 13 projects from around the world, we develop a general bird detection model that achieves over 65% recall and 50% precision on novel aerial data without any local training despite differences in species, habitat, and imaging methodology. Fine-tuning this model with only 1000 local annotations increases these values to an average of 84% recall and 69% precision by building on the general features learned from other data sources. Retraining from the general model improves local predictions even when moderately large annotation sets are available and makes model training faster and more stable. Our results demonstrate that general models for detecting broad classes of organisms using airborne imagery are achievable. These models can reduce the effort, expertise, and computational resources necessary for automating the detection of individual organisms across large scales, helping to transform the scale of data collection in ecology and the questions that can be addressed.

AB Animal re-identification remains a challenging problem due to the cost of tagging systems and the difficulty of permanently attaching a physical marker to some animals, such as sea stars. Due to these challenges, photo identification is a good fit to solve this problem whether evaluated by humans or through machine learning. Accurate machine learning methods are an improvement over manual identification as they are capable of evaluating a large number of images automatically and recent advances have reduced the need for large training datasets. This study aimed to create an accurate, robust, general purpose machine learning framework for individual animal re-identification using images both from publicly available data as well as two groups of sea stars of different species under human care. Open-source code was provided to accelerate work in this space. Images of two species of sea star (Asterias rubens and Anthenea australiae) were taken using a consumer-grade smartphone camera and used as original datasets to train a machine learning model to re-identify an individual animal using few examples. The model's performance was evaluated on these original sea star datasets which contained between 39-54 individuals and 983-1204 images, as well as using six publicly available re-identification datasets for tigers, beef cattle noses, chimpanzee faces, zebras, giraffes and ringed seals ranging between 45-2056 individuals and 829-6770 images. Using time aware-splits, which are a data splitting technique ensuring that the model only sees an individual's images from a previous collection event during training to avoid information leaking, the model achieved high (>99%) individual re-identification mean average precision for the top prediction (mAP@1) for the two species of sea stars. The re-identification mAP@1 for the mammalian datasets was more variable, ranging from 83% to >99%. However, this model outperformed published state-of-the-art re-identification results for the publicly available datasets. The reported approach for animal re-identification is generalizable, with the same machine learning framework achieving good performance in two distinct species of sea stars with different physical attributes, as well as seven different mammalian species. This demonstrates that this methodology can be applied to nearly any species where individual re-identification is required. This study presents a precise, practical, non-invasive approach to animal re-identification using only basic image collection methods.

AB Background Brain metastasis invasion pattern (BMIP) is an emerging biomarker associated with recurrence-free and overall survival in patients, and differential response to therapy in preclinical models. Currently, BMIP can only be determined from the histopathological examination of surgical specimens, precluding its use as a biomarker prior to therapy initiation. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of machine learning (ML) approaches to develop a noninvasive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based biomarker for BMIP determination.Methods From an initial cohort of 329 patients, a subset of 132 patients met the inclusion criteria for this retrospective study. We evaluated the ability of an expert neuroradiologist to reliably predict BMIP. Thereafter, the dataset was randomly divided into training/validation (80% of cases) and test subsets (20% of cases). The ground truth for BMIP was the histopathologic evaluation of resected specimens. Following MRI sequence co-registration, advanced feature extraction techniques deriving hand-crafted radiomic features with traditional ML classifiers and convolution-based deep learning (CDL) models were trained and evaluated. Different ML approaches were used individually or using ensembling techniques to determine the model with the best performance for BMIP prediction.Results Expert evaluation of brain MRI scans could not reliably predict BMIP, with an accuracy of 44%-59% depending on the semantic feature used. Among the different ML and CDL models evaluated, the best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 85% and an F1 score of 90%.Conclusions ML approaches can effectively predict BMIP, representing a noninvasive MRI-based approach to guide the management of patients with brain metastases.

ID MORTALITY
AB PURPOSELung cancer screening (LCS) has the potential to reduce mortality and detect lung cancer at its early stages, but the high false-positive rate associated with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) for LCS acts as a barrier to its widespread adoption. This study aims to develop computable phenotype (CP) algorithms on the basis of electronic health records (EHRs) to identify individual's eligibility for LCS, thereby enhancing LCS utilization in real-world settings.MATERIALS AND METHODSThe study cohort included 5,778 individuals who underwent LDCT for LCS from 2012 to 2022, as recorded in the University of Florida Health Integrated Data Repository. CP rules derived from LCS guidelines were used to identify potential candidates, incorporating both structured EHR and clinical notes analyzed via natural language processing. We then conducted manual reviews of 453 randomly selected charts to refine and validate these rules, assessing CP performance using metrics, for example, F1 score, specificity, and sensitivity.RESULTSWe developed an optimal CP rule that integrates both structured and unstructured data, adhering to the US Preventive Services Task Force 2013 and 2020 guidelines. This rule focuses on age (55-80 years for 2013 and 50-80 years for 2020), smoking status (current, former, and others), and pack-years (>= 30 for 2013 and >= 20 for 2020), achieving F1 scores of 0.75 and 0.84 for the respective guidelines. Including unstructured data improved the F1 score performance by up to 9.2% for 2013 and 12.9% for 2020, compared with using structured data alone.CONCLUSIONOur findings underscore the critical need for improved documentation of smoking information in EHRs, demonstrate the value of artificial intelligence techniques in enhancing CP performance, and confirm the effectiveness of EHR-based CP in identifying LCS-eligible individuals. This supports its potential to aid clinical decision making and optimize patient care.

AB Decision-making in congenital cardiac care, although sometimes appearing simple, may prove challenging due to lack of data, uncertainty about outcomes, underlying heuristics, and potential biases in how we reach decisions. We report on the decision-making complexities and uncertainty in management of five commonly encountered congenital cardiac problems: indications for and timing of treatment of subaortic stenosis, closure or observation of small ventricular septal defects, management of new-onset aortic regurgitation in ventricular septal defect, management of anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery in an asymptomatic patient, and indications for operating on a single anomalously draining pulmonary vein. The strategy underpinning each lesion and the indications for and against intervention are outlined. Areas of uncertainty are clearly delineated. Even in the presence of "simple" congenital cardiac lesions, uncertainty exists in decision-making. Awareness and acceptance of uncertainty is first required to facilitate efforts at mitigation. Strategies to circumvent uncertainty in these scenarios include greater availability of evidence-based medicine, larger datasets, standardised clinical assessment and management protocols, and potentially the incorporation of artificial intelligence into the decision-making process.

AB Agricultural ecosystem formation and evolution depend on interactions and communication between multiple organisms. Within this context, communication occurs between microbes, plants, and insects, often involving the release and perception of a wide range of chemical cues. Unraveling how this information is coded and interpreted is critical to expanding our understanding of how agricultural ecosystems function in terms of competition and cooperation. Investigations examining dual interactions (e.g. plant-microbe, insect-microbe, and insect-plant) have resolved some basic components of this communication. However, there is a need for systematically examining multitrophic interactions that occur simultaneously between microorganisms, insects, and plants. A more thorough understanding of these multitrophic interactions has been made possible by recent advancements in the study of such ecological interactions, which are based on a variety of contemporary technologies such as artificial intelligence sensors, multi-omics, metabarcoding, and others. Frequently, these developments have led to the discovery of startling examples of each member manipulating the other. Here, we review recent advances in the understanding of bottom-up chemical communication between microorganisms, plants, and insects, and their consequences. We discuss the components of these "chemo-languages" and how they modify outcomes of multi-species interactions across trophic levels. Further, we suggest prospects for translating the current basic understanding of multitrophic interactions into strategies that could be applied in agricultural ecosystems to increase food safety and security.

AB Background: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among women in the US, predominantly due to ischemic heart disease (IHD). There is a notable deficiency in therapies tailored for IHD in women, who often present with variable symptoms that delay diagnosis and treatment. In many cases, coronary angiography does not reveal obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) despite increased risk for major adverse cardiac events (MACE) compared with sex and age-matched asymptomatic cohorts. Objectives: The Women's IschemiA TRial to Reduce Events in Nonobstructive CAD (WARRIOR) evaluates intensive medical treatment for women with Ischemia with No Obstructive Coronary Arteries (INOCA). The QUIET WARRIOR sub-study aims to improve predictive tools for adverse outcomes by detailed analysis of Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA) data and biorepository samples. These data will also uncover pathophysiological mechanisms associated with angina and MACE, improving predictive tools for symptomatic women with INOCA. Methods: This ancillary study will analyze CCTA images from 600 WARRIOR subjects. It will assess clinical, social, and coronary artery variables, including plaque characteristics and markers of inflammation. Advanced imaging techniques and machine-learning models will be employed to quantify plaque features and predict clinical outcomes. Expected results: The study aims to elucidate associations between CCTA-derived plaque characteristics, ischemic symptoms, and MACE. Anticipated findings include correlations of specific plaque attributes with angina severity and novel insights into inflammatory markers. Socioeconomic variables will also be examined for their impact on cardiovascular risk. Conclusion: The QUIET WARRIOR sub-study will advance the understanding of INOCA in women, integrating clinical, imaging, and socioeconomic data to enhance risk prediction and guide personalized therapeutic strategies. This research will address critical gaps in managing nonobstructive CAD, promoting more equitable cardiovascular care.

AB Neuropsychological assessment using the Boston Process Approach (BPA) suggests that an analysis of the strategy or the process by which tasks and neuropsychological tests are completed, and the errors made during test completion convey much information regarding underlying brain and cognition and are as important as overall summary scores. Research over the last several decades employing an analysis of process and errors has been able to dissociate between dementia patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia associated with MRI-determined white matter alterations, and Parkinson's disease; and between mild cognitive impairment subtypes. Nonetheless, BPA methods can be labor intensive to deploy. However, the recent availability of digital platforms for neuropsychological test administration and scoring now enables reliable, rapid, and objective data collection. Further, digital technology can quantify highly nuanced data previously unobtainable to define neurocognitive constructs with high accuracy. In this paper, a brief review of the BPA is provided. Studies that demonstrate how digital technology translates BPA into specific neurocognitive constructs using the Clock Drawing Test, Backward Digit Span Test, and a Digital Pointing Span Test are described. Implications for using data driven artificial intelligence-supported analytic approaches enabling the creation of more sensitive and specific detection/diagnostic algorithms for putative neurodegenerative illness are also discussed.

AB This manifesto critically examines the unfolding integration of Generative AI (GenAI), chatbots, and algorithms into higher education, using a collective and thoughtful approach to navigate the future of teaching and learning. GenAI, while celebrated for its potential to personalize learning, enhance efficiency, and expand educational accessibility, is far from a neutral tool. Algorithms now shape human interaction, communication, and content creation, raising profound questions about human agency and biases and values embedded in their designs. As GenAI continues to evolve, we face critical challenges in maintaining human oversight, safeguarding equity, and facilitating meaningful, authentic learning experiences. This manifesto emphasizes that GenAI is not ideologically and culturally neutral. Instead, it reflects worldviews that can reinforce existing biases and marginalize diverse voices. Furthermore, as the use of GenAI reshapes education, it risks eroding essential human elements- creativity, critical thinking, and empathy-and could displace meaningful human interactions with algorithmic solutions. This manifesto calls for robust, evidence-based research and conscious decision-making to ensure that GenAI enhances, rather than diminishes, human agency and ethical responsibility in education.

ID PERFORMANCE
AB Background: The elastic scattering spectroscopy (ESS) device (DermaSensor Inc., Miami, FL) is a noninvasive, painless, adjunctive tool for skin cancer detection. Objectives: To investigate the performance of the ESS device in the detection of melanoma. Methods: A prospective, investigator-blinded, multicenter study was conducted at 8 United States (US) and 2 Australian sites. All eligible skin lesions were clinically concerning for melanoma, examined with the ESS device, subsequently biopsied according to dermatologists' standard of care, and evaluated with histopathology. A total of 311 participants with 440 lesions were enrolled, including 44 melanomas (63.6% in situ and 36.4% invasive) and 44 severely dysplastic nevi. Results: The observed sensitivity of the ESS device for melanoma detection was 95.5% (95% CI, 84.5% to 98.8%, 42 of 44 melanomas), and the observed specificity was 32.5% (95% CI, 27.2% to 38.3%). The positive and negative predictive values were 16.0% and 98.1%, respectively. Limitations: The device was tested in a high-risk population with lesions selected for biopsy based on clinical and dermoscopic assessments of board-certified dermatologists. Most enrolled lesions were pigmented. Conclusion: The ESS device's high sensitivity and NPV for the detection of melanoma suggest the device may be a useful adjunctive, point-of-care tool for melanoma detection.

AB Background: A common terminology for diagnosis is critically important for clinical communication, education, research and artificial intelligence. Prevailing lexicons are limited in fully representing skin neoplasms. Objectives: To achieve expert consensus on diagnostic terms for skin neoplasms and their hierarchical mapping. Methods: Diagnostic terms were extracted from textbooks, publications and extant diagnostic codes. Terms were hierarchically mapped to super-categories (e.g. 'benign') and cellular/tissue-differentiation categories (e.g. 'melanocytic'), and appended with pertinent-modifiers and synonyms. These terms were evaluated using a modified-Delphi consensus approach. Experts from the International-Skin-Imaging-Collaboration (ISIC) were surveyed on agreement with terms and their hierarchical mapping; they could suggest modifying, deleting or adding terms. Consensus threshold was >75% for the initial rounds and >50% for the final round. Results: Eighteen experts completed all Delphi rounds. Of 379 terms, 356 (94%) reached consensus in round one. Eleven of 226 (5%) benign-category terms, 6/140 (4%) malignant-category terms and 6/13 (46%) indeterminate-category terms did not reach initial agreement. Following three rounds, final consensus consisted of 362 terms mapped to 3 super-categories and 41 cellular/tissue-differentiation categories. Conclusions: We have created, agreed upon, and made public a taxonomy for skin neoplasms and their hierarchical mapping. Further study will be needed to evaluate the utility and completeness of the lexicon.

ID COMPUTABLE PHENOTYPE
AB Background: Pediatric asthma is a heterogeneous disease; however, current characterizations of its subtypes are limited. Machine learning (ML) methods are well-suited for identifying subtypes. In particular, deep neural networks can learn patient representations by leveraging longitudinal information captured in electronic health records (EHRs) while considering future outcomes. However, the traditional approach for subtype analysis requires large amounts of EHR data, which may contain protected health information causing potential concerns regarding patient privacy. Federated learning is the key technology to address privacy concerns while preserving the accuracy and performance of ML algorithms. Federated learning could enable multisite development and implementation of ML algorithms to facilitate the translation of artificial intelligence into clinical practice. Objective: The aim of this study is to develop a research protocol for implementation of federated ML across a large clinical research network to identify and discover pediatric asthma subtypes and their progression over time. Methods: This mixed methods study uses data and clinicians from the OneFlorida+ clinical research network, which is a large regional network covering linked and longitudinal patient-level real-world data (RWD) of over 20 million patients from Florida, Georgia, and Alabama in the United States. To characterize the subtypes, we will use OneFlorida+ data from 2011 to 2023 and develop a research-grade pediatric asthma computable phenotype and clinical natural language processing pipeline to identify pediatric patients with asthma aged 2-18 years. We will then apply federated learning to characterize pediatric asthma subtypes and their temporal progression. Using the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services framework, we will conduct focus groups with practicing pediatric asthma clinicians within the OneFlorida+ network to investigate the clinical utility of the subtypes. With a user-centered design, we will create prototypes to visualize the subtypes in the EHR to best assist with the clinical management of children with asthma. Results: OneFlorida+ data from 2011 to 2023 have been collected for 411,628 patients aged 2-18 years along with 11,156,148 clinical notes. We expect to complete the computable phenotyping within the first year of the project, followed by subtyping during the second and third years, and then will perform the focus groups and establish the user-centered design in the fourth and fifth years of the project. Conclusions: Pediatric asthma subtypes incorporating RWD from diverse populations could improve patient outcomes by moving the field closer to precision pediatric asthma care. Our privacy-preserving federated learning methodology and qualitative implementation work will address several challenges of applying ML to large, multicenter RWD data.

AB Natural disturbances like hurricanes can cause extensive disorder in forest structure, composition, and succession. Consequently, ecological, social, and economic alterations may occur. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and deep learning have been used for estimating forest attributes with high accuracy, but to date, no study has combined both TLS and deep learning for assessing the impact of hurricane disturbance at the individual tree level. Here, we aim to assess the capability of TLS and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) combined for classifying post-Hurricane Michael damage severity at the individual tree level in a pine-dominated forest ecosystem in the Florida Panhandle, Southern U.S. We assessed the combined impact of using either binary-color or multicolored-by-height TLS-derived 2D images along with six CNN architectures (Densenet201, EfficientNet_b7, Inception_v3, Res-net152v2, VGG16, and a simple CNN). The confusion matrices used for assessing the overall accuracy were symmetric in all six CNNs and 2D image variants tested with overall accuracy ranging from 73% to 92%. We found higher F-1 scores when classifying trees with damage severity varying from extremely leaning, trunk snapped, stem breakage, and uprooted compared to trees that were undamaged or slightly leaning (<45 degrees). Moreover, we found higher accuracies when using VGG16 combined with multicolored-by-height TLS-derived 2D images compared with other methods. Our findings demonstrate the high capability of combining TLS with CNNs for classifying post-hurricane damage severity at the individual tree level in pine forest ecosystems. As part of this work, we developed a new open-source R package (rTLsDeep) and implemented all methods tested herein. We hope that the promising results and the rTLsDeep R package developed in this study for classifying post-hurricane damage severity at the individual tree level will stimulate further research and applications not just in pine forests but in other forest types in hurricane-prone regions.

AB Introduction: Variations in skin tone can significantly alter the appearance of symptoms such as rashes or bruises. Unfortunately, previous works utilizing Augmented Reality (AR) in simulating visual symptoms have often failed to consider this critical aspect, potentially leading to inadequate training and education. This study seeks to address this gap by integrating generative artificial intelligence (AI) into the AR filter design process.Methods: We conducted a 2 x 5 within-subjects study with second-year nursing students (N = 117) from the University of Florida. The study manipulated two factors: symptom generation style and skin tone. Symptom generation style was manipulated using a filter based on a real symptom image or a filter based on a computer-generated symptom image. Skin tone variations were created by applying AR filters to computer-generated images of faces with five skin tones ranging from light to dark. To control for factors like lighting or 3D tracking, 101 pre-generated images were created for each condition, representing a range of filter transparency levels (0-100). Participants used visual analog scales on a computer screen to adjust the symptom transparency in the images until they observed image changes and distinct symptom patterns. Participants also rated the realism of each condition and provided feedback on how the symptom style and skin tone impacted their perceptions.Results: Students rated the symptoms displayed by the computer-generated AR filters as marginally more realistic than those displayed by the real image AR filters. However, students identified symptoms earlier with the real-image filters. Additionally, SET-M and Theory of Planned Behavior questions indicate that the activity increased students' feelings of confidence and self-efficacy. Finally, we found that similar to the real world, where symptoms on dark skin tones are identified at later stages of development, students identified symptoms at later stages as skin tone darkened regardless of cue type.Conclusion: This work implemented a novel approach to develop AR filters that display time-based visual cues on diverse skin tones. Additionally, this work provides evidence-based recommendations on how and when generative AI-based AR filters can be effectively used in healthcare education.

AB Advanced sensing technologies and deep learning models are needed for automatic recognition of pathogens to protect trees in orchards. This study developed a fire blight disease detection and infected area segmentation system using image processing and deep learning approaches to automate the detection process in a complex apple orchard environment for site-specific management. Two types of images were acquired: multispectral images from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) using a multispectral camera and red-greenblue (RGB) images from the ground using two different cameras. Multispectral images were preprocessed and used for image feature analysis by calculating vegetation indices, including excessive blue (ExB), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), red-edge normalized difference vegetation index (RENDVI), modified ratio vegetation index (RVI), and triangular blueness index (TBI). Vegetation indices were calculated from a total of 60 multispectral images (30 heathy and 30 fire blight infected). Results showed that RVI was most sensitive to fire blight infection among the six indices. A support vector machine model was used to classify unhealthy tree canopies. A Mask Region-Convolutional Neural Network (Mask R-CNN) based deep learning model was developed from RGB infected images. A total of 880 images were used for training, and 220 images were used for validation. Another 110 images were used for testing the trained Mask R-CNN model. A precision of 92.8 % and recall of 91.2 % were obtained by detecting the infected canopies using a ResNet-101 backbone and intersection over union (IoU) threshold of 0.7. The high precision demonstrates the effectiveness of Mask R-CNN for the identification and segmentation of fire blight infection in images taken in complex orchard conditions. These results prove the potential of this non-invasive sensing method in detecting disease in commercial fruit production for site-specific infected canopies removing.

AB How to deliver best care in various clinical settings remains a vexing problem. All pertinent healthcare-related questions have not, cannot, and will not be addressable with costly time- and resource-consuming controlled clinical trials. At present, evidence-based guidelines can address only a small fraction of the types of care that clinicians deliver. Furthermore, underserved areas rarely can access state-of-the-art evidence-based guidelines in real-time, and often lack the wherewithal to implement advanced guidelines. Care providers in such settings frequently do not have sufficient training to undertake advanced guideline implementation. Nevertheless, in advanced modern healthcare delivery environments, use of eActions (validated clinical decision support systems) could help overcome the cognitive limitations of overburdened clinicians. Widespread use of eActions will require surmounting current healthcare technical and cultural barriers and installing clinical evidence/data curation systems. The authors expect that increased numbers of evidence-based guidelines will result from future comparative effectiveness clinical research carried out during routine healthcare delivery within learning healthcare systems.

AB Personalized medicine tailors therapies, disease prevention, and health maintenance to the indi-vidual, with pharmacogenomics serving as a key tool to improve outcomes and prevent adverse effects. Advances in genomics have transformed pharmacogenetics, tradi-tionally focused on single gene-drug pairs, into pharmaco-genomics, encompassing all "-omics" fields (e.g., proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and metagenomics). This review summarizes basic genomics principles relevant to translation into therapies, assessing pharmacogenomics' central role in converging diverse elements of personal-ized medicine. We discuss genetic variations in pharma-cogenes (drug-metabolizing enzymes, drug transporters, and receptors), their clinical relevance as biomarkers, and the legacy of decades of research in pharmacoge-netics. All types of therapies, including proteins, nucleic acids, viruses, cells, genes, and irradiation, can benefit from genomics, expanding the role of pharmacogenom-ics across medicine. Food and Drug Administration ap-provals of personalized therapeutics involving biomarkers increase rapidly, demonstrating the growing impact of pharmacogenomics. A beacon for all therapeutic ap-proaches, molecularly targeted cancer therapies high-light trends in drug discovery and clinical applications. To account for human complexity, multicomponent bio-marker panels encompassing genetic, personal, and envi-ronmental factors can guide diagnosis and therapies, increasingly involving artificial intelligence to cope with extreme data complexities. However, clinical application encounters substantial hurdles, such as unknown valid-ity across ethnic groups, underlying bias in health care, and real-world validation. This review address the underlying science and technologies germane to phar-macogenomics and personalized medicine, integrated with economic, ethical, and regulatory issues, provid-ing insights into the current status and future direction of health care.Significance Statement--Personalized medicine aims to optimize health care for the individual pa-tients with use of predictive biomarkers to improve out-comes and prevent adverse effects. Pharmacogenomics drives biomarker discovery and guides the develop-ment of targeted therapeutics. This review addresses basic principles and current trends in pharmacoge-nomics, with large-scale data repositories accelerating medical advances. The impact of pharmacogenomics is discussed, along with hurdles impeding broad clini-cal implementation, in the context of clinical care, ethics, economics, and regulatory affairs.

   DIAGNOSIS
AB Background: Cardiologs has developed the first electrocardiogram (ECG) algorithm that uses a deep neural network (DNN) for full 12-lead ECG analysis, including rhythm, QRS and ST-T-U waves. We compared the accuracy of the first version of Cardiologs (R) DNN algorithm to the Mortara/Veritas (R) conventional algorithm in emergency department (ED) ECG5.
   Methods: Individual ECG diagnoses were prospectively mapped to one of 16 pre-specified groups of ECG diagnoses, which were further classified as "major" ECG abnormality or not. Automated interpretations were compared to blinded experts'. The primary outcome was the performance of the algorithms in finding at least one "major" abnormality. The secondary outcome was the proportion of all ECGs for which all groups were identified, with no false negative or false positive groups ("accurate ECG interpretation"). Additionally, we measured sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) for any abnormal group.
   Results: Cardiologs (R) vs. Veritas (R) accuracy for finding a major abnormality was 92.2% vs. 87.2% (p < 0.0001), with comparable sensitivity (88.7% vs. 92.0%, p = 0.086), improved specificity (94.0% vs. 84.7%, p < 0.0001) and improved positive predictive value (PPV 88.2% vs. 75.4%, p < 0.0001). Cardiologs (R) had accurate ECG interpretation for 72.0% (95% CI: 69.6-74.2) of ECGs vs. 59.8% (57.3-62.3) for Veritas (R) (P< 0.0001). Sensitivity for any abnormal group for Cardiologs (R) and Veritas (R), respectively, was 69.6% (95CI 66.7-723) vs. 68.3% (95CI 65.3-71.1) (NS). Positive Predictive Value was 74.0% (71.1-76.7) for Cardiologs (R) vs. 56.5% (53.7-593) for Veritas (R) (P < 0.0001).
   Conclusion: Cardiologs' DNN was more accurate and specific in identifying ECG5 with at least one major abnormal group. It had a significantly higher rate of accurate ECG interpretation, with similar sensitivity and higher PPV. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Background Accurate and repeatable measurement of high-grade glioma (HGG) enhancing (Enh.) and T2/FLAIR hyperintensity/edema (Ed.) is required for monitoring treatment response. 3D measurements can be used to inform the modified Response Assessment in Neuro-oncology criteria. We aim to develop an HGG volumetric measurement and visualization AI algorithm that is generalizable and repeatable. Methods A single 3D-Convoluted Neural Network, NS-HGlio, to analyze HGG on MRIs using 5-fold cross validation was developed using retrospective (557 MRIs), multicentre (38 sites) and multivendor (32 scanners) dataset divided into training (70%), validation (20%), and testing (10%). Six neuroradiologists created the ground truth (GT). Additional Internal validation (IV, three institutions) using 70 MRIs, and External validation (EV, single institution) using 40 MRIs through measuring the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of Enh., Ed. ,and Enh. + Ed. (WholeLesion/WL) tumor tissue and repeatability testing on 14 subjects from the TCIA MGH-QIN-GBM dataset using volume correlations between timepoints were performed. Results IV Preoperative median DSC Enh. 0.89 (SD 0.11), Ed. 0.88 (0.28), WL 0.88 (0.11). EV Preoperative median DSC Enh. 0.82 (0.09), Ed. 0.83 (0.11), WL 0.86 (0.06). IV Postoperative median DSC Enh. 0.77 (SD 0.20), Ed 0.78. (SD 0.09), WL 0.78 (SD 0.11). EV Postoperative median DSC Enh. 0.75 (0.21), Ed 0.74 (0.12), WL 0.79 (0.07). Repeatability testing; Intraclass Correlation Coefficient of 0.95 Enh. and 0.92 Ed. Conclusion NS-HGlio is accurate, repeatable, and generalizable. The output can be used for visualization, documentation, treatment response monitoring, radiation planning, intra-operative targeting, and estimation of Residual Tumor Volume among others.

AB A workshop on research gaps and opportunities for Precision Medicine in Pancreatic Disease was sponsored by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Kidney Diseases on July 24, 2019, in Pittsburgh. The workshop included an overview lecture on precision medicine in cancer and 4 sessions: (1) general considerations for the application of bioinformatics and artificial intelligence; (2) omics, the combination of risk factors and biomarkers; (3) precision imaging; and (4) gaps, barriers, and needs to move from precision to personalized medicine for pancreatic disease. Current precision medicine approaches and tools were reviewed, and participants identified knowledge gaps and research needs that hinder bringing precision medicine to pancreatic diseases. Most critical were (a) multicenter efforts to collect large-scale patient data sets from multiple data streams in the context of environmental and social factors; (b) new information systems that can collect, annotate, and quantify data to inform disease mechanisms; (c) novel prospective clinical trial designs to test and improve therapies; and (d) a framework for measuring and assessing the value of proposed approaches to the health care system. With these advances, precision medicine can identify patients early in the course of their pancreatic disease and prevent progression to chronic or fatal illness.

TI Evaluation of federated learning variations for COVID-19 diagnosis using

AB Objective Federated learning (FL) allows multiple distributed data holders to collaboratively learn a shared model without data sharing. However, individual health system data are heterogeneous. "Personalized" FL variations have been developed to counter data heterogeneity, but few have been evaluated using real-world healthcare data. The purpose of this study is to investigate the performance of a single-site versus a 3-client federated model using a previously described Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) diagnostic model. Additionally, to investigate the effect of system heterogeneity, we evaluate the performance of 4 FL variations. Materials and methods We leverage a FL healthcare collaborative including data from 5 international healthcare systems (US and Europe) encompassing 42 hospitals. We implemented a COVID-19 computer vision diagnosis system using the Federated Averaging (FedAvg) algorithm implemented on Clara Train SDK 4.0. To study the effect of data heterogeneity, training data was pooled from 3 systems locally and federation was simulated. We compared a centralized/pooled model, versus FedAvg, and 3 personalized FL variations (FedProx, FedBN, and FedAMP). Results We observed comparable model performance with respect to internal validation (local model: AUROC 0.94 vs FedAvg: 0.95, P = .5) and improved model generalizability with the FedAvg model (P < .05). When investigating the effects of model heterogeneity, we observed poor performance with FedAvg on internal validation as compared to personalized FL algorithms. FedAvg did have improved generalizability compared to personalized FL algorithms. On average, FedBN had the best rank performance on internal and external validation. Conclusion FedAvg can significantly improve the generalization of the model compared to other personalization FL algorithms; however, at the cost of poor internal validity. Personalized FL may offer an opportunity to develop both internal and externally validated algorithms.

AB Motion-activated cameras ("camera traps") are increasingly used in ecological and management studies for remotely observing wildlife and are amongst the most powerful tools for wildlife research. However, studies involving camera traps result in millions of images that need to be analysed, typically by visually observing each image, in order to extract data that can be used in ecological analyses. We trained machine learning models using convolutional neural networks with the ResNet-18 architecture and 3,367,383 images to automatically classify wildlife species from camera trap images obtained from five states across the United States. We tested our model on an independent subset of images not seen during training from the United States and on an out-of-sample (or "out-of-distribution" in the machine learning literature) dataset of ungulate images from Canada. We also tested the ability of our model to distinguish empty images from those with animals in another out-of-sample dataset from Tanzania, containing a faunal community that was novel to the model. The trained model classified approximately 2,000 images per minute on a laptop computer with 16 gigabytes of RAM. The trained model achieved 98% accuracy at identifying species in the United States, the highest accuracy of such a model to date. Out-of-sample validation from Canada achieved 82% accuracy and correctly identified 94% of images containing an animal in the dataset from Tanzania. We provide an r package (Machine Learning for Wildlife Image Classification) that allows the users to (a) use the trained model presented here and (b) train their own model using classified images of wildlife from their studies. The use of machine learning to rapidly and accurately classify wildlife in camera trap images can facilitate non-invasive sampling designs in ecological studies by reducing the burden of manually analysing images. Our r package makes these methods accessible to ecologists.

   health record; deep learning; artificial intelligence
ID ACUTE PHYSIOLOGY; SCORE
AB Acuity assessments are vital for timely interventions and fair resource allocation in critical care settings. Conventional acuity scoring systems heavily depend on subjective patient assessments, leaving room for implicit bias and errors. These assessments are often manual, time-consuming, intermittent, and challenging to interpret accurately, especially for healthcare providers. This risk of bias and error is likely most pronounced in time-constrained and high-stakes environments, such as critical care settings. Furthermore, such scores do not incorporate other information, such as patients' mobility level, which can indicate recovery or deterioration in the intensive care unit (ICU), especially at a granular level. We hypothesized that wearable sensor data could assist in assessing patient acuity granularly, especially in conjunction with clinical data from electronic health records (EHR). In this prospective study, we evaluated the impact of integrating mobility data collected from wrist-worn accelerometers with clinical data obtained from EHR for estimating acuity. Accelerometry data were collected from 87 patients wearing accelerometers on their wrists in an academic hospital setting. The data was evaluated using five deep neural network models: VGG, ResNet, MobileNet, SqueezeNet, and a custom Transformer network. These models outperformed a rule-based clinical score (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, SOFA) used as a baseline when predicting acuity state (for ground truth we labeled as unstable patients if they needed life-supporting therapies, and as stable otherwise), particularly regarding the precision, sensitivity, and F1 score. The results demonstrate that integrating accelerometer data with demographics and clinical variables improves predictive performance compared to traditional scoring systems in healthcare. Deep learning models consistently outperformed the SOFA score baseline across various scenarios, showing notable enhancements in metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC), precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. The most comprehensive scenario, leveraging accelerometer, demographics, and clinical data, achieved the highest AUC of 0.73, compared to 0.53 when using SOFA score as the baseline, with significant improvements in precision (0.80 vs. 0.23), specificity (0.79 vs. 0.73), and F1 score (0.77 vs. 0.66). This study demonstrates a novel approach beyond the simplistic differentiation between stable and unstable conditions. By incorporating mobility and comprehensive patient information, we distinguish between these states in critically ill patients and capture essential nuances in physiology and functional status. Unlike rudimentary definitions, such as equating low blood pressure with instability, our methodology delves deeper, offering a more holistic understanding and potentially valuable insights for acuity assessment.

AB Magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a powerful, non-invasive, quantitative imaging technique that allows for the measurement of brain metabolites that has demonstrated utility in diagnosing and characterizing a broad range of neurological diseases. Its impact, however, has been limited due to small sample sizes and methodological variability in addition to intrinsic limitations of the method itself such as its sensitivity to motion. The lack of standardization from a data acquisition and data processing perspective makes it difficult to pool multiple studies and/or conduct multisite studies that are necessary for supporting clinically relevant findings. Based on the experience of the ENIGMA MRS work group and a review of the literature, this manuscript provides an overview of the current state of MRS data harmonization. Key factors that need to be taken into consideration when conducting both retrospective and prospective studies are described. These include (1) MRS acquisition issues such as pulse sequence, RF and B0 calibrations, echo time, and SNR; (2) data processing issues such as pre-processing steps, modeling, and quantitation; and (3) biological factors such as voxel location, age, sex, and pathology. Various approaches to MRS data harmonization are then described including meta-analysis, mega-analysis, linear modeling, ComBat and artificial intelligence approaches. The goal is to provide both novice and experienced readers with the necessary knowledge for conducting MRS data harmonization studies.

ID PROTEINS
AB Glycosylation is the most common form of post-translational modification of proteins, critically affecting their structure and function. Using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry for high-resolution site-specific quantification of glycopeptides coupled with high-throughput artificial intelligence-powered data processing, we analyzed differential protein glycoisoform distributions of 597 abundant serum glycopeptides and nonglycosylated peptides in 50 individuals who had been seriously ill with COVID-19 and in 22 individuals who had recovered after an asymptomatic course of COVID-19. As additional comparison reference phenotypes, we included 12 individuals with a history of infection with a common cold coronavirus, 16 patients with bacterial sepsis, and 15 healthy subjects without history of coronavirus exposure. We found statistically significant differences, at FDR < 0.05, for normalized abundances of 374 of the 597 peptides and glycopeptides interrogated between symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. Similar statistically significant differences were seen when comparing symptomatic COVID-19 patients to healthy controls (350 differentially abundant peptides and glycopeptides) and common cold coronavirus seropositive subjects (353 differentially abundant peptides and glycopeptides). Among healthy controls and sepsis patients, 326 peptides and glycopeptides were found to be differentially abundant, of which 277 overlapped with biomarkers that showed differential expression between symptomatic COVID-19 cases and healthy controls. Among symptomatic COVID-19 cases and sepsis patients, 101 glycopeptide and peptide biomarkers were found to be statistically significantly abundant. Using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, we found specific glycoprotein profiles to be strongly predictive of symptomatic COVID-19 infection. LASSO-regularized multivariable logistic regression and K-means clustering yielded accuracies of 100% in an independent test set and of 96% overall, respectively. Our findings are consistent with the interpretation that a majority of glycoprotein modifications observed which are shared among symptomatic COVID-19 and sepsis patients likely represent a generic consequence of a severe systemic immune and inflammatory state. However, there are glycoisoform changes that are specific and particular to severe COVID-19 infection. These may be representative of either COVID-19-specific consequences or susceptibility to or predisposition for a severe course of the disease. Our findings support the potential value of glycoproteomic biomarkers in the biomedical understanding and, potentially, the clinical management of serious acute infectious conditions.

AB Background: Inpatient falls, many resulting in injury or death, are a serious problem in hospital settings. Existing falls risk assessment tools, such as the Morse Fall Scale, give a risk score based on a set of factors, but don't necessarily signal which factors are most important for predicting falls. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods provide an opportunity to improve predictive performance while also identifying the most important risk factors associated with hospital-acquired falls. We can glean insight into these risk factors by applying classification tree, bagging, random forest, and adaptive boosting methods applied to Electronic Health Record (EHR) data.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to use tree-based machine learning methods to determine the most important predictors of inpatient falls, while also validating each via cross-validation.
   Materials and methods: A case-control study was designed using EHR and electronic administrative data collected between January 1, 2013 to October 31, 2013 in 14 medical surgical units. The data contained 38 predictor variables which comprised of patient characteristics, admission information, assessment information, clinical data, and organizational characteristics. Classification tree, bagging, random forest, and adaptive boosting methods were used to identify the most important factors of inpatient fall-risk through variable importance measures. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve were computed via ten-fold cross validation and compared via pairwise t-tests. These methods were also compared to a univariate logistic regression of the Morse Fall Scale total score.
   Results: In terms of AUROC, bagging (0.89), random forest (0.90), and boosting (0.89) all outperformed the Morse Fall Scale (0.86) and the classification tree (0.85), but no differences were measured between bagging, random forest, and adaptive boosting, at a p-value of 0.05. History of Falls, Age, Morse Fall Scale total score, quality of gait, unit type, mental status, and number of high fall risk increasing drugs (FRIDs) were considered the most important features for predicting inpatient fall risk.
   Conclusions: Machine learning methods have the potential to identify the most relevant and novel factors for the detection of hospitalized patients at risk of falling, which would improve the quality of patient care, and to more fully support healthcare provider and organizational leadership decision-making. Nurses would be able to enhance their judgement to caring for patients at risk for falls. Our study may also serve as a reference for the development of AI-based prediction models of other iatrogenic conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the importance of patient, clinical, and organizational features based on the use of AI approaches.

AB Purpose. The present scoping review aims to describe and analyze available clinical data on the most commonly reported risk prediction indices in vascular surgery for perioperative mortality, with a particular focus on ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA). Materials and Methods. A scoping review following the PRISMA Protocols Extension for Scoping Reviews was performed. Available full-text studies published in English in PubMed, Cochrane and EMBASE databases (last queried, 30 March 2023) were systematically reviewed and analyzed. The Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) framework used to construct the search strings was the following: in patients with aortic pathologies, in particular rAAA (population), undergoing open or endovascular surgery (intervention), what different risk prediction models exist (comparison), and how well do they predict post-operative mortality (outcomes)? Results. The literature search and screening of all relevant abstracts revealed a total of 56 studies in the final qualitative synthesis. The main findings of the scoping review, grouped by the risk score that was investigated in the original studies, were synthetized without performing any formal meta-analysis. A total of nine risk scores for major vascular surgery or elective AAA, and 10 scores focusing on rAAA, were identified. Whilst there were several validation studies suggesting that most risk scores performed adequately in the setting of rAAA, none reached 100% accuracy. The Glasgow aneurysm score, ERAS and Vancouver score risk scores were more frequently included in validation studies and were more often used in secondary studies. Unfortunately, the published literature presents a heterogenicity of results in the validation studies comparing the different risk scores. To date, no risk score has been endorsed by any of the vascular surgery societies. Conclusions. The use of risk scores in any complex surgery can have multiple advantages, especially when dealing with emergent cases, since they can inform perioperative decision making, patient and family discussions, and post hoc case-mix adjustments. Although a variety of different rAAA risk prediction tools have been published to date, none are superior to others based on this review. The heterogeneity of the variables used in the different scores impairs comparative analysis which represents a major limitation to understanding which risk score may be the "best" in contemporary practice. Future developments in artificial intelligence may further assist surgical decision making in predicting post-operative adverse events.

TI Peer review of GPT-4 technical report and systems card
SO PLOS DIGITAL HEALTH
LA English
DT Review
AB The study provides a comprehensive review of OpenAI's Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) technical report, with an emphasis on applications in high-risk settings like healthcare. A diverse team, including experts in artificial intelligence (AI), natural language processing, public health, law, policy, social science, healthcare research, and bioethics, analyzed the report against established peer review guidelines. The GPT-4 report shows a significant commitment to transparent AI research, particularly in creating a systems card for risk assessment and mitigation. However, it reveals limitations such as restricted access to training data, inadequate confidence and uncertainty estimations, and concerns over privacy and intellectual property rights. Key strengths identified include the considerable time and economic investment in transparent AI research and the creation of a comprehensive systems card. On the other hand, the lack of clarity in training processes and data raises concerns about encoded biases and interests in GPT-4. The report also lacks confidence and uncertainty estimations, crucial in high-risk areas like healthcare, and fails to address potential privacy and intellectual property issues. Furthermore, this study emphasizes the need for diverse, global involvement in developing and evaluating large language models (LLMs) to ensure broad societal benefits and mitigate risks. The paper presents recommendations such as improving data transparency, developing accountability frameworks, establishing confidence standards for LLM outputs in high-risk settings, and enhancing industry research review processes. It concludes that while GPT-4's report is a step towards open discussions on LLMs, more extensive interdisciplinary reviews are essential for addressing bias, harm, and risk concerns, especially in high-risk domains. The review aims to expand the understanding of LLMs in general and highlights the need for new reflection forms on how LLMs are reviewed, the data required for effective evaluation, and addressing critical issues like bias and risk.

AB Diarrheal diseases lead to an estimated 1.3 million deaths each year, with the majority of those deaths occurring in patients over five years of age. As the severity of diarrheal disease can vary widely, accurately assessing dehydration status remains the most critical step in acute diarrhea management. The objective of this study is to empirically derive clinical diagnostic models for assessing dehydration severity in patients over five years with acute diarrhea in low resource settings. We enrolled a random sample of patients over five years with acute diarrhea presenting to the icddr,b Dhaka Hospital. Two blinded nurses independently assessed patients for symptoms/signs of dehydration on arrival. Afterward, consecutive weights were obtained to determine the percent weight change with rehydration, our criterion standard for dehydration severity. Full and simplified ordinal logistic regression models were derived to predict the outcome of none (<3%), some (3-9%), or severe (>9%) dehydration. The reliability and accuracy of each model were assessed. Bootstrapping was used to correct for over-optimism and compare each model's performance to the current World Health Organization (WHO) algorithm. 2,172 patients were enrolled, of which 2,139 (98.5%) had complete data for analysis. The Inter-Class Correlation Coefficient (reliability) was 0.90 (95% CI = 0.87, 0.91) for the full model and 0.82 (95% CI = 0.77, 0.86) for the simplified model. The area under the Receiver-Operator Characteristic curve (accuracy) for severe dehydration was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.76-0.82) for the full model and 0.73 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.76) for the simplified model. The accuracy for both the full and simplified models were significantly better than the WHO algorithm (p<0.001). This is the first study to empirically derive clinical diagnostic models for dehydration severity in patients over five years. Once prospectively validated, the models may improve management of patients with acute diarrhea in low resource settings.
   Author summary
   More than a million adults and older children die each year from diarrhea, with the vast majority living in low- and middle-income countries. Accurately assessing hydration status remains the most critical step in caring for these patients. While most patients with diarrhea can be managed safely at home, a small proportion will have severe dehydration and require intravenous fluid in a hospital setting to prevent organ damage and death. Despite dramatic improvements in diarrhea care around the world over the past several decades, there are still no evidence-based tools that doctors and nurses in low resource settings can use to determine a patient's hydration status. Our study collected data on more than two thousand patients with acute diarrhea over the age of five years at Dhaka Hospital in Bangladesh. Using artificial intelligence techniques, we developed two new clinical diagnostic tools that can accurately and reliably predict the severity of dehydration in patients with diarrhea, which we will incorporate into a simple mobile phone application for use by doctors and nurses in low resource settings. Once validated, these new tools could improve care for patients with acute diarrhea worldwide.

AB Simple Summary Canine soft-tissue sarcomas are a group of tumours that arise from the skin and subcutaneous connective tissue. The most common method used to predict the behaviour of these tumours is grading. The grading system used for soft-tissue sarcomas is derived from a combined score calculated by evaluating the mitotic count, percentage of tumour necrosis and degree of cellular differentiation. However, these parameters are highly subjective and a high inter-observer variability has been reported in grading these tumours, which can result in complications regarding treatment plans. Manual identification of areas of necrosis is a time-consuming task that is prone to observer error. Artificial-intelligence algorithms and, in particular, machine learning, can help improve grading by automatically detecting regions of necrosis. The aim of this study was to differentiate image regions in order to automatically identify tumour necrosis in digitised canine soft-tissue sarcoma slides. This method showed an accuracy of 92.7% which represents the number of correctly classified data instances over the total number of data instances. Therefore, the proposed method is a promising tool to minimise human error in the evaluation of necrosis in soft-tissue sarcomas, and hence increase the efficiency and accuracy of histopathological grading of canine soft-tissue sarcomas. The definitive diagnosis of canine soft-tissue sarcomas (STSs) is based on histological assessment of formalin-fixed tissues. Assessment of parameters, such as degree of differentiation, necrosis score and mitotic score, give rise to a final tumour grade, which is important in determining prognosis and subsequent treatment modalities. However, grading discrepancies are reported to occur in human and canine STSs, which can result in complications regarding treatment plans. The introduction of digital pathology has the potential to help improve STS grading via automated determination of the presence and extent of necrosis. The detected necrotic regions can be factored in the grading scheme or excluded before analysing the remaining tissue. Here we describe a method to detect tumour necrosis in histopathological whole-slide images (WSIs) of STSs using machine learning. Annotated areas of necrosis were extracted from WSIs and the patches containing necrotic tissue fed into a pre-trained DenseNet161 convolutional neural network (CNN) for training, testing and validation. The proposed CNN architecture reported favourable results, with an overall validation accuracy of 92.7% for necrosis detection which represents the number of correctly classified data instances over the total number of data instances. The proposed method, when vigorously validated represents a promising tool to assist pathologists in evaluating necrosis in canine STS tumours, by increasing efficiency, accuracy and reducing inter-rater variation.

AB Background: The application of large language models across commercial and consumer contexts has grown exponentially in recent years. However, a gap exists in the literature on how large language models can support nursing practice, education, and research. This study aimed to synthesize the existing literature on current and potential uses of large language models across the nursing profession. Methods: A rapid review of the literature, guided by Cochrane rapid review methodology and PRISMA reporting standards, was conducted. An expert health librarian assisted in developing broad inclusion criteria to account for the emerging nature of literature related to large language models. Three electronic databases (i.e., PubMed, CINAHL, and Embase) were searched to identify relevant literature in August 2023. Articles that discussed the development, use, and application of large language models within nursing were included for analysis. Results: The literature search identified a total of 2028 articles that met the inclusion criteria. After systematically reviewing abstracts, titles, and full texts, 30 articles were included in the final analysis. Nearly all (93 %; n = 28) of the included articles used ChatGPT as an example, and subsequently discussed the use and value of large language models in nursing education (47 %; n = 14), clinical practice (40 %; n = 12), and research (10 %; n = 3). While the most common assessment of large language models was conducted by human evaluation (26.7 %; n = 8), this analysis also identified common limitations of large language models in nursing, including lack of systematic evaluation, as well as other ethical and legal considerations. Discussion: This is the first review to summarize contemporary literature on current and potential uses of large language models in nursing practice, education, and research. Although there are significant opportunities to apply large language models, the use and adoption of these models within nursing have elicited a series of challenges, such as ethical issues related to bias, misuse, and plagiarism. Conclusion: Given the relative novelty of large language models, ongoing efforts to develop and implement meaningful assessments, evaluations, standards, and guidelines for applying large language models in nursing are recommended to ensure appropriate, accurate, and safe use. Future research along with clinical and educational partnerships is needed to enhance understanding and application of large language models in nursing and healthcare. (c) 2024 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Introduction: A rapid and reliable neuropsychological protocol is essential for the efficient assessment of neurocognitive constructs related to emergent neurodegenerative diseases. We developed an AI-assisted, digitally administered/scored neuropsychological protocol that can be remotely administered in similar to 10 min. This protocol assesses the requisite neurocognitive constructs associated with emergent neurodegenerative illnesses.
   Methods: The protocol was administered to 77 ambulatory care/memory clinic patients (56.40% women; 88.50% Caucasian). The protocol includes a 6-word version of the Philadelphia (repeatable) Verbal Learning Test [P(r)VLT], three trials of 5 digits backward from the Backwards Digit Span Test (BDST), and the "animal" fluency test. The protocol provides a comprehensive set of traditional "core" measures that are typically obtained through paper-and-pencil tests (i.e., serial list learning, immediate and delayed free recall, recognition hits, percent correct serial order backward digit span, and "animal" fluency output). Additionally, the protocol includes variables that quantify errors and detail the processes used in administering the tests. It also features two separate, norm-referenced summary scores specifically designed to measure executive control and memory.
   Results: Using four core measures, we used cluster analysis to classify participants into four groups: cognitively unimpaired (CU; n = 23), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 17), dysexecutive MCI (n = 23), and dementia (n = 14). Subsequent analyses of error and process variables operationally defined key features of amnesia (i.e., rapid forgetting, extra-list intrusions, profligate responding to recognition foils); key features underlying reduced executive abilities (i.e., BDST items and dysexecutive errors); and the strength of the semantic association between successive responses on the "animal" fluency test. Executive and memory index scores effectively distinguished between all four groups. There was over 90% agreement between how cluster analysis of digitally obtained measures classified patients compared to classification using a traditional comprehensive neuropsychological protocol. The correlations between digitally obtained outcome variables and analogous paper/pencil measures were robust.
   Discussion: The digitally administered protocol demonstrated a capacity to identify patterns of impaired performance and classification similar to those observed with standard paper/pencil neuropsychological tests. The inclusion of both core measures and detailed error/process variables suggests that this protocol can detect subtle, nuanced signs of early emergent neurodegenerative illness efficiently and comprehensively.

AB Simple Summary We investigated a new method for diagnosing and predicting outcomes in canine pulmonary carcinoma. We developed a deep learning-based algorithm that accurately detects tumor nuclei and subsequently measures size and shape parameters. The variation in nuclear size and shape (nuclear pleomorphism) is a crucial malignancy criterion used in the current grading system for canine pulmonary carcinoma. Pathologists currently evaluate it and classify it according to a three-tier system. Manual morphometry is a more objective approach where tumor nuclei are individually encircled and analyzed. This task can be easily performed by an algorithm. Our algorithm's accuracy in correctly detecting and segmenting tumor nuclei was considered good when compared to manual morphometry. By comparing automated morphometry with conventional prognostic tests, such as pathologists' estimates, mitotic count, histological grading, and clinical staging, we found that our approach was equally accurate in terms of prognostic value. The algorithm's advantage lies in its high reproducibility and efficiency. Automated evaluation of nuclear pleomorphism can enhance the efficiency and reliability of canine pulmonary carcinoma diagnosis and grading, effectively addressing issues of inter-observer reproducibility. However, further optimization of the algorithm and validation with a larger study group is necessary to confirm our findings.Abstract The integration of deep learning-based tools into diagnostic workflows is increasingly prevalent due to their efficiency and reproducibility in various settings. We investigated the utility of automated nuclear morphometry for assessing nuclear pleomorphism (NP), a criterion of malignancy in the current grading system in canine pulmonary carcinoma (cPC), and its prognostic implications. We developed a deep learning-based algorithm for evaluating NP (variation in size, i.e., anisokaryosis and/or shape) using a segmentation model. Its performance was evaluated on 46 cPC cases with comprehensive follow-up data regarding its accuracy in nuclear segmentation and its prognostic ability. Its assessment of NP was compared to manual morphometry and established prognostic tests (pathologists' NP estimates (n = 11), mitotic count, histological grading, and TNM-stage). The standard deviation (SD) of the nuclear area, indicative of anisokaryosis, exhibited good discriminatory ability for tumor-specific survival, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.80 and a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.38. The algorithm achieved values comparable to manual morphometry. In contrast, the pathologists' estimates of anisokaryosis resulted in HR values ranging from 0.86 to 34.8, with slight inter-observer reproducibility (k = 0.204). Other conventional tests had no significant prognostic value in our study cohort. Fully automated morphometry promises a time-efficient and reproducible assessment of NP with a high prognostic value. Further refinement of the algorithm, particularly to address undersegmentation, and application to a larger study population are required.

AB Conservation programs need improved tools to measure the recovery of animal diversity across restoration gradients. We used soundscapes and expert identifications of bird species to calculate niche position (i.e., mean of environmental conditions across all areas a species occupies) and niche breadth (i.e., the standard deviation of the species distribution) along a recovery gradient; from agriculture to early (up to 20 yrs) and late (up to 38 yrs) recovery, to old-growth forests. Our survey included 323 bird species and was conducted in 66 plots in the lowland Chocoan tropical rainforest in Ecuador where less than 11% of the forest remains intact, and large areas are currently undergoing regeneration post-abandonment. First, we validated our niche metrics by contrasting them against independent global categories of forest density dependency. We then explained the niche metrics of the bird species with different ecological traits, gathered from the literature, reflecting species-specific primary diet, morphology and distribution, and accounting for the phylogenetic relatedness of species. Finally, we explored the phylogenetic signal present in bird species' ecological traits and recovery niche metrics. Niche position and breadth across the recovery gradient closely followed global categories of forest density dependency. However, our approach provided a more fine-scaled sorting of bird species in forest plots categorized as late recovery and old-growth. Granivorous birds occupied niche positions in active cacao and pasture plots and were replaced by frugivorous birds in older regeneration plots. Along the recovery gradient, tail length and handwing index decreased with niche position, supporting previous observations that birds in old-growth forests are less mobile. Birds in old-growth forests had smaller global distribution ranges than birds in agricultural plots. Finally, the latitudinal distribution of birds in the study area averaged south of the equator, with birds in oldgrowth plots averaging latitudinal centroids in wet forests north of the equator, whereas birds in agriculture plots averaged latitudinal centroids further south of the country, towards the dry and open Tumbesian forest. Frugivores, invertivores and vertivores had broader niche breadths, but these decreased (marginally) with tail length. We suggest these recovery niche metrics as a potentially powerful tool for the rapid assessment of the recovery process, which might support conservation strategies such as biodiversity credits, compensation payments, and strategic land purchases. With the increasing availability of information-intensive models for bird species identification, such as deep learning artificial intelligence, our new niche metrics open the avenue for rapid assessment of tropical biodiversity and new conservation areas at larger scales.

AB Aims Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is associated with a substantial rate of adverse events. We sought to design a machine learning (ML)-based model to predict the risk of in-hospital death and to perform a clustering of TTS patients to identify different risk profiles.Methods and results A ridge logistic regression-based ML model for predicting in-hospital death was developed on 3482 TTS patients from the International Takotsubo (InterTAK) Registry, randomly split in a train and an internal validation cohort (75% and 25% of the sample size, respectively) and evaluated in an external validation cohort (1037 patients). Thirty-one clinically relevant variables were included in the prediction model. Model performance represented the primary endpoint and was assessed according to area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity. As secondary endpoint, a K-medoids clustering algorithm was designed to stratify patients into phenotypic groups based on the 10 most relevant features emerging from the main model. The overall incidence of in-hospital death was 5.2%. The InterTAK-ML model showed an AUC of 0.89 (0.85-0.92), a sensitivity of 0.85 (0.78-0.95) and a specificity of 0.76 (0.74-0.79) in the internal validation cohort and an AUC of 0.82 (0.73-0.91), a sensitivity of 0.74 (0.61-0.87) and a specificity of 0.79 (0.77-0.81) in the external cohort for in-hospital death prediction. By exploiting the 10 variables showing the highest feature importance, TTS patients were clustered into six groups associated with different risks of in-hospital death (28.8% vs. 15.5% vs. 5.4% vs. 1.0.8% vs. 0.5%) which were consistent also in the external cohort.Conclusion A ML-based approach for the identification of TTS patients at risk of adverse short-term prognosis is feasible and effective. The InterTAK-ML model showed unprecedented discriminative capability for the prediction of in-hospital death.

AB OBJECTIVES:This study aimed to establish a set of guiding principles for data sharing and harmonization in critical care, focusing on the use of real-world data (RWD) and real-world evidence (RWE) to improve patient outcomes and research efficacy. The principles were developed through a systematic literature review and a modified Delphi process, with the goal of enhancing data accessibility, standardization, and interoperability across critical care settings.DATA SOURCES:Data sources included a comprehensive search of peer-reviewed literature, specifically studies related to the use of RWD and RWE in healthcare, guidelines, best practices, and recommendations on data sharing and harmonization. A total of 8150 articles were initially identified through databases such as MEDLINE and Web of Science, with 257 studies meeting inclusion criteria.STUDY SELECTION:Inclusion criteria focused on publications discussing health-related informatics, recommendations for RWD/RWE usage, data sharing, and harmonization principles. Exclusion criteria ruled out non-human studies, case studies, conference abstracts, and articles published before 2013, as well as those not available in English.DATA EXTRACTION:From the 257 selected studies, 322 statements were extracted. After removing irrelevant definitions and off-topic content, 232 statements underwent content validation and thematic analysis. These statements were then consolidated into 24 candidate guiding principles after rigorous review and consensus-building among the expert panel.DATA SYNTHESIS:A three-phase modified Delphi process was employed, involving a conceptualization group, a review group, and a Delphi group. In phase 1, experts identified key themes and search terms for the systematic review. Phase 2 involved validating and refining the prospective guiding principles, while phase 3 employed a Delphi panel to rate principles on acceptability, importance, and feasibility. This process resulted in 24 guiding principles, with high consensus achieved in rounds 2 and 3 on their relevance and applicability.CONCLUSIONS:The systematic review and Delphi process resulted in 24 guiding principles to improve data sharing and harmonization in critical care. These principles address challenges across the data lifecycle, including generation, storage, access, and usage of RWD and RWE. This framework is designed to promote more effective and equitable data practices, with relevance for the development of artificial intelligence-based decision support tools and clinical research. The principles are intended to guide the responsible use of data science in critical care, with emphasis on ethics and equity, while acknowledging the variability of resources across settings.

AB Plants, and the biological systems around them, are key to the future health of the planet and its inhabitants. The Plant Science Decadal Vision 2020-2030 frames our ability to perform vital and far-reaching research in plant systems sciences, essential to how we value participants and apply emerging technologies. We outline a comprehensive vision for addressing some of our most pressing global problems through discovery, practical applications, and education. The Decadal Vision was developed by the participants at the Plant Summit 2019, a community event organized by the Plant Science Research Network. The Decadal Vision describes a holistic vision for the next decade of plant science that blends recommendations for research, people, and technology. Going beyond discoveries and applications, we, the plant science community, must implement bold, innovative changes to research cultures and training paradigms in this era of automation, virtualization, and the looming shadow of climate change. Our vision and hopes for the next decade are encapsulated in the phrase reimagining the potential of plants for a healthy and sustainable future. The Decadal Vision recognizes the vital intersection of human and scientific elements and demands an integrated implementation of strategies for research (Goals 1-4), people (Goals 5 and 6), and technology (Goals 7 and 8). This report is intended to help inspire and guide the research community, scientific societies, federal funding agencies, private philanthropies, corporations, educators, entrepreneurs, and early career researchers over the next 10 years. The research encompass experimental and computational approaches to understanding and predicting ecosystem behavior; novel production systems for food, feed, and fiber with greater crop diversity, efficiency, productivity, and resilience that improve ecosystem health; approaches to realize the potential for advances in nutrition, discovery and engineering of plant-based medicines, and "green infrastructure." Launching the Transparent Plant will use experimental and computational approaches to break down the phytobiome into a "parts store" that supports tinkering and supports query, prediction, and rapid-response problem solving. Equity, diversity, and inclusion are indispensable cornerstones of realizing our vision. We make recommendations around funding and systems that support customized professional development. Plant systems are frequently taken for granted therefore we make recommendations to improve plant awareness and community science programs to increase understanding of scientific research. We prioritize emerging technologies, focusing on non-invasive imaging, sensors, and plug-and-play portable lab technologies, coupled with enabling computational advances. Plant systems science will benefit from data management and future advances in automation, machine learning, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence-assisted data integration, pattern identification, and decision making. Implementation of this vision will transform plant systems science and ripple outwards through society and across the globe. Beyond deepening our biological understanding, we envision entirely new applications. We further anticipate a wave of diversification of plant systems practitioners while stimulating community engagement, underpinning increasing entrepreneurship.
   This surge of engagement and knowledge will help satisfy and stoke people's natural curiosity about the future, and their desire to prepare for it, as they seek fuller information about food, health, climate and ecological systems.
