AB Background Spirometry is conventionally used to diagnose airway diseases in children with sickle cell disease (C-SCD). However, spirometry is difficult for younger children to perform, is effort dependent, and it provides limited information on respiratory mechanics. Impulse oscillometry (IOS) is an effort-independent pulmonary function test (PFT), which measures total airway resistance (R5Hz) and reactance (AX). IOS could be advantageous without certain limitations of spirometry. Aim To compare the accuracy of IOS vs spirometry in making the diagnosis of asthma and assessing age-related pulmonary changes in C-SCD. Study design Retrospective chart review. Subject selection Fifty-six C-SCD and thirty-six controls (asthmatics without SCD) followed at Penn State with PFTs obtained during the initial pulmonary evaluation. Methodology We grouped C-SCD into asthmatics and non-asthmatics based on pre-referral diagnosis and compared PFTs between two groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses and machine learning tools (XGBoost and artificial neural network) were used to rank the spirometry and IOS measures based on their ability to predict a diagnosis of asthma. Robust linear regression was used to analyze association among height/age with various PFT measures. Results Both ROC and XGBoost indicated that FEF25-75%, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity, and R5Hz(%) were the top three predictors for asthma diagnosis. R5Hz(%) and AX had superior bronchodilator response (BDR) than FEV1. IOS parameters had significant association with height/age in C-SCD (possibly due to the stiff lungs) but not in controls. Conclusion IOS had advantages over spirometry in C-SCD because it is feasible in early childhood, provides insights into the pulmonary mechanics, and is more sensitive to detect BDR.

TI Self-supervised generative models for crystal structures
SO ISCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB Inspired by advancements in natural language processing, we utilize self-supervised learning and an equivariant graph neural network to develop a unified platform for training generative models capable of generating inorganic crystal structures, as well as efficiently adapting to downstream tasks in material property prediction. To mitigate the challenge of evaluating the reliability of generated structures during training, we employ a generative adversarial network (GAN) with its discriminator being a cost-effective reliability evaluator, significantly enhancing model performance. We demonstrate the utility of our model in optimizing crystal structures under predefined conditions. Without external properties acquired experimentally or numerically, our model further displays its capability to help understand inorganic crystal formation by grouping chemically similar elements. This paper extends an invitation to further explore the scientific understanding of material structures through generative models, offering a fresh perspective on the scope and efficacy of machine learning in material science.

TI Mood Themes the World
SO AM JOURNAL OF ART AND MEDIA STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
DE apparatus; theme; mood; artificial intelligence; electracy
AB Apparatus theory (a hybrid of McLuhan and Derrida) hypothesizes that a civiliza-tion of electracy (the digital apparatus) must learn how to thrive in a lifeworld in which the visceral faculty of appetite is hegemonic. The dominant axis of behavior today is fantasy -anxi-ety (attraction/repulsion). We propose that world theming has created a vernacular discourse that may be raised to a second power of expression as vehicle of visceral intelligence. The immediate claim is that theming in digital media augments mood (ambiance) into a power of imagination, just as dialectic in writing augmented logic into a power of reason. Fantasy today is persuasive, just as logical entailment is (was) in the rational order of literacy. Decisions de-termining real events today are being made in worlds of mood.World theming is evident in the vernacular art practices arising from recent advanc-es in artificial intelligence. The availability of commodity GPUs, along with public access to advanced research via GitHub, Kaggle, Hugging Face, and the proliferation of forums such as Reddit, Discord, YouTube, and others, has resulted in a renaissance of public engagement with technology-informed creative practice. In addition, the general availability of Google's previously internal-only development tool, Colab, in late 2017 provided access to cloud-based GPUs and storage systems accessible only to data scientists and academics. In early 2021 Ryan Murdock released a Colab notebook called Big Sleep that combined Ope-nAI's recently published Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) with BigGAN. This model is a paradigmatic example of our observation. By early 2022, multiple derivations of this process incorporated alternative image generation techniques. This paper will demonstrate how the fundamental basis of these methods are distinctly electrate in their use of 'theme' and emphasis on 'mood' in world-building, including a case-study animation called Dissipative Off-ramps.

AB Considering the advancement of generative artificial intelligence and the mental health challenges faced by hospitality employees, this study proposes and tests a scenario of counseling hospitality employees using conversational AI chatbots in a mobile app. Survey data were collected from 553 hospitality employees in Japan. Findings reveal that employees' expected psychological safety of AI chatbots can be improved by AI chatbots' cuteness of appearance and emotional capability, and their expected service quality in using AI chatbots can be enhanced by cuteness of appearance, emotional capability, and psychological safety. The service quality of AI chatbots then causes their use intention, which then strengthens their willingness to recommend and help colleagues' usage of AI chatbots for counseling. Moreover, employees' general app fatigue can moderate the effects of AI chatbots' cuteness of appearance on psychological safety and service quality. This study offers valuable practical implications for developing conversational AI chatbots for hospitality employees.

AB The traditional approach to curating and disseminating information about agricultural injuries relies heavily on manual input and review, resulting in a labor-intensive process. While the unstructured nature of the material traditionally requires human reviewers, the recent proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced the potential for automation. This study investigates the feasibility and implications of filling the role of a human reviewer with an LLM in analyzing information about agricultural injuries from news articles and investigation reports. Multiple language models were tested for accuracy in extracting relevant incident and victim information, and these models include OpenAI's ChatGPT 3.5 and 4 and an open-source fine-tuned version of Llama 2. To measure accuracy, each LLM was given prompts to gather relevant data from a set of randomly selected online news articles already cataloged by human reviewers, such as the use of drugs or alcohol, time of day, or other information about the victim(s). Results showed that the fine-tuned Llama2 was the most proficient model with an average accuracy of 93% and some categories reaching 100%. ChatGPT-4 also performed well with around 90% accuracy. Additionally, we found that the fine-tuned Llama2 model was somewhat proficient in coding injuries using the OIICS classification scheme, achieving 48% accuracy when predicting the first digit. Though none of the models are perfectly accurate, the methodology and results prove that LLMs are promising in streamlining workflows in order to reduce human and financial resources and increase the efficiency of data analysis.

AB The availability of accurate reference evapotranspiration (ETo) data is crucial for developing decision support systems for optimal water resource management. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of three empirical models (Hargreaves-Samani (HS), Priestly-Taylor (PT), and Turc (TU)) and three machine learning models (Multiple linear regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Network (NN)) in estimating daily ETo compared to the Penman-Monteith FAO-56 (PM) model. Long-term data from 42 weather stations in Florida were used. Moreover, the effect of ETo model selection on sweet corn irrigation water use was investigated by integrating simulated ETo data from empirical and ML models using the Decision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer (DSSAT) model at two locations (Citra and Homestead) in Florida. Furthermore, a linear bias correction calibration technique was employed to improve the performance of empirical models. Results were consistent in that the NN and RF models outperformed the empirical models. The empirical models tended to underestimate and overestimate small and high daily ETo values, respectively, with the HS model exhibiting the least accuracy. However, calibrated PT and TU models performed comparably to the ML models. Results also revealed that using an inappropriate ETo model could lead to over-irrigation by up to 54 mm during a single crop season. Overall, ML models have proven reliable alternatives to the PM model, especially in regions with access to long-term data due to their site-independent performance. In areas without long-term data for ML model training and testing, calibrating empirical models is viable, but site-specific calibration is needed. It is important to highlight that distinct plant species exhibit varying transpiration characteristics and, consequently, have different water requirements. These differences play a pivotal role in shaping the overall impact of ETo models on crop water use.

AB Establishing maximum-residue limits (MRLs) for veterinary medicine helps to protect the human food supply. Guidelines for establishing MRLs are outlined by regulatory authorities that drug sponsors follow in each country. During the drug approval process, residue limits are targeted for specific animal species and matrices. Therefore, MRLs are commonly not established for other species. This study demonstrates unestablished MRLs can be reliably predicted for under-represented food commodity groups using machine learning (ML). Classification methods with imbalanced data were used to analyze MRL data from multiple countries by implementing resampling techniques in different ML classifiers. Afterward, we developed and evaluated a data-mining method for predicting unestablished MRLs. Seven different ML classifiers such as support vector classifier, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), random forest, decision tree, k-neighbors, Gaussian NB, and AdaBoost have been selected in this baseline study. Among these, the neural network MLP classifier reliably scored the highest averageweighted F1 score (accuracy >99% with markers and & AP;88% without markets) in predicting unestablished MRLs. This provides the first study to apply ML algorithms in regulatory food animal medicine. By predicting and estimating MRLs, we can potentially decrease the use and cost of live animals and the overall research burden of determining new MRLs.

AB Wireless Brain Machine Interface (BMI) communication protocols are faced with the challenge of transmitting the activity of hundreds of neurons which requires large bandwidth. Previously a data compression scheme for neural activity was introduced based on Self Organizing Maps (SOM). In this paper we propose a dynamic learning rule for improved training of the SOM on signals with sparse events which allows for more representative prototype vectors to be found, and consequently better signal reconstruction. This work was developed with BMI applications in mind and therefore our examples are geared towards this type of signals. The simulation results show that the proposed strategy outperforms conventional vector quantization methods for spike reconstruction. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB The steps of artificial intelligence in healthcare can be described and visualized from development to widespread use as a lifecycle. Viewing healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) as a lifecycle can help identify and address the ethical issues that arise at each step. This approach addresses barriers in healthcare AI resulting from how people in different positions vary in their interests and perceptions related to AI, which can lead to challenges in how ethical issues are addressed. In this paper, we have built a sample lifecycle using the elements of previously existing lifecycles, filling in gaps to be more comprehensive. We then show how ethical issues arise at different points and present example questions that should be considered throughout the lifecycle. We then use the process of examining ethical issues through the lens of the lifecycle and apply it to 3 case studies. This approach to examining the ethical issues can be applied by people in various positions, including developers of an AI system to end-users, to facilitate communication among different stakeholders to anticipate and address problems.

AB Media systems that personalize their offerings keep track of users' tastes by constantly learning from their activities. Some systems use this characteristic of machine learning to encourage users with statements like "the more you use the system, the better it can serve you in the future." However, it is not clear whether users indeed feel encouraged and consider the system to be helpful and beneficial, or begin to worry about jeopardizing their privacy in the process. We conducted a between-subjects experiment (N = 269) to find out. Guided by the HAIITIME model (Sundar, 2020), we examined the effects of both explicit and implicit cues on the interface which conveyed that the machine is learning. Data indicate that users consider the system to be a helper and tend to trust it more when the system is transparent about its learning, regardless of the quality of its performance and the degree of explicitness in conveying the fact that it is learning from their activities. The study found no evidence to suggest privacy concerns arising from the machine disclosing that it is learning from its users. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of deploying machine learning cues to enhance user experience of AI-embedded systems.

AB Partial differential equations (PDEs) play a foundational role in modeling physical phenomena. This study addresses the challenging task of determining variable coefficients within PDEs from measurement data. We introduce a novel neural network, 'pseudo-differential IAEnet' (pd-IAEnet), which draws inspiration from pseudo-differential operators. pd-IAEnet achieves significantly enhanced computational speed and accuracy with fewer parameters compared to conventional models. Extensive benchmark evaluations are conducted across a range of inverse problems, including electrical impedance tomography, optical tomography, and seismic imaging, consistently demonstrating pd-IAEnet's superior accuracy. Notably, pd-IAEnet exhibits robustness in the presence of measurement noise, a critical characteristic for real-world applications. An exceptional feature is its discretization invariance, enabling effective training on data from diverse discretization schemes while maintaining accuracy on different meshes. In summary, pd-IAEnet offers a potent and efficient solution for addressing inverse PDE problems, contributing to improved computational efficiency, robustness, and adaptability to a wide array of data sources.

AB Background The health burden in developing world informal settlements often coincides with a lack of spatial data that could be used to guide intervention strategies. Spatial video (SV) has proven to be a useful tool to collect environmental and social data at a granular scale, though the effort required to turn these spatially encoded video frames into maps limits sustainability and scalability. In this paper we explore the use of convolution neural networks (CNN) to solve this problem by automatically identifying disease related environmental risks in a series of SV collected from Haiti. Our objective is to determine the potential of machine learning in health risk mapping for these environments by assessing the challenges faced in adequately training the required classification models. Results We show that SV can be a suitable source for automatically identifying and extracting health risk features using machine learning. While well-defined objects such as drains, buckets, tires and animals can be efficiently classified, more amorphous masses such as trash or standing water are difficult to classify. Our results further show that variations in the number of image frames selected, the image resolution, and combinations of these can be used to improve the overall model performance. Conclusion Machine learning in combination with spatial video can be used to automatically identify environmental risks associated with common health problems in informal settlements, though there are likely to be variations in the type of data needed for training based on location. Success based on the risk type being identified are also likely to vary geographically. However, we are confident in identifying a series of best practices for data collection, model training and performance in these settings. We also discuss the next step of testing these findings in other environments, and how adding in the simultaneously collected geographic data could be used to create an automatic health risk mapping tool.

AB Agricultural herbicide application efficiency can be improved using smart sprayers which provide site-specific, rather than broadcast, applications of agrochemicals. The YOLOv3-Tiny convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained to detect two weeds, hair fescue and sheep sorrel, in images captured from wild blueberry fields throughout Nova Scotia, Canada. An evaluation was performed in three commercial wild blueberry fields in Nova Scotia to examine the effects of camera selection and target distance on detection accuracy. A Canon T6 DSLR camera, an LG G6 smartphone, and a Logitech c920 webcam were used to capture RGB images at varying distances from target weeds. Mean F 1-scores for each combination of camera and image height were analysed in a 3 x 3 factorial arrangement for hair fescue and a 3 x 2 factorial arrangement for sheep sorrel. Images captured from 0.98 m with the LG G6 and Canon T6 produced F 1-scores of up to 0.97 for detection of at least one hair fescue tuft. Images captured with the LG G6 and Canon T6 DSLR from 0.57 m achieved F 1-scores of 0.94 and 0.93, respectively, for detection of at least one sheep sorrel plant per image. Sheep sorrel was undetectable in images from the Logitech c920 under 19 of 27 parameter combinations. Future work will involve using the CNN to control herbicide applications with a real-time smart sprayer. Additionally, the CNN will be used in a web-based application to detect target weeds and provide site-specific information to aid management decisions. Using a CNN to detect weeds will create improvements in management techniques, resulting in cost-savings and greater sustainability for the wild blueberry industry.

   Multi-task twin support vector machine; Quadratic programming problems
AB In recent years, multi-task learning (MTL) has become a popular field in machine learning and has a key role in various domains. Sharing knowledge across tasks in MTL can improve the performance of learning algorithms and enhance their generalization capability. A new approach called the multi-task least squares twin support vector machine (MTLS-TSVM) was recently proposed as a least squares variant of the direct multi-task twin support vector machine (DMTSVM). Unlike DMTSVM, which solves two quadratic programming problems, MTLS-TSVM solves two linear systems of equations, resulting in a reduced computational time. In this paper, we propose an enhanced version of MTLS-TSVM called the improved multi-task least squares twin support vector machine (IMTLS-TSVM). IMTLS-TSVM offers a significant advantage over MTLS-TSVM by operating based on the empirical risk minimization principle, which allows for better generalization performance. The model achieves this by including regularization terms in its objective function, which helps control the model's complexity and prevent overfitting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IMTLS-TSVM by comparing it to several single-task and multi-task learning algorithms on various real-world data sets. Our results highlight the superior performance of IMTLS-TSVM in addressing multi-task learning problems.

   IN LEGAL EDUCATION

DT Article
DE Law and Literature; Law and Science Fiction; Law and Time Travel;
   Artificial Intelligence; Emotional Intelligence and the Law
AB Science fiction and time travel can be used to inform and enhance the education of law students in profound ways. Within the broader field of law and literature, the relationship between law and science fiction, especially time travel stories, is rich and useful. Themes and concepts in time travel can be applied in the exploration of existing legal philosophies as well as a more expansive and engaging study of power, authority, freedom, and a number of global issues. As governments and people worldwide wrestle with climate change, armed conflict, pandemics, and the increasing significance of artificial intelligence and other advances in technology, time travel stories give students unique contexts in which to consider what law is and the degree to which it defines human experience. For generations, brilliant science fiction writers have offered thought-provoking stories and worlds that law professors and their students can use to reimagine legal thought and practice. Like its close relatives, mythology and fantasy, the science fiction genre is untethered to current social or political experience or projections necessarily corrupted by narrowly conceived historical perspectives. Science fiction writers are interested in illuminating possibilities by considering identifiable problems in unidentifiable environments. It is no accident that gender identity, racism, reproductive rights, extremist ideologies, global health crises, and various recognizable forms of labor exploitation are addressed in provocative and insightful ways by a number of the best science fiction writers. Law has a strong presence in their work. Judges, law givers, ruling groups, and other less familiar forms of power and control appear in these stories and help to move and shape the experience of the time traveler. Law students can draw on the work of these writers to consider old questions in new and refreshingly broad ways. The importance of communication and access to information are also strong themes common to law and science fiction. How are concepts of truth and propaganda significant to power? Is truth necessary for legitimacy? Information technologies introduced in the science fiction world now exist in real time in forms and with speed and volume unimagined even a few decades ago. As artificial intelligence becomes dominant in many aspects of our daily lives, law students must consider how it may change law making, court procedures, entire legal systems, and perhaps even concepts of justice. As a project, law students might develop a case and conduct a trial using an AI judge or try a case to an AI jury. How human is the law? The role of emotional intelligence and concepts like mercy, restorative justice, forgiveness, or retribution are also things they might explore in seminars or other classes using science fiction literature and other time travel media as a framework.

AB Callose is a polysaccharide that can be fluorescently stained to study many developmental and immune functions in plants. High-throughput methods to accurately gather quantitative measurements of callose from confocal images are useful for many applications in plant biology. Previous callose quantification methods relied upon binary local thresholding, which had the disadvantage of not being able to differentiate callose in conditions with low contrast from background material. Here, a measurement approach that utilizes the Ilastik supervised machine learning imagery data collection software is described. The Ilastik software method provided superior efficiency for acquiring counts of callose deposits. We also determined the accuracy of these methods as compared to manual counts. We demonstrate that the automated software methods are both good predictors of manual counts, but that the Ilastik counts are significantly closer. Researchers can use this information to guide their choice of method to quantify callose in their work.

AB As the first step in image interpretation is detection, an error in perception can prematurely end the diagnostic process leading to missed diagnoses. Because perceptual errors of this sort-"failure to detect"-are the most common interpretive error (and cause of litigation) in radiology, understanding the nature of perceptual expertise is essential in decreasing radiology's long-standing error rates. In this article, we review what constitutes a perceptual error, the existing models of radiologic image perception, the development of perceptual expertise and how it can be tested, perceptual learning methods in training radiologists, and why understanding perceptual expertise is still relevant in the era of artificial intelligence. Adding targeted interventions, such as perceptual learning, to existing teaching practices, has the potential to enhance expertise and reduce medical error.

AB Mammography is the recommended imaging modality for breast cancer screening. Expressions of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), estrogen receptor (ER), and progesterone receptor (PR) are critical to the development of therapeutic strategies for breast cancer. In this study, a deep learning model (CBAM ResNet-18) was developed to predict the expression of these three receptors on mammography without manual segmentation of masses. Mammography of patients with pathologically proven breast cancer was obtained from two centers. A deep learning-based model (CBAM ResNet-18) for predicting HER2, ER, and PR expressions was trained and validated using five-fold cross-validation on a training dataset. The performance of the model was further tested using an external test dataset. Area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), and F1-score were calculated to assess the ability of the model to predict each receptor. For comparison we also developed original ResNet-18 without attention module and VGG-19 with and without attention module. The AUC (95% CI), ACC, and F1-score were 0.708 (0.609, 0.808), 0.651, 0.528, respectively, in the HER2 test dataset; 0.785 (0.673, 0.897), 0.845, 0.905, respectively, in the ER test dataset; and 0.706 (0.603, 0.809), 0.678, 0.773, respectively, in the PR test dataset. The proposed model demonstrates superior performance compared to the original ResNet-18 without attention module and VGG-19 with and without attention module. The model has the potential to predict HER2, PR, and especially ER expressions, and thus serve as an adjunctive diagnostic tool for breast cancer.

TI Earth Imagery Segmentation on Terrain Surface with Limited Training
   Labels: A Semi-supervised Approach based on Physics-Guided Graph
   Co-Training

DE Earth image segmentation; terrain surface; contour tree; physic-guided;
   semi-supervised
AB Given earth imagery with spectral features on a terrain surface, this paper studies surface segmentation based on both explanatory features and surface topology. The problem is important in many spatial and spatiotem-poral applications such as flood extent mapping in hydrology. The problem is uniquely challenging for several reasons: first, the size of earth imagery on a terrain surface is often much larger than the input of popular deep convolutional neural networks; second, there exists topological structure dependency between pixel classes on the surface, and such dependency can follow an unknown and non-linear distribution; third, there are often limited training labels. Existing methods for earth imagery segmentation often divide the imagery into patches and consider the elevation as an additional feature channel. These methods do not fully incorporate the spatial topological structural constraint within and across surface patches and thus often show poor results, especially when training labels are limited. Existing methods on semi-supervised and unsupervised learning for earth imagery often focus on learning representation without explicitly incorporating surface topology. In contrast, we propose a novel framework that explicitly models the topological skeleton of a terrain surface with a contour tree from computational topology, which is guided by the physical constraint (e.g., water flow direction on terrains). Our framework consists of two neural networks: a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn spatial contextual features on a 2D image grid, and a graph neural network (GNN) to learn the statistical distribution of physics-guided spatial topological dependency on the contour tree. The two models are co-trained via variational EM. Evaluations on the real-world flood mapping datasets show that the proposed models outperform baseline methods in classification accuracy, especially when training labels are limited.

AB The globalized semiconductor supply chain significantly increases the risk of exposing System-on-Chip (SoC) designs to hardware Trojans. While machine learning (ML) based Trojan detection approaches are promising due to their scalability as well as detection accuracy, ML-based methods themselves are vulnerable from Trojan attacks. In this paper, we propose a robust backdoor attack on ML-based Trojan detection algorithms to demonstrate this serious vulnerability. The proposed framework is able to design an AI Trojan and implant it inside the ML model that can be triggered by specific inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed AI Trojans can bypass state-of-the-art defense algorithms. Moreover, our approach provides a fast and cost-effective solution in achieving 100% attack success rate that outperforms state-of-the art methods based on adversarial attacks.

ID CHALLENGES
AB Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach to collaboratively train machine learning models across multiple edge devices while preserving privacy. The success of FL hinges on the efficiency of participating models and their ability to handle the unique challenges of distributed learning. While several variants of Vision Transformer (ViT) have shown great potential as alternatives to modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for centralized training, the unprecedented size and higher computational demands hinder their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, challenging their widespread application in FL. Since client devices in FL typically have limited computing resources and communication bandwidth, models intended for such devices must strike a balance between model size, computational efficiency, and the ability to adapt to the diverse and non-IID data distributions encountered in FL. To address these challenges, we propose OnDev-LCT: Lightweight Convolutional Transformers for On-Device vision tasks with limited training data and resources. Our models incorporate image-specific inductive biases through the LCT tokenizer by leveraging efficient depthwise separable convolutions in residual linear bottleneck blocks to extract local features, while the multi-head self-attention (MHSA) mechanism in the LCT encoder implicitly facilitates capturing global representations of images. Extensive experiments on benchmark image datasets indicate that our models outperform existing lightweight vision models while having fewer parameters and lower computational demands, making them suitable for FL scenarios with data heterogeneity and communication bottlenecks.

AB Both the vastness of pasturelands and the value they contain-e.g., food security, ecosystem services-have resulted in increased scientific and industry efforts to remotely monitor them via satellite imagery and machine learning (ML). However, the transferability of these models is uncertain, as modelers commonly train and test on site-specific or homogenized-i.e., randomly partitioned-datasets and choose complex ML algorithms with increased potential to overfit a limited dataset. In this study, we evaluated the accuracy and transferability of remote sensing pasture models, using multiple ML algorithms and evaluation structures. Specifically, we predicted pasture above-ground biomass and nitrogen concentration from Sentinel-2 imagery. The implemented ML algorithms include principal components regression (PCR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), random forest (RF), support vector machine regression (SVR), and a gradient boosting model (GBM). The evaluation structures were determined using levels of spatial and temporal dissimilarity to partition the train and test datasets. Our results demonstrated a general decline in accuracy as evaluation structures increase in spatiotemporal dissimilarity. In addition, the more simplistic algorithms-PCR, PLSR, and LASSO-out-performed the more complex models RF, SVR, and GBM for the prediction of dissimilar evaluation structures. We conclude that multi-spectral satellite and pasture physiological variable datasets, such as the one presented in this study, contain spatiotemporal internal dependence, which makes the generalization of predictive models to new localities challenging, especially for complex ML algorithms. Further studies on this topic should include the assessment of model transferability by using dissimilar evaluation structures, and we expect generalization to improve for larger and denser datasets.

AB System-on-chip (SoC) developers increasingly rely on pre-verified hardware intellectual property (IP) blocks often acquired from untrusted third-party vendors. These IPs might contain hidden malicious functionalities or hardware Trojans that may compromise the security of the fabricated SoCs. Lack of golden or reference models and vast possible Trojan attack space form some of the major barriers in detecting hardware Trojans in these third-party IP (3PIP) blocks. Recently, supervised machine learning (ML) techniques have shown promising capability in identifying nets of potential Trojans in 3PIPs without the need for golden models. However, they bring several major challenges. First, they do not guide us to an optimal choice of features that reliably covers diverse classes of Trojans. Second, they require multiple Trojan-free/trusted designs to insert known Trojans and generate a trained model. Even if a set of trusted designs are available for training, the suspect IP can have an inherently very different structure from the set of trusted designs, which may negatively impact the verification outcome. Third, these techniques only identify a set of suspect Trojan nets that require manual intervention to understand the potential threat. In this article, we present VIPR, a systematic machine learning (ML)-based trust verification solution for 3PIPs that eliminates the need for trusted designs for training. We present a comprehensive framework, associated algorithms, and a tool flow for obtaining an optimal set of features, training a targeted machine learning model, detecting suspect nets, and identifying Trojan circuitry from the suspect nets. We evaluate the framework on several Trust-Hub Trojan benchmarks and provide a comparative analysis of detection performance across different trained models, selection of features, and post-processing techniques. We demonstrate promising Trojan detection accuracy for VIPR with up to 92.85% reduction in false positives by the proposed post-processing algorithm.

AB BackgroundFour-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) is an es sential tool in radiation therapy. However, the 4D acquisition process may cause motion artifacts which can obscure anatomy and distort functional measurements from CT scans.PurposeWe describe a deep learning algorithm to identify the location of artifacts within 4DCT images. Our method is flexible enough to handle different types of artifacts, including duplication, misalignment, truncation, and interpolation.MethodsWe trained and validated a U-net convolutional neural network artifact detection model on more than 23 000 coronal slices extracted from 98 4DCT scans. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and precision-recall curve were used to evaluate the model's performance at identifying artifacts compared to a manually identified ground truth. The model was adjusted so that the sensitivity in identifying artifacts was equivalent to that of a human observer, as measured by computing the average ratio of artifact volume to lung volume in a given scan.ResultsThe model achieved a sensitivity, specificity, and precision of 0.78, 0.99, and 0.58, respectively. The ROC area-under-the-curve (AUC) was 0.99 and the precision-recall AUC was 0.73. Our model sensitivity is 8% higher than previously reported state-of-the-art artifact detection methods.ConclusionsThe model developed in this study is versatile, designed to handle duplication, misalignment, truncation, and interpolation artifacts within a single image, unlike earlier models that were designed for a single artifact type.

AB Spot spraying POST herbicides is an effective approach to reduce herbicide input and weed control cost. Machine vision detection of grass or grass-like weeds in turfgrass systems is a challenging task due to the similarity in plant morphology. In this work, we explored the feasibility of using image classification with deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN), including AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and VGGNet, for detection of crabgrass species (Digitariaspp.), doveweed [Murdannia nudiflora(L.) Brenan], dallisgrass (Paspalum dilatatumPoir.), and tropical signalgrass [Urochloa distachya(L.) T.Q. Nguyen] in bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon(L.) Pers.]. VGGNet generally outperformed AlexNet and GoogLeNet in detecting selected grassy weeds. For detection ofP. dilatatum, VGGNet achieved high F1 scores (>= 0.97) and recall values (>= 0.99). A single VGGNet model exhibited high F1 scores (>= 0.93) and recall values (1.00) that reliably detectedDigitariaspp.,M. nudiflora,P. dilatatum, andU. distachya. Low weed density reduced the recall values of AlexNet at detecting all weed species and GoogLeNet at detectingDigitaria spp. In comparison, VGGNet achieved excellent performances (overall accuracy = 1.00) at detecting all weed species in both high and low weed-density scenarios. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using DCNN for detection of grass or grass-like weeds in turfgrass systems.

AB The field of brain-machine interfaces requires the estimation of a mapping from spike trains collected in motor cortex areas to the hand kinematics of the behaving animal. This paper presents a systematic investigation of several linear (Wiener filter, LMS adaptive filters, gamma filter, subspace Wiener filters) and nonlinear models (time-delay neural network and local linear switching models) applied to datasets from two experiments in monkeys performing motor tasks (reaching for food and target hitting). Ensembles of 100-200 cortical neurons were simultaneously recorded in these experiments, and even larger neuronal samples are anticipated in the future. Due to the large size of the models (thousands of parameters), the major issue studied was the generalization performance. Every parameter of the models (not only the weights) was selected optimally using signal processing and machine learning techniques. The models were also compared statistically with respect to the Wiener filter as the baseline. Each of the optimization procedures produced improvements over that baseline for either one of the two datasets or both.

AB Digital images have applications in almost every field, such as medicine, autonomous vehicles, astronomy, etc., for various purposes. The performance of all these applications depends on the quality of the images; that is, digital images should be noise-free for better results. Due to various factors, images capture noise at the acquisition time, which needs to be removed before subsequent applications. Therefore, this paper presents a dual residual dense network for image denoising. The network is designed using three types of blocks: feature extraction blocks, combination blocks, and residual blocks. These blocks exploit residual learning, dense connectivity, and batch renormalization to remove image noise. The network is also designed to be wide rather than deep, which makes it computationally and time-efficient. The network was trained on the DIV2K dataset and tested on the Kodak24 and Berkeley Segmentation (BSDS300) datasets. The results show that the proposed network outperforms existing state-of-the-art architectures in image denoising, achieving peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) scores of 35.03 for the Kodak dataset and 34.64 for the BSDS300 dataset, as well as structural similarity index measure (SSIM) scores of 0.99 for both datasets. The code of the proposed method is publicly available to allow others to reproduce the findings and validate the results.

AB Exoplanet discovery at long orbital periods requires reliably detecting individual transits without additional information about the system. Common techniques, like phase folding of light curves and periodogram analysis of radial velocity data, are more sensitive to planets with shorter orbital periods, leaving a dearth of planet discoveries at long periods. We present a novel technique using an ensemble of convolutional neural networks incorporating the onboard spacecraft diagnostics of Kepler to classify transits within a light curve. We create a pipeline to recover the location of individual transits, and the period of the orbiting planet, which possesses an accuracy of >80% in the long orbital period regime (50 <= P <= 800 days). Our neural network pipeline has the potential to discover additional planets in the Kepler data set, and crucially, within the eta-Earth regime. We report our first candidate from this pipeline, KOI-1271.02. KOI-1271.01 is known to exhibit strong transit timing variations (TTVs), and so we jointly model the TTVs and transits of both transiting planets to constrain the orbital configuration and planetary parameters and conclude with a series of potential parameters for KOI-1271.02, as there are not enough data currently to uniquely constrain the system. We conclude that KOI-1271.02 has a radius of 5.32 +/- 0.20 R-circle plus and most likely a mass of 28.94(-0.47)(0.23 )M(circle plus). Future constraints on the nature of KOI-1271.02 require measuring additional TTVs of KOI-1271.01 or observing a second transit of KOI-1271.02.

AB Tree crown detection is a fundamental task in remote sensing for forestry and ecosystem ecology. While many individual tree segmentation algorithms have been proposed, the development and testing of these algorithms is typically site specific, with few methods evaluated against data from multiple forest types simultaneously. This makes it difficult to determine the generalization of proposed approaches, and limits tree detection at broad scales. Using data from the National Ecological Observatory Network, we extend a recently developed deep learning approach to include data from a range of forest types to determine whether information from one forest can be used for tree detection in other forests, and explore the potential for building a universal tree detection algorithm. We find that the deep learning approach works well for overstory tree detection across forest conditions. Performance was best in open oak woodlands and worst in alpine forests. When models were fit to one forest type and used to predict another, performance generally decreased, with better performance when forests were more similar in structure. However, when models were pretrained on data from other sites and then finetuned using a relatively small amount of hand-labeled data from the evaluation site, they performed similarly to local site models. Most importantly, a model fit to data from all sites performed as well or better than individual models trained for each local site.

AB We propose using support vector machines (SVMs) to learn the efficient set in multiple objective discrete optimization (MODO). We conjecture that a surface generated by SVM could provide a good approximation of the efficient set. As one way of testing this idea, we embed the SVM-approximated efficient set information into a Genetic Algorithm (GA). This is accomplished by using a SVM-based fitness function that guides the GA search. We implement our SVM-guided GA on the multiple objective knapsack and assignment problems. We observe that using SVM improves the performance of the GA compared to a benchmark distance based fitness function and may provide competitive results. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Privacy laws and app stores (e.g., Google Play Store) require mobile apps to have transparent privacy policies to disclose sensitive actions and data collection, such as accessing the phonebook, camera, storage, GPS, and microphone. However, many mobile apps do not accurately disclose their sensitive data access that requires sensitive ('dangerous') permissions. Thus, analyzing discrepancies between apps' permissions and privacy policies facilitates the identification of compliance issues upon which privacy regulators and marketplace operators can act. In this paper, we propose PermPress - an automated machine-learning system to evaluate an Android app's permission-completeness, i.e., whether its privacy policy matches its dangerous permissions. PermPress combines machine learning techniques with human annotation of privacy policies to establish whether app policies contain permission-relevant information. PermPress leverages MPP-270, an annotated policy corpus, for establishing a gold standard dataset of permission completeness. This corpus shows that only 31% of apps disclose all dangerous permissions in privacy policies. By leveraging the annotated dataset and machine learning techniques, PermPress achieves an AUC score of 0.92 in predicting the permission-completeness of apps. A large-scale evaluation of 164,156 Android apps shows that, on average, 7% of apps do not disclose more than half of their declared dangerous permissions in privacy policies, whereas 60% of apps omit to disclose at least one dangerous permission-related data collection in privacy policies. Our investigation uncovers the non-transparent state of app privacy policies and highlights the need to standardize app privacy policies' compliance and completeness checking process.

   REPRESENTATION
AB Machine learning (ML) methods have become powerful, predictive tools in a wide range of applications, such as facial recognition and autonomous vehicles. In the sciences, computational chemists and physicists have been using ML for the prediction of physical phenomena, such as atomistic potential energy surfaces and reaction pathways. Transferable ML potentials, such as ANI-1x, have been developed with the goal of accurately simulating organic molecules containing the chemical elements H, C, N, and O. Here, we provide an extension of the ANI-1x model. The new model, dubbed ANI-2x, is trained to three additional chemical elements: S, F, and Cl. Additionally, ANI-2x underwent torsional refinement training to better predict molecular torsion profiles. These new features open a wide range of new applications within organic chemistry and drug development. These seven elements (H, C, N, O, F, Cl, and S) make up similar to 90% of drug-like molecules. To show that these additions do not sacrifice accuracy, we have tested this model across a range of organic molecules and applications, including the COMP6 benchmark, dihedral rotations, conformer scoring, and nonbonded interactions. ANI-2x is shown to accurately predict molecular energies compared to density functional theory with a similar to 106 factor speedup and a negligible slowdown compared to ANI-1x and shows subchemical accuracy across most of the COMP6 benchmark. The resulting model is a valuable tool for drug development which can potentially replace both quantum calculations and classical force fields for a myriad of applications.

AB This investigation was conducted to examine whether older adults would improve their performance when given statements intended to make them feel important to a research study as well as statements concerning their over-all well-being. Women (n = 14) and men (n = 15) with mean ages of 76.0 yr. and 75.1 yr., respectively, were randomly assigned into a control group, a positive reinforcement group, and a group given statements of personal importance. Dependent measures on a rotary pursuit task, screw-and-nut assembly task, and an interest questionnaire were obtained during three separate visits. Data were analyzed with a 3 x 3 (Groups x Days) analysis of variance. While no significant group effects were found on any measure, a significant main effect was obtained for days, indicative of learning.

TI A Machine-Learning Approach to Classify Cloud-to-Ground and Intracloud

SO GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS

DT Article
ID WAVE-FORMS; MILLISECOND
AB To know if a lightning discharge reaches the ground or remains within the thundercloud is critical for lightning safety as cloud-to-ground lightning poses the greatest threat to life and property. The current classification methods for most lightning detection networks, which are based on the classification of electromagnetic pulses produced by lightning, still have plenty of room to improve, including some known issues to be addressed. We present a machine-learning approach to classify lightning discharges. The classification model used in this study is based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs). Compared with traditional multiparameter methods, our algorithm does not require extraction of individual pulse parameters and additionally provides a probability for each prediction. Using a representative lightning pulse data collected by the Cordoba Marx Meter Array in Argentina, we found the classification accuracy of our machine-learning algorithm to be 97%, which is higher than that for the existing lightning detection networks.
   Plain Language Summary Electromagnetic signals emitted by lightning can be detected by sensors that are hundreds of kilometers away. Those signals are used to distinguish if the lightning discharge reaches the ground or remains inside the cloud. Higher accuracy of lightning type classification can lead to a better assessment of lightning risk and is also beneficial to lightning climatology studies. We present a machine-learning-based algorithm to classify lightning pulses. The accuracy of the algorithm is 97%, which is better than those for classification algorithms used by lightning detection networks.

AB Metastable gamma-CsPbI3 is a promising solar cell material due to its suitable band gap and chemical stability. While this metastable perovskite structure can be achieved via introducing external pressure or strain, experimenting with this material is still challenging due to its phase instability. In this work, we present the first instance of exploiting various machine learning (ML) models to efficiently predict the band gap and enthalpy of metastable gamma-CsPbI3 under pressure or strain while identifying key structural features that determine these properties. ML models trained on experimentally benchmarked, first-principles calculation datasets exhibit excellent performance in predicting the behavior of tuned systems, comparable to predictions made for ambient material databases. In particular, graph neural networks (GNNs) that explicitly include a graph encoding the bond angle information outperform other ML models in most scenarios. The pressure-tuned system demonstrates a strong linear relationship between structural features and properties, effectively captured by global structural features using linear regression models. In contrast, the strain-tuned system shows a non-linear relationship, exhibiting superior prediction performance using GNNs trained on local environments. This study opens up opportunities to apply and develop ML models for understanding and designing materials under extreme conditions.

AB Human pathophysiology is occasionally too complex for unaided hypothetical-deductive reasoning and the isolated application of additive or linear statistical methods. Clustering algorithms use input data patterns and distributions to form groups of similar patients or diseases that share distinct properties. Although clinicians frequently perform tasks that may be enhanced by clustering, few receive formal training and clinician-centered literature in clustering is sparse. To add value to clinical care and research, optimal clustering practices require a thorough understanding of how to process and optimize data, select features, weigh strengths and weaknesses of different clustering methods, select the optimal clustering method, and apply clustering methods to solve problems. These concepts and our suggestions for implementing them are described in this narrative review of published literature. All clustering methods share the weakness of finding potential clusters even when natural clusters do not exist, underscoring the importance of applying data-driven techniques as well as clinical and statistical expertise to clustering analyses. When applied properly, patient and disease phenotype clustering can reveal obscured associations that can help clinicians understand disease pathophysiology, predict treatment response, and identify patients for clinical trial enrollment.

AB Amid mounting interest in artificial intelligence (AI) technology, communication scholars have sought to understand humans' perceptions of and attitudes toward AI's predictions, recommendations, and decisions. Meanwhile, scholars in the nascent but growing field of explainable AI (XAI) have aimed to clarify AI's operational mechanisms and make them interpretable, visible, and transparent. In this conceptual article, we suggest that a conversation between human-machine communication (HMC) and XAI is advantageous and necessary. Following the introduction of these two areas, we demonstrate how research on XAI can inform the HMC scholarship regarding the human-in-the-loop approach and the message production explainability. Next, we expound upon how communication scholars' focuses on message sources, receivers, features, and effects can reciprocally benefit XAI research. At its core, this article proposes a two-level HMC framework and posits that bridging the two fields can guide future AI research and development.

AB Biggs' (1987) Learning Process Questionnaire (LPQ) is a widely acknowledged measure of student approaches to learning. However, its utility in predicting actual school achievement and in multi-cultural contexts is unknown. This study investigated the validity of Biggs' LPQ and its underlying theory in predicting academic achievement in Zimbabwean multiracial schools. Three hundred and seventy-six Zimbabwean black (157) and white (219) students (mean age = 12.3 years; SD = .7) attending six racially integrated schools took part in the study. Students who reportedly used a surface approach to learning achieved lower levels of academic achievement compared to those who reportedly used deep and achieving approaches. Compared to white students, black students who reported higher use of a deep approach had lower academic grades. Students who reported a higher use of a surface strategy and taught by female teachers displayed significantly lower academic achievement than those who reported use of deep approaches. Support was found for the LPQ and its underlying theory. They appear to have some potential as research tool for use in Zimbabwean multiracial schools.

AB Despite a growing body of research on AI adoption and use, the impact of various psychological and technological factors on users' decision-making processes remains largely understudied. To bridge this gap, this study examines the combined influence of self-efficacy, AI ethics, and technological factors on users' attitudes toward the use of AI technologies. Using an integrated theoretical model that combines self-efficacy theory and the technology acceptance model, this study conducted a nationwide survey in the U.S. (N = 1252) to test the multistage process of determining users' attitudes toward the use of AI technologies. The results showed that perceived AI ethics plays a vital role in mediating between self-efficacy and technological factors, leading to a more positive attitude toward AI technologies. This study contributes to the AI adoption literature by advancing an integrated model to unveil the underlying mechanisms influencing users' attitudes toward AI. Theoretical and practical implications are further discussed.

AB Background: To detect attributes of medical concepts in clinical text, a traditional method often consists of two steps: named entity recognition of attributes and then relation classification between medical concepts and attributes. Here we present a novel solution, in which attribute detection of given concepts is converted into a sequence labeling problem, thus attribute entity recognition and relation classification are done simultaneously within one step.
   Methods: A neural architecture combining bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks and Conditional Random fields (Bi-LSTMs-CRF) was adopted to detect various medical concept-attribute pairs in an efficient way. We then compared our deep learning-based sequence labeling approach with traditional two-step systems for three different attribute detection tasks: disease-modifier, medication-signature, and lab test-value.
   Results: Our results show that the proposed method achieved higher accuracy than the traditional methods for all three medical concept-attribute detection tasks.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates the efficacy of our sequence labeling approach using Bi-LSTM-CRFs on the attribute detection task, indicating its potential to speed up practical clinical NLP applications.

TI KNOWLEDGE-BASED CONNECTIONISM FOR REVISING DOMAIN THEORIES
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SYSTEMS MAN AND CYBERNETICS
LA English
DT Article
AB Integration of domain theory into empirical learning is important in building a useful learning system in practical domains since the theory is not always perfect and the data is not always adequate. A novel knowledge-based connectionist model referred to as KBCNN for machine learning is presented. In the KBCNN learning model, useful domain attributes and concepts are first identified and linked in a way consistent with initial domain knowledge, and then the links are weighted properly so as to maintain the semantics. Hidden units and additional connections may be introduced into this initial connectionist structure as appropriate. Then, this primitive structure evolves to minimize empirical error. The KBCNN learning model allows the theory learned or revised to be translated into the symbolic rule-based language that describes the initial theory. Thus, a domain theory can be pushed onto the network, revised empirically over time, and decoded in symbolic form. The domain of molecular genetics has been used to demonstrate the validity of the KBCNN learning model and its superiority over related learning methods.

AB This research revisits the communication mediation model to understand when citizens support AI policies. Using data from a national online survey (N = 1252), our research delineates the mechanism by which AI-related news consumption enhances AI literacy through AI-related discussions, subsequently fostering enhanced support for AI policies and regulations. In this process, AI efficacy emerges as a critical boundary condition. Specifically, the relationship between AI-related news consumption and support for AI policy and regulation via AI discussions and literacy varies contingent on levels of AI efficacy. The findings highlight a moderated indirect effect, whereby the positive influence from AI-related news consumption to support for AI policy and regulation through AI discussions and AI literacy only occurs when citizens have high levels of AI efficacy. This research offers a deeper understanding of the factors encouraging citizen engagement in AI policy and regulation activities and provides valuable insights for AI literacy and education from theoretical, practical, and policy perspectives.

AB Runoff is pivotal in water resource management and ecological conservation. Current research predominantly emphasizes enhancing the precision of machine learning-based runoff predictions, with limited focus on their physical interpretability. This study introduces an innovative two-step hybrid runoff prediction framework tailored for the headwater region of the Yellow River Basin (YRB) to improve prediction accuracy and elucidate the runoff modeling process. The framework integrates machine learning techniques with dual signal decomposition approaches, incorporating diverse hydrometeorological and geographic indicators. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithms were employed to predict monthly runoff generation in sub-basins delineated by the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), which were subsequently integrated using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for monthly runoff concentration prediction. Results indicate that the proposed models delivered superior prediction performance compared to the SWAT model (R2 = 0.86, NSE = 0.85), with the LSTM-based two-step hybrid model (R2 = 0.90, NSE = 0.90) outperforming the XGBoost-based model (R2 = 0.89, NSE = 0.88). The dual decomposition method, integrating seasonal-trend decomposition based on loess (STL) and successive variational mode decomposition (SVMD), demonstrated exceptional efficacy in addressing the complexities of hydrometeorological time series. Models decomposed by STL-SVMD exhibited the highest average R2 and NSE values, as well as the lowest RMSE and MAE values in sub- basin runoff calculations. The low standard deviations of performance metrics further underscored the stability of these models across all sub-basins. This study demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed two-step hybrid model for simulating physical runoff processes in the headwater region of the YRB, providing valuable insights for regional hydrological cycle research and hydro-ecological security.

AB Accurate and timely monitoring of biomass in breeding nurseries is essential for evaluating plant performance and selecting superior genotypes. Traditional methods for phenotyping above-ground biomass in field conditions requires significant time, cost, and labor. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer a rapid and non-destructive approach for phenotyping multiple field plots at a low cost. While Vegetation Indices (VIs) extracted from remote sensing imagery have been widely employed for biomass estimation, they mainly capture spectral information and disregard the 3D canopy structure and spatial pixel relationships. Addressing these limitations, this study, conducted in 2020 and 2021, aimed to explore the potential of integrating UAV multispectral imagery-derived canopy spectral, structural, and textural features with machine learning algorithms for accurate oat biomass estimation. Six oat genotypes planted at two seeding rates were evaluated in two South Dakota locations at multiple growth stages. Plot-level canopy spectral, structural, and textural features were extracted from the multispectral imagery and used as input variables for three machine learning models: Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Random Forest Regression (RFR). The results showed that (1) in addition to canopy spectral features, canopy structural and textural features are also important indicators for oat biomass estimation; (2) combining spectral, structural, and textural features significantly improved biomass estimation accuracy over using a single feature type; (3) machine learning algorithms showed good predictive ability with slightly better estimation accuracy shown by RFR (R2 = 0.926 and relative root mean square error (RMSE%) = 15.97%). This study demonstrated the benefits of UAV imagery-based multi-feature fusion using machine learning for above-ground biomass estimation in oat breeding nurseries, holding promise for enhancing the efficiency of oat breeding through UAV-based phenotyping and crop management practices.

AB Supervised learning techniques are widely accepted methods to analyze data for scientific and real world problems. Most of these problems require fast and continuous acquisition of data, which are to be used in training the learning system. Therefore, maintaining such systems updated may become cumbersome. Various techniques have been devised in the field of machine learning to solve this problem. In this study, we propose an algorithm to reduce the training data to a substantially small subset of the original training data to train a generalized eigenvalue classifier. The proposed method provides a constructive way to understand the influence of new training data on an existing classification function. We show through numerical experiments that this technique prevents the overfitting problem of the earlier generalized eigenvalue classifiers, while promising a comparable performance in classification with respect to the state-of-the-art classification methods.

TI On the Smoothed Minimum Error Entropy Criterion
SO ENTROPY
LA English

AB Recent studies suggest that the minimum error entropy (MEE) criterion can outperform the traditional mean square error criterion in supervised machine learning, especially in nonlinear and non-Gaussian situations. In practice, however, one has to estimate the error entropy from the samples since in general the analytical evaluation of error entropy is not possible. By the Parzen windowing approach, the estimated error entropy converges asymptotically to the entropy of the error plus an independent random variable whose probability density function (PDF) corresponds to the kernel function in the Parzen method. This quantity of entropy is called the smoothed error entropy, and the corresponding optimality criterion is named the smoothed MEE (SMEE) criterion. In this paper, we study theoretically the SMEE criterion in supervised machine learning where the learning machine is assumed to be nonparametric and universal. Some basic properties are presented. In particular, we show that when the smoothing factor is very small, the smoothed error entropy equals approximately the true error entropy plus a scaled version of the Fisher information of error. We also investigate how the smoothing factor affects the optimal solution. In some special situations, the optimal solution under the SMEE criterion does not change with increasing smoothing factor. In general cases, when the smoothing factor tends to infinity, minimizing the smoothed error entropy will be approximately equivalent to minimizing error variance, regardless of the conditional PDF and the kernel.

AB Restricted, repetitive behaviors are diagnostic for autism and prevalent in other neurodevelopmental disorders. These behaviors cluster as repetitive sensory-motor behaviors and behaviors reflecting resistance to change. The C58 mouse strain is a promising model for these behaviors as it emits high rates of aberrant repetitive sensory motor behaviors. The purpose of the present study was to extend characterization of the C58 model to resistance to change. This was done by comparing C58 to C57BL/6 mice on a reversal learning task under either a 100% or 80%/20% probabilistic reinforcement schedule. In addition, the effect of environmental enrichment on performance of this task was assessed as this rearing condition markedly reduces repetitive sensory-motor behavior in C58 mice. Little difference was observed between C58 and control mice under a 100% schedule of reinforcement. The 80%/20% probabilistic schedule of reinforcement generated substantial strain differences, however. Importantly, no strain difference was observed in acquisition, but C58 mice were markedly impaired in their ability to reverse their pattern of responding from the previously high density reinforcement side. Environmental enrichment did not impact acquisition under the probabilistic reinforcement schedule, but enriched C58 mice performed significantly better than standard housed C58 mice in reversal learning. Thus, C58 mice exhibit behaviors that reflect both repetitive sensory motor behaviors as well as behavior that reflects resistance to change. Moreover, both clusters of repetitive behavior were attenuated by environmental enrichment. Such findings, along with the reported social deficits in C58 mice, increase the translational value of this mouse model to autism.

AB Clicker training has been a popular form of training for decades and is used in zoos, aquariums, and shelters. Only a handful of studies have investigated the efficacy of the clicker-training method itself despite its widespread popularity. In the first study, we used 30 shelter puppies, naive to training, that were split into three different groups: clicker + primary reinforcement, vocal praise + primary reinforcement, and primary reinforcement alone. Each puppy was then trained to perform a "stay" command using seven shaping approximation steps. Puppies had 50 trials to get as far as they could in the shaping plan. We found that puppies in the primary reinforcement-alone group significantly outperformed puppies in the clicker + primary reinforcement group (P = 0.004). A second experiment was conducted to see if the type of behavior trained would influence the efficacy of the clicker use. For the second experiment, we trained a wave, a behavior that required multiple topographical steps. We used 60 shelter puppies, naive to training, and split them into the same three groups (clicker + primary reinforcement, vocal praise + primary reinforcement, and primary reinforcement alone). No significant differences were found between conditions (P > 0.05) when training the wave behavior. These results suggest that different reinforcement strategies may be more or less effective depending on the type of behavior trained; however, we did not find evidence that the addition of a clicker or verbal cue enhanced training performance in either condition compared with using primary reinforcement alone. More research is needed to determine if clickers may have other benefits beyond basic training progression. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI dmTP: A Deep Meta-Learning Based Framework for Mobile Traffic Prediction

   modeling; Time series analysis; Time-frequency analysis; Urban areas
AB Deep learning technologies have been widely exploited to predict mobile traffic. However, individually training deep learning models for various traffic prediction tasks is not only time consuming but also unrealistic, sometimes due to limited traffic records. In this article, we propose a novel deep meta-learning based mobile traffic prediction framework, namely, dmTP, which can adaptively learn to learn the proper prediction model for each distinct prediction task from accumulated meta-knowledge of previously learned prediction tasks. In dmTP, we regard each mobile traffic prediction task as a base-task and adopt an LSTM network with a fixed structure as the base-learner for each base-task. In order to improve the base-learner's prediction accuracy and learning efficiency, we further employ an MLP as the meta-learner to find the optimal hyper-parameter value and initial training status for the base-learner of a new base-task according to its meta-features. Extensive experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate that while guaranteeing a similar or even better prediction accuracy, meta-learning in the proposed dmTP reduces the numbers of epochs and base-samples needed to train the base-learners by around 75 percent and 81 percent, respectively, as compared with the existing prediction models.

AB Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is the most common cause of avoidable vision loss, predominantly affecting the working-age population across the globe. Screening for DR, coupled with timely consultation and treatment, is a globally trusted policy to avoid vision loss. However, implementation of DR screening programs is challenging due to the scarcity of medical professionals able to screen a growing global diabetic population at risk for DR. Computer-aided disease diagnosis in retinal image analysis could provide a sustainable approach for such large-scale screening effort. The recent scientific advances in computing capacity and machine learning approaches provide an avenue for biomedical scientists to reach this goal. Aiming to advance the state-of-the-art in automatic DR diagnosis, a grand challenge on "Diabetic Retinopathy - Segmentation and Grading" was organized in conjunction with the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI-2018). In this paper, we report the set-up and results of this challenge that is primarily based on Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset (IDRiD). There were three principal subchallenges: lesion segmentation, disease severity grading, and localization of retinal landmarks and segmentation. These multiple tasks in this challenge allow to test the generalizability of algorithms, and this is what makes it different from existing ones. It received a positive response from the scientific community with 148 submissions from 495 registrations effectively entered in this challenge. This paper outlines the challenge, its organization, the dataset used, evaluation methods and results of top-performing participating solutions. The top-performing approaches utilized a blend of clinical information, data augmentation, and an ensemble of models. These findings have the potential to enable new developments in retinal image analysis and image-based DR screening in particular. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Frailty assessment is imperative for tailoring healthcare interventions for older adults, but its implementation remains challenging due to the effort and time needed. The advances of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) present a novel opportunity to harness real-world data (RWD) including electronic health records, administrative claims, and other routinely collected medical records for frailty assessments. Methods: We followed the PRISMA-ScR guideline and searched Embase, Web of Science, and PubMed databases for articles that predict frailty using AI through RWD from inception until October 2023. We synthesized and analyzed the selected publications according to their field of application, methodologies employed, validation processes, outcomes achieved, and their respective limitations and strengths. Results: A total of 23 publications were selected from the initial search (N=2067) and bibliography. The approaches to frailty prediction using RWD and AI were categorized into two groups based on the type of data utilized: 1) AI models using structured data and 2) NLP techniques applied to unstructured clinical notes. We found that AI models achieved moderate to high predictive performance in predicting frailty. However, to demonstrate their clinical utility, these models require further validation using external data and a comprehensive assessment of their impact on patients' health outcomes. Additionally, the application of NLP in frailty prediction is still in its early stages. Great potential exists to enhance frailty prediction by integrating structured data and clinical notes. Conclusion: The combination of AI and RWD presents significant opportunities for advancing frailty assessment. To maximize the advantages of these technological advances, future research is needed to rigorously address the challenges associated with the validation of AI models and innovative data integration.

AB In this article, we propose a framework for saliency-based multitarget detection and segmentation of circular-scan synthetic aperture sonar (CSAS) imagery. Our framework relies on a multibranch convolutional encoder-decoder network (MB-CEDN). The encoder portion of the MB-CEDN extracts visual contrast features from CSAS images. These features are fed into dual decoders that perform pixel-level segmentation to mask targets. Each decoder provides different perspectives as to what constitutes a salient target. These opinions are aggregated and cascaded into a deep parsing network to refine the segmentation. We evaluate our framework using real-world CSAS imagery consisting of five broad target classes and compare it with existing approaches from the computer vision literature. We show that our framework outperforms supervised deep saliency networks designed for natural imagery. It greatly outperforms unsupervised saliency approaches developed for natural imagery. This illustrates that natural-image-based models may need to be altered to be effective for this imaging sonar modality.

AB Despite the availability of efficacious direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy, the number of people infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) continues to rise, and HCV remains a leading cause of liver-related morbidity, liver transplantation, and mortality. We developed and validated machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict DAA treatment failure. Using the HCV-TARGET registry of adults who initiated all-oral DAA treatment, we developed elastic net (EN), random forest (RF), gradient boosting machine (GBM), and feedforward neural network (FNN) ML algorithms. Model performances were compared with multivariable logistic regression (MLR) by assessing C statistics and other prediction evaluation metrics. Among 6525 HCV-infected adults, 308 patients (4.7%) experienced DAA treatment failure. ML models performed similarly in predicting DAA treatment failure (C statistic [95% CI]: EN, 0.74 [0.69-0.79]; RF, 0.74 [0.69-0.80]; GBM, 0.72 [0.67-0.78]; FNN, 0.75 [0.70-0.80]), and all 4 outperformed MLR (C statistic [95% CI]: 0.51 [0.46-0.57]), and EN used the fewest predictors (n = 27). With Youden index, the EN had 58.4% sensitivity and 77.8% specificity, and nine patients were needed to evaluate to identify 1 DAA treatment failure. Over 60% treatment failure were classified in top three risk decile subgroups. EN-identified predictors included male sex, treatment < 8 weeks, treatment discontinuation due to adverse events, albumin level < 3.5 g/dL, total bilirubin level > 1.2 g/dL, advanced liver disease, and use of tobacco, alcohol, or vitamins. Addressing modifiable factors of DAA treatment failure may reduce the burden of retreatment. Machine learning algorithms have the potential to inform public health policies regarding curative treatment of HCV.

AB Access to behavior analytic services is limited and often unavailable for many in areas with a dearth of qualified providers. Tools to support behavior-change agents located in the natural environment of consumers may be a way to provide behavioral interventions. An artificial intelligence (AI) platform that guides the implementation of behavioral interventions may be useful for supporting procedural fidelity. The current studies evaluated whether an AI platform was effective at increasing and maintaining high levels of procedural fidelity in individuals with little to no prior training. Participants were two behavior technicians in training (Exp. 1) and three caregivers (Exp. 2). Introducing guidance provided by the AI platform GAINS improved the procedural fidelity with which behavior technicians and caregivers implemented behavioral interventions with children with autism, except for one caregiver. These results suggest AI platforms may be useful tools for supporting high levels of procedural fidelity by novice users.

AB Background: Dynamic radiographic measurements of 3-dimensional (3-D) total knee arthroplasty (TKA) kinematics have provided important information for implant design and surgical technique for over 30 years. However, current methods of measuring TKA kinematics are too cumbersome, inaccurate, or time-consuming for practical clinical application. Even state-of-the-art techniques require human-supervision to obtain clinically reliable kinematics. Eliminating human supervision could potentially make this technology practical for clinical use.Methods: We demonstrate a fully autonomous pipeline for quantifying 3D-TKA kinematics from single -plane radiographic imaging. First, a convolutional neural network (CNN) segmented the femoral and tibial implants from the image. Second, those segmented images were compared to precomputed shape libraries for initial pose estimates. Lastly, a numerical optimization routine aligned 3D implant contours and fluoroscopic images to obtain the final implant poses.Results: The autonomous technique reliably produces kinematic measurements comparable to human-supervised measures, with root-mean-squared differences of less than 0.7 mm and 4 degrees for our test data, and 0.8 mm and 1.7 degrees for external validation studies.Conclusion: A fully autonomous method to measure 3D-TKA kinematics from single-plane radiographic images produces results equivalent to a human-supervised method, and may soon make it practical to perform these measurements in a clinical setting.(c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB Procrastination behavior is quite ubiquitous, and should warrant cautions to us owing to its significant influences in poor mental health, low subjective well-beings and bad academic performance. However, how to identify this behavioral problem have not yet to be fully elucidated. 1132 participants were recruited as distribution of benchmark. 81 high trait procrastinators (HP) and matched low trait procrastinators (LP) were screened. To address this issue, we have built upon the hybrid brain model by using hierarchical machine learning techniques to classify HP and LP with multi-modalities neuroimaging data (i.e., grey matter volume, fractional anisotropy, static/dynamic amplitude of low frequency fluctuation and static/dynamic degree centrality). Further, we capitalized on the multiple Canonical Correlation Analysis (mCCA) and joint Independent Component Analysis algorithm (mCCA + jICA) to clarify its fusion neural components as well. The hybrid brain model showed high accuracy to discriminate HP and LP (accuracy rate = 87.04%, sensitivity rate = 86.42%, specificity rate = 85.19%). Moreover, results of mCCA + jICA model revealed several joint-discriminative neural independent components (ICs) of this classification, showing wider co-variants of frontoparietal cortex and hippocampus networks. In addition, this study demonstrated three modal-specific discriminative ICs for classification, highlighting the temporal variants of brain local and global natures in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and PHC in HP. To sum-up, this research developed a hybrid brain model to identify trait procrastination with high accuracy, and further revealed the neural hallmarks of this trait by integrating neuroimaging fusion data.

AB Pan and Wollack (PW) proposed a machine learning method to detect compromised items. We extend the work of PW to an approach detecting compromised items and examinees with item preknowledge simultaneously and draw on ideas in ensemble learning to relax several limitations in the work of PW. The suggested approach also provides a confidence score, which is based on an autoencoder to represent our confidence that the detection result truly corresponds to item preknowledge. Simulation studies indicate that the proposed approach performs well in the detection of item preknowledge, and the confidence score can provide helpful information for users.

AB Introduction Fornix deep brain stimulation (fx-DBS) is under investigation for treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated the anatomic correlates of flashback phenomena that were reported previously during acute diencephalic stimulation.
   Methods Thirty-nine patients with mild AD who took part in a prior fx-DBS trial (NCT01608061) were studied. After localizing patients' implanted electrodes and modeling the volume of tissue activated (VTA) by DBS during systematic stimulation testing, we performed (1) voxel-wise VTA mapping to identify flashback-associated zones; (2) machine learning-based prediction of flashback occurrence given VTA overlap with specific structures; (3) normative functional connectomics to define flashback-associated brain-wide networks.
   Results A distinct diencephalic region was associated with greater flashback likelihood. Fornix, bed nucleus of stria terminalis, and anterior commissure involvement predicted memory events with 72% accuracy. Flashback-inducing stimulation exhibited greater functional connectivity to a network of memory-evoking and autobiographical memory-related sites.
   Discussion These results clarify the neuroanatomical substrates of stimulation-evoked flashbacks.

AB Background: De-identification is a critical technology to facilitate the use of unstructured clinical text while protecting patient privacy and confidentiality. The clinical natural language processing (NLP) community has invested great efforts in developing methods and corpora for de-identification of clinical notes. These annotated corpora are valuable resources for developing automated systems to de-identify clinical text at local hospitals. However, existing studies often utilized training and test data collected from the same institution. There are few studies to explore automated de-identification under cross-institute settings. The goal of this study is to examine deep learning-based de-identification methods at a cross-institute setting, identify the bottlenecks, and provide potential solutions.
   Methods: We created a de-identification corpus using a total 500 clinical notes from the University of Florida (UF) Health, developed deep learning-based de-identification models using 2014 i2b2/UTHealth corpus, and evaluated the performance using UF corpus. We compared five different word embeddings trained from the general English text, clinical text, and biomedical literature, explored lexical and linguistic features, and compared two strategies to customize the deep learning models using UF notes and resources.
   Results: Pre-trained word embeddings using a general English corpus achieved better performance than embeddings from de-identified clinical text and biomedical literature. The performance of deep learning models trained using only i2b2 corpus significantly dropped (strict and relax F1 scores dropped from 0.9547 and 0.9646 to 0.8568 and 0.8958) when applied to another corpus annotated at UF Health. Linguistic features could further improve the performance of de-identification in cross-institute settings. After customizing the models using UF notes and resource, the best model achieved the strict and relaxed F1 scores of 0.9288 and 0.9584, respectively.
   Conclusions: It is necessary to customize de-identification models using local clinical text and other resources when applied in cross-institute settings. Fine-tuning is a potential solution to re-use pre-trained parameters and reduce the training time to customize deep learning-based de-identification models trained using clinical corpus from a different institution.

AB People now commonly interact with Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents. How do these interactions shape how humans perceive each other? In two preregistered studies (total N = 1,261), we show that people evaluate other humans more harshly after interacting with an AI (compared with an unrelated purported human). In Study 1, participants who worked on a creative task with AIs (versus purported humans) subsequently rated another purported human's work more negatively. Study 2 replicated this effect and demonstrated that the results hold even when participants believed their evaluation would not be shared with the purported human. Exploratory analyses of participants' conversations show that prior to their human evaluations they were more demanding, more instrumental and displayed less positive affect towards AIs (versus purported humans). These findings point to a potentially worrisome side effect of the exponential rise in human-AI interactions.

   METHODOLOGY
AB Time series of wetland methane fluxes measured by eddy covariance require gap-filling to estimate daily, seasonal, and annual emissions. Gap-filling methane fluxes is challenging because of high variability and complex responses to multiple drivers. To date, there is no widely established gap-filling standard for wetland methane fluxes, with regards both to the best model algorithms and predictors. This study synthesizes results of different gap-filling methods systematically applied at 17 wetland sites spanning boreal to tropical regions and including all major wetland classes and two rice paddies. Procedures are proposed for: 1) creating realistic artificial gap scenarios, 2) training and evaluating gap-filling models without overstating performance, and 3) predicting halfhourly methane fluxes and annual emissions with realistic uncertainty estimates. Performance is compared between a conventional method (marginal distribution sampling) and four machine learning algorithms. The conventional method achieved similar median performance as the machine learning models but was worse than the best machine learning models and relatively insensitive to predictor choices. Of the machine learning models, decision tree algorithms performed the best in cross-validation experiments, even with a baseline predictor set, and artificial neural networks showed comparable performance when using all predictors. Soil temperature was frequently the most important predictor whilst water table depth was important at sites with substantial water table fluctuations, highlighting the value of data on wetland soil conditions. Raw gap-filling uncertainties from the machine learning models were underestimated and we propose a method to calibrate uncertainties to observations. The python code for model development, evaluation, and uncertainty estimation is publicly available. This study outlines a modular and robust machine learning workflow and makes recommendations for, and evaluates an improved baseline of, methane gap-filling models that can be implemented in multi-site syntheses or standardized products from regional and global flux networks (e.g., FLUXNET).

TI Ethics of artificial intelligence in dermatology
SO CLINICS IN DERMATOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in dermatology holds promise for enhancing clinical accuracy, enabling earlier detection of skin malignancies, suggesting potential management of skin lesions and eruptions, and promoting improved continuity of care. AI implementation in dermatology, however, raises several ethical concerns. This review explores the current benefits and challenges associated with AI integration, underscoring ethical considerations related to autonomy, informed consent, and privacy. We also examine the ways in which beneficence, nonmaleficence, and distributive justice may be impacted. Clarifying the role of AI, striking a balance between security and transparency, fostering open dialogue with our patients, collaborating with developers of AI, implementing educational initiatives for dermatologists and their patients, and participating in the establishment of regulatory guidelines are essential to navigating ethical and responsible AI incorporation into dermatology.

AB Openly available community science digital vouchers provide a wealth of data to study phenotypic change across space and time. However, extracting phenotypic data from these resources requires significant human effort. Here, we demonstrate a workflow and computer vision model for automatically categorizing species color pattern from community science images. Our work is focused on documenting the striped/unstriped color polymorphism in the Eastern Red-backed Salamander (Plethodon cinereus). We used an ensemble convolutional neural network model to analyze this polymorphism in 20,318 iNaturalist images. Our model was highly accurate (similar to 98%) despite image heterogeneity. We used the resulting annotations to document extensive niche overlap between morphs, but wider niche breadth for striped morphs at the range-wide scale. Our work showcases key design principles for using machine learning with heterogeneous community science image data to address questions at an unprecedented scale.

AB Objective
   To compare performance of risk prediction models for forecasting postoperative sepsis and acute kidney injury.
   Design
   Retrospective single center cohort study of adult surgical patients admitted between 2000 and 2010.
   Patients
   50,318 adult patients undergoing major surgery.
   Measurements
   We evaluated the performance of logistic regression, generalized additive models, naive Bayes and support vector machines for forecasting postoperative sepsis and acute kidney injury. We assessed the impact of feature reduction techniques on predictive performance. Model performance was determined using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, and positive predicted value. The results were reported based on a 70/30 cross validation procedure where the data were randomly split into 70% used for training the model and the 30% for validation.
   Main Results
   The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for different models ranged between 0.797 and 0.858 for acute kidney injury and between 0.757 and 0.909 for severe sepsis. Logistic regression, generalized additive model, and support vector machines had better performance compared to Naive Bayes model. Generalized additive models additionally accounted for non-linearity of continuous clinical variables as depicted in their risk patterns plots. Reducing the input feature space with LASSO had minimal effect on prediction performance, while feature extraction using principal component analysis improved performance of the models.
   Conclusions
   Generalized additive models and support vector machines had good performance as risk prediction model for postoperative sepsis and AKI. Feature extraction using principal component analysis improved the predictive performance of all models.

AB This review describes the state-of-the-art in statistical, machine learning, and expert-advised computational methods for the evaluation and optimization of combination antiretroviral therapy, with respect to the virologic outcomes in HIV-1-infected patients. Currently employed methodologies are based on the paradigm for which mutations present in patient viral genotypes, selected either by treatment or already transmitted to the patient as resistant mutants, are the major drivers of virologic outcomes. Genotypic interpretation systems have been designed with the prime objective of characterizing the resistance to individual drugs, deriving scores from the association of viral genotypes with in vitro phenotypic drug susceptibility or in vivo response to treatment. Nevertheless, the very large range of possible drug combinations and of viral mutational patterns leads to an extremely complex scenario, making prediction of in vivo treatment response extremely challenging. To deal with such complexity, machine learning methods are being increasingly explored, thanks to the availability of exponentially growing HIV data bases in recent years. The combination of genotypic interpretation systems with other laboratory markers, treatment history, past clinical events, and the usage of data-driven techniques has dramatically raised the confidence in predicting virologic outcomes. A few of these systems have been implemented as free web-services, indicating ranks of suitable combination antiretroviral therapy regimens given a patient's clinical background. Future perspectives in the field foresee the extension of therapy optimization systems to newly approved antiretroviral drug targets and the prediction of other clinical outcomes, rather than the sole virologic response.

AB This paper proposes a data-driven model-free inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithm tailored for solving an inverse H-infinity control problem. In the problem, both an expert and a learner engage in H-infinity control to reject disturbances and the learner's objective is to imitate the expert's behavior by reconstructing the expert's performance function through IRL techniques. Introducing zero-sum game principles, we first formulate a model-based single-loop IRL policy iteration algorithm that includes three key steps: updating the policy, action, and performance function using a new correction formula and the standard inverse optimal control principles. Building upon the model-based approach, we propose a model-free single-loop off-policy IRL algorithm that eliminates the need for initial stabilizing policies and prior knowledge of the dynamics of expert and learner. Also, we provide rigorous proof of convergence, stability, and Nash optimality to guarantee the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed algorithms. Furthermore, we show-case the efficiency of our algorithm through simulations and experiments, highlighting its advantages compared to the existing methods.

AB Kinematic tracking of healthy joints in radiography sequences is frequently performed by maximizing similarities between computed perspective projections of 3D computer models and corresponding objects' appearances in radiographic images. Significant human effort associated with manual tracking presents a major bottleneck in biomechanics research methods and limits the scale of target applications. The current work introduces a method for fully-automatic tracking of tibiofemoral and patellofemoral kinematics in stereo-radiography sequences for subjects performing dynamic activities. The proposed method involves the application of convolutional neural networks for annotating radiographs and a multi-stage optimization pipeline for estimating bone pose based on information provided by neural net predictions. Predicted kinematics are evaluated by comparing against manually-tracked trends across 20 distinct trials. Median absolute differences below 1.5 millimeters or degrees for 6 tibiofemoral and 3 patellofemoral degrees of freedom demonstrate the utility of our approach, which improves upon previous semi-automatic methods by enabling end-to-end automation. Implementation of a fully automatic pipeline for kinematic tracking will benefit evaluation of human movement by enabling large-scale studies of healthy knee kinematics.

AB Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early diagnosis significantly improves the 5-year survival rate from 6% in patients with metastatic cancer to 60% in those with localized cancer. Histopathological examination is the gold standard for lung cancer diagnosis, but analyzing whole slide images (WSI) is time-consuming and prone to error for pathologists. This study aims to enhance the classification accuracy of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) histopathological images by proposing a novel deep-learning architecture that integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs). The model classifies NSCLC into three categories: normal, adenocarcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. CNNs are employed to capture local features, while ViTs are used to understand long-range relationships between image patches. We trained and validated our model on the LC25000 dataset, a benchmark dataset for NSCLC histopathology image classification. Our proposed model demonstrated superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 0.988, an F-1 score of 0.980, specificity of 0.991, recall of 0.982, and precision of 0.980, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, our model achieved a low inference time of 1.816 ms, highlighting its potential for real-world applications where both accuracy and speed are critical. Our code is now publicly availableat https://github.com/ImranNust/LungCancerDetection to facilitate further research and validation of ourfindings.

AB The use of machine learning technologies to process large quantities of remotely collected audio data is a powerful emerging research tool in ecology and conservation. We applied these methods to a field study of tinamou (Tinamidae) biology in Madre de Dios, Peru, a region expected to have high levels of interspecies competition and niche partitioning as a result of high tinamou alpha diversity. We used autonomous recording units to gather environmental audio over a period of several months at lowland rainforest sites in the Los Amigos Conservation Concession and developed a Convolutional Neural Network-based data processing pipeline to detect tinamou vocalizations in the dataset. The classified acoustic event data are comparable to similar metrics derived from an ongoing camera trapping survey at the same site, and it should be possible to combine the two datasets for future explorations of the target species' niche space parameters. Here, we provide an overview of the methodology used in the data collection and processing pipeline, offer general suggestions for processing large amounts of environmental audio data, and demonstrate how data collected in this manner can be used to answer questions about bird biology.

AB Timely detection and treatment of microaneurysms is a critical step to prevent the development of vision-threatening eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy. However, detecting microaneurysms in fundus images is a highly challenging task due to the low image contrast, misleading cues of other red lesions, and the large variation of imaging conditions. Existing methods tend to fail in face of the large intra-class variation and small inter-class variations for microaneurysm detection in fundus images. Recently, hybrid text/image mining computer-aided diagnosis systems have emerged to offer a promise of bridging the semantic gap between images and diagnostic information. In this paper, we focus on developing an interleaved deep mining technique to cope intelligently with the unbalanced microaneurysm detection problem. Specifically, we present a clinical report guided multi-sieving convolutional neural network, which leverages a small amount of supervised information in clinical reports to identify the potential microaneurysm regions via the image-to-text mapping in the feature space. These potential microaneurysm regions are then interleaved with fundus image information for multi-sieving deep mining in a highly unbalanced classification problem. Critically, the clinical reports are employed to bridge the semantic gap between low-level image features and high-level diagnostic information. We build an efficient microaneurysm detection framework based on the hybrid text/image interleaving and validate its performance on challenging clinical data sets acquired from diabetic retinopathy patients. Extensive evaluations are carried out in terms of fundus detection and classification. Experimental results show that our framework achieves 99.7% precision and 87.8% recall, comparing favorably with the state-of-the-art algorithms. Integration of expert domain knowledge and image information demonstrates the feasibility of reducing the difficulty of training classifiers under extremely unbalanced data distributions.

AB Psoriasis is an acute immuno-dermatological disease, affecting people of all ages, which significantly decreases quality of life. While the standard approach to identification and diagnosis of psoriasis is based on dermatologist decisions, various Deep Learning (DL) methods have been utilized to create Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems to detect and classify psoriasis cases. In response to the knowledge gap of an existing practical and functional DL-based solution to psoriasis diagnosis, this study proposed an ensemble Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using Residual Network 50 Version 2 (ResNet50V2), ResNet101V2, and ResNet152V2 networks to create a CAD system for detecting and classifying psoriatic images. This ensemble model determines whether an input image is psoriatic using a binary classification procedure in the initial stage and classifies the psoriatic images into seven variants utilizing a multi-class classification. Furthermore, a treatment suggestion system was embedded within the diagnostic algorithm to suggest the best treatment options for psoriasis variants using a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method with the aim of reducing the disease symptoms in patients. A web-based Decision and Diagnostic Support System (D&DSS) is constructed to determine whether an input image is psoriatic, classify the psoriatic images into different variants, and accordingly recommend the best treatment options based on the observed disease symptoms in a patient. Nevertheless, the functionality and reliability of the proposed D&DSS are validated with high accuracy rates in both diagnostic and identification stages of the approach, which ratifies the practicality of this proposition.

AB Deep hashing has attracted considerable attention to tackle large-scale retrieval tasks, because of automatic and powerful feature extraction of convolutional neural networks and the gain of hashing in computation and storage costs. Most current supervised deep hashing methods only utilize the semantic information of labeled data without exploiting unlabeled data. However, data annotation is expensive and thus only scarce labeled data are available, which are difficult to represent the true distribution of all data. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised deep pairwise hashing method to leverage both labeled and unlabeled data to learn hash functions. Our method utilizes the transduction of anchors to preserve the pairwise similarity relationship among both labeled and unlabeled samples. Additionally, to explore the semantic similarity information hidden in unlabeled data, it adopts self-ensembling to create strong ensemble targets for latent binary vectors of training samples and form a consensus predicting similarity relationship to multiple anchors. Unlike previous pairwise based hashing methods without maintaining the relevance among similar neighbors, we further explain and exhibit the capability of our method on preserving their relevance through calculating their similarities to anchors. Finally, extensive experiments on benchmark databases demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over recent state-of-the-art hashing methods on multiple retrieval tasks. The source codes of the proposed method are available on: .

AB In an effort to improve the efficiency of soil classification, traditional methods are being combined with analytical and computational techniques. This integration has strengthened the connection between conventional classification and the application of machine-learning (ML) models to interpret soil spectral reflectance data. Due to the time and computational cost, several studies are limited to testing the classification performance of a few algorithms and do not always explore the best parameters for model optimization. The study aims to assess the efficiency of combining soil spectral reflectance with prevalent ML models for classifying pedogenetic horizons and soil suborders, enhancing traditional classification methods. We collected seven soil monoliths, previously classified according to the Brazilian Soil Classification System (SiBCS) and soil taxonomy. Using the ASD Fieldspec spectroradiometer, we obtained spectral reflectance samples along each monolith (n = 800 per monolith) to classify horizons and n = 5600 for suborder classification. Spectral fingerprints were obtained and explored by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The spectral data were subdivided into training (70%) and test (30%) sets and submitted to the Logistic Regression (LR), Artificial Neural Network (NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting (GB) models for the classification of horizons and suborders, considering the model's adjustment parameters. Accuracy and F-Score were used to verify the performance of the models. There was a significant influence of particle size and soil organic carbon on the spectral fingerprint of the soils. The PCA indicated that topsoil horizons clustered in most of the monoliths analyzed, while most of the subsoil horizons showed data overlap. The NN model showed the highest accuracy in the classification of horizons (97%), while the SVM showed the lowest performance (52% accuracy). The classification of soil suborders presented accuracies between 95% and 98%. Therefore, our study concludes that spectral data combined with ML models can enhance the discrimination and classification of soil horizons and suborders, improving upon traditional methods.

AB With the increased restrictions on physical distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, remote proctoring has emerged as an alternative to traditional onsite proctoring to ensure the continuity of essential assessments, such as computer-based medical licensing exams. Recent literature has highlighted the significant impact of different proctoring modalities on examinees' test experience, including factors like response-time data. However, the potential influence of these differences on test performance has remained unclear. One limitation in the current literature is the lack of a rigorous learning analytics framework to evaluate the comparability of computer-based exams delivered using various proctoring settings. To address this gap, the current study aims to introduce a machine-learning-based framework that analyzes computer-generated response-time data to investigate the association between proctoring modalities in high-stakes assessments. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this framework using empirical data collected from a large-scale high-stakes medical licensing exam conducted in Canada. By applying the machine-learning-based framework, we were able to extract examinee-specific response-time data for each proctoring modality and identify distinct time-use patterns among examinees based on their proctoring modality.

AB Gravitational-wave astronomy is a vibrant field that leverages both classic and modern data processing techniques for the understanding of the Universe. Various approaches have been proposed for improving the efficiency of the detection scheme, with hierarchical matched filtering being an important strategy. Meanwhile, deep learning methods have recently demonstrated both consistency with matched filtering methods and remarkable statistical performance. In this work, we propose a hierarchical detection network (HDN), a novel approach to efficient detection that combines ideas from hierarchical matching and deep learning. The network is trained using a novel loss function, which encodes simultaneously the goals of statistical accuracy and efficiency. We discuss the source of complexity reduction of the proposed model and describe a general recipe for initialization with each layer specializing in different regions. We demonstrate the performance of the HDN with experiments using open LIGO data and synthetic injections, and observe with two-layer models a 79% efficiency gain compared with matched filtering at an equal error rate of 0.2%. Furthermore, we show how training a three-layer HDN initialized using a two-layer model can further boost both accuracy and efficiency, highlighting the power of multiple simple layers in efficient detection.

AB Predicting the critical temperature T-c of new superconductors is a notoriously difficult task, even for electron-phonon paired superconductors, for which the theory is relatively well understood. Early attempts to obtain a simple T-c formula consistent with strong-coupling theory, by McMillan and by Allen and Dynes, led to closed-form approximate relations between T-c and various measures of the phonon spectrum and the electron-phonon interaction appearing in Eliashberg theory. Here we propose that these approaches can be improved with the use of machine-learning algorithms. As an initial test, we train a model for identifying low-dimensional descriptors using the T-c < 10 K dataset by Allen and Dynes, and show that a simple analytical expression thus obtained improves upon the Allen-Dynes fit. Furthermore, the prediction for the recently discovered high-T-c material H3S at high pressure is quite reasonable. Interestingly, T-c's for more recently discovered superconducting systems with a more two-dimensional electron-phonon coupling, which do not follow Allen and Dynes's expression, also do not follow our analytic expression. Thus, this machine-learning approach appears to be a powerful method for highlighting the need for a new descriptor beyond those used by Allen and Dynes to describe their set of isotropic electron-phonon coupled superconductors. We argue that this machine-learning method, and its implied need for a descriptor characterizing Fermi-surface properties, represents a promising approach to superconductor materials discovery which may eventually replace the serendipitous discovery paradigm begun by Kamerlingh Onnes.

AB Background Accurate and repeatable measurement of high-grade glioma (HGG) enhancing (Enh.) and T2/FLAIR hyperintensity/edema (Ed.) is required for monitoring treatment response. 3D measurements can be used to inform the modified Response Assessment in Neuro-oncology criteria. We aim to develop an HGG volumetric measurement and visualization AI algorithm that is generalizable and repeatable. Methods A single 3D-Convoluted Neural Network, NS-HGlio, to analyze HGG on MRIs using 5-fold cross validation was developed using retrospective (557 MRIs), multicentre (38 sites) and multivendor (32 scanners) dataset divided into training (70%), validation (20%), and testing (10%). Six neuroradiologists created the ground truth (GT). Additional Internal validation (IV, three institutions) using 70 MRIs, and External validation (EV, single institution) using 40 MRIs through measuring the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of Enh., Ed. ,and Enh. + Ed. (WholeLesion/WL) tumor tissue and repeatability testing on 14 subjects from the TCIA MGH-QIN-GBM dataset using volume correlations between timepoints were performed. Results IV Preoperative median DSC Enh. 0.89 (SD 0.11), Ed. 0.88 (0.28), WL 0.88 (0.11). EV Preoperative median DSC Enh. 0.82 (0.09), Ed. 0.83 (0.11), WL 0.86 (0.06). IV Postoperative median DSC Enh. 0.77 (SD 0.20), Ed 0.78. (SD 0.09), WL 0.78 (SD 0.11). EV Postoperative median DSC Enh. 0.75 (0.21), Ed 0.74 (0.12), WL 0.79 (0.07). Repeatability testing; Intraclass Correlation Coefficient of 0.95 Enh. and 0.92 Ed. Conclusion NS-HGlio is accurate, repeatable, and generalizable. The output can be used for visualization, documentation, treatment response monitoring, radiation planning, intra-operative targeting, and estimation of Residual Tumor Volume among others.

AB The purpose of this research was to examine college students' conceptions of learning computer science and approaches to learning computer science and to examine the relationships among these two important constructs and possible moderating factors. Student data (N = 193) were collected using the conceptions of learning computer science and the approaches to learning computer science surveys at one public research institution in the southeastern United States. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, Confirmatory Factor Analysis models, internal consistency reliability, Pearson correlations, stepwise multiple regression models, and Multivariate Analysis of Variance models. The results suggest that college students most favorably employ a deep strategy approach for learning computer science in which prior knowledge is activated and meaningful learning strategies are used. College students appear to be more extrinsically motivated to learn computer science than intrinsically. Higher level learning conceptions are associated with a deep strategy approach to learning (e.g., Seeing in a new way) whereas low-level conceptions are associated with a surface strategy (e.g., Memorizing) approach to learning. Male college students have slightly higher conceptions of programming than their female counterparts. The findings are discussed and both limitations and delimitations of the study are enumerated.

AB 1. Remote sensing of forested landscapes can transform the speed, scale and cost of forest research. The delineation of individual trees in remote sensing images is an essential task in forest analysis. Here we introduce a new Python package, DeepForest that detects individual trees in high resolution RGB imagery using deep learning.
   2. While deep learning has proven highly effective in a range of computer vision tasks, it requires large amounts of training data that are typically difficult to obtain in ecological studies. DeepForest overcomes this limitation by including a model pretrained on over 30 million algorithmically generated crowns from 22 forests and fine-tuned using 10,000 hand-labelled crowns from six forests.
   3. The package supports the application of this general model to new data, fine tuning the model to new datasets with user labelled crowns, training new models and evaluating model predictions. This simplifies the process of using and retraining deep learning models for a range of forests, sensors and spatial resolutions.
   4. We illustrate the workflow of DeepForest using data from the National Ecological Observatory Network, a tropical forest in French Guiana, and street trees from Portland, Oregon.

AB Some recent studies have shown that machine learning can achieve higher predictive accuracy than logit models. However, existing studies rarely examine behavioral outputs (e.g., marginal effects and elasticities) that can be derived from machine-learning models and compare the results with those obtained from logit models. In other words, there has not been a comprehensive comparison between logit models and machine learning that covers both prediction and behavioral analysis, two equally important subjects in travel-behavior study. This paper addresses this gap by examining the key differences in model development, evaluation, and behavioral interpretation between logit and machine-learning models for mode-choice modeling. We empirically evaluate the two approaches using stated-preference survey data. Consistent with the literature, this paper finds that the best-performing machine-learning model, random forest, has significantly higher predictive accuracy than multi-nomial logit and mixed logit models. The random forest model and the two logit models largely agree on several aspects of the behavioral outputs, including variable importance and the direction of association between independent variables and mode choice. However, we find that the random forest model produces behaviorally unreasonable arc elasticities and marginal effects when these behavioral outputs are computed from a standard approach. After the introduction of some modifications that overcome the limitations of tree-based models, the results are improved to some extent. There appears to be a tradeoff between predictive accuracy and behavioral soundness when choosing between machine learning and logit models in mode-choice modeling.

AB There is a steadily increasing number of artificial intelligence (AI) tools available and cleared for use in clinical radiological practice. Radiologists will increasingly be faced with options provided by other radiologist colleagues, clinician colleagues, vendors, or other professionals for obtaining and deploying AI algorithms in clinical practice. It is important that radiologists are familiar with basic and practical aspects that need to be considered when assessing an AI tool for use in their practice, so that resources are properly allocated and there is an appropriate return on investment through enhancements in patient quality of care, safety, and/or process efficiency. In this review, we will discuss a potential approach for AI software assessment and practical points that should be considered when consider-ing the acquisition and deployment of an AI tool in the radiology department.Semin Roentgenology 58:208-213 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB The insufficiency of using only second-order statistics and premise of exploiting higher order statistics of the data has been well understood, and more advanced objectives including higher order statistics, especially those stemming from information theory, such as error entropy minimization, are now being studied and applied in many contexts of machine learning and signal processing. In the adaptive system training context, the main drawback of utilizing output error entropy as compared to correlation-estimation-based second-order statistics is the computational load of the entropy estimation, which is usually obtained via a plug-in kernel estimator. Sample-spacing estimates offer computationally inexpensive entropy estimators; however, resulting estimates are not differentiable, hence, not suitable for gradient-based adaptation. In this brief paper, we propose a nonparametric entropy estimator that captures the desirable properties of both approaches. The resulting estimator yields continuously differentiable estimates with a computational complexity at the order of those of the sample-spacing techniques. The proposed estimator is compared with the kernel density estimation (KDE)-based entropy estimator in the supervised neural network training framework with computation time and performance comparisons.

AB We present a high-throughput, material-agnostic strategy to discover new compositionally complex ceramics (C3) for extreme environments by utilizing machine learning (ML) techniques to predict the stoichiometries and properties of structures within a given design space. This example study focuses on a well-understood design space (Si-C-N) so that predictions may be validated. Evolutionary structure searches coupled with density functional theory (DFT) calculations are applied to find structures with low energies (i.e., lying on or close to the convex hull), while also maximizing a targeted property (in this case, hardness). The structure-property relationship data obtained throughout these searches are exploited in ML algorithms to create an accurate and efficient surrogate model of the energy and hardness landscapes. The ML models serve to screen structures with optimal attributes and reduce computational costs associated with the property calculations, thereby accelerating the discovery of new structures and stoichiometries with desired traits.

AB This study employs a systematic literature review (PRISMA methodology) to investigate the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in walkability assessments conducted between 2012 and 2022. Analyzing 34 articles exploring data types, factors, and AI tools, the review emphasizes the value of utilizing diverse datasets, particularly street view images, to train supersized AI models. This approach fosters efficient, unbiased assessments and offers deep insights into pedestrian environment interactions. Furthermore, AI tools empower walkability assessment by facilitating mapping, scoring, designing pedestrian routes, and uncovering previously unconsidered factors. The current shift from large-scale spatial data analysis (allocentric perspective) to a ground-level view (egocentric perspective) and physical and perceptual features of walking introduces a subjective lens into current walkability assessment tools. However, the efficacy of current methods in addressing non-visual aspects of human perception and their applicability across diverse demographics remains debatable. Finally, the lack of integration of emerging technologies like virtual/augmented reality and digital twin leaves a significant gap in research, inviting further study to determine their efficacy in enhancing the current methods and, in general, understanding the interaction of humans and cities.

ID FEATURE-EXTRACTION
AB In the fault diagnosis study, data deficiency, meaning that the fault data for the training are scarce, is often encountered, and it may deteriorate the performance of the fault diagnosis greatly. To solve this issue, the transfer learning (TL) approach is employed to exploit the neural network (NN) trained in another (source) domain where enough fault data are available in order to improve the NN performance of the real (target) domain. While there have been similar attempts of TL in the literature to solve the imbalance issue, they were about the sample imbalance between the source and target domain, whereas the present study considers the imbalance between the normal and fault data. To illustrate this, normal and fault datasets are acquired from the linear motion guide, in which the data at high and low speeds represent the real operation (target) and maintenance inspection (source), respectively. The effect of data deficiency is studied by reducing the number of fault data in the target domain, and comparing the performance of TL, which exploits the knowledge of the source domain and the ordinary machine learning (ML) approach without it. By examining the accuracy of the fault diagnosis as a function of imbalance ratio, it is found that the lower bound and interquartile range (IQR) of the accuracy are improved greatly by employing the TL approach. Therefore, it can be concluded that TL is truly more effective than the ordinary ML when there is a large imbalance between the fault and normal data, such as smaller than 0.1.

AB Deep-predictive-coding networks (DPCNs) are hierarchical, generative models. They rely on feed-forward and feedback connections to modulate latent feature representations of stimuli in a dynamic and context-sensitive manner. A crucial element of DPCNs is a forward-backward inference procedure to uncover sparse, invariant features. However, this inference is a major computational bottleneck. It severely limits the network depth due to learning stagnation. Here, we prove why this bottleneck occurs. We then propose a new forward-inference strategy based on accelerated proximal gradients. This strategy has faster theoretical convergence guarantees than the one used for DPCNs. It overcomes learning stagnation. We also demonstrate that it permits constructing deep and wide predictive-coding networks. Such convolutional networks implement receptive fields that capture well the entire classes of objects on which the networks are trained. This improves the feature representations compared with our lab's previous nonconvolutional and convolutional DPCNs. It yields unsupervised object recognition that surpass convolutional autoencoders and is on par with convolutional networks trained in a supervised manner.

AB Dynamic cache reconfiguration (DCR) is an effective technique to optimize energy consumption inmany-core architectures. While early work on DCR has shown promising energy saving opportunities, prior techniques are not suitable for many-core architectures since they do not consider the interactions and tight coupling between memory, caches, and network-on-chip (NoC) traffic. In this article, we propose an efficient cache reconfiguration framework in NoC-based many-core architectures. The proposed work makes three major contributions. First, we model a distributed directory based many-core architecture similar to Intel Xeon Phi architecture. Next, we propose an efficient cache reconfiguration framework that considers all significant components, including NoC, caches, and main memory. Finally, we propose a machine learning-based framework that can reduce the exploration time by an order of magnitude with negligible loss in accuracy. Our experimental results demonstrate 18.5% energy savings on average compared to base cache configuration.

AB Speed binning of system-on-chips (SoCs) using conventional F-max test requires application of complex functional test patterns. Functional workload-based speed binning techniques incur high test-cost in terms of long test-time and complexity in functional test generation, and require high-end automatic test equipment. In this paper, we propose a novel speed binning flow that uses path timing slacks, extracted with robust digital embedded sensor IPs, of selected critical/nearcritical paths. We apply machine learning techniques to model a predictor considering the extracted slacks and the Fmax values from a set of randomly tested die during wafer sort. The trained predictor is used to obtain the Fmax for the remaining chips. The proposed flow has been demonstrated in an SoC benchmark circuit at 28 nm technology. For sufficient number of training samples, F-max is correctly predicted for 99% of the prediction samples.

AB This qualitative study explores the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and internal communication, investigating AI applications, challenges, and best practices. In-depth interviews with 20 senior communication professionals examined perceptions of AI's impact on internal communication processes and outcomes. Key findings indicate AI improves internal communication efficiency, information flow, listening capability, and employee experience. However, challenges include lack of AI knowledge among employees, fears about job security andbias, and concerns about authenticity loss. To enable effective AI adoption for internal communication, organizations need education and training, a "co-piloting" approach between humans and machines, transparent communication, ethical governance, and an open culture of experimentation. This research makes important theoretical contributions by illuminating AI's transformative potential for internal communication. It also offers practical insights to guide organizations in strategically leveraging AI to elevate internal communication.

AB The integration of multiple predictors promises higher prediction accuracy than the accuracy that can be obtained with a single predictor. The challenge is how to select the best predictor at any given moment. Traditionally, multiple predictors are run in parallel and the one that generates the best result is selected for prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for predictor integration based on the learning of historical predictions. Compared with the traditional approach, it does not require running all the predictors simultaneously. Instead, it uses classification algorithms such as k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) and Bayesian classification and dimension reduction technique such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to forecast the best predictor for the workload under study based on the learning of historical predictions. Then only the forecasted best predictor is run for prediction. Our experimental results show that it achieved 20.18% higher best predictor forecasting accuracy than the cumulative MSE based predictor selection approach used in the popular Network Weather Service system. In addition, it outperformed the observed most accurate single predictor in the pool for 44.23% of the performance traces.

AB Modern embedded systems and Internet of Things (IoT) devices contain system-on-chips (SoCs) as their hardware backbone, which increasingly contain many critical assets (secure communication keys, configuration bits, firmware, sensitive data, etc.). These critical assets must be protected against wide array of potential vulnerabilities to uphold the system's confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Today's SoC designs contain diverse intellectual property (IP) blocks, often acquired from multiple 3rd-party IP vendors. Secure hardware design using them inevitably relies on the accrued domain knowledge of well-trained security experts. In this letter, we introduce SPELL, a novel end-to-end framework for the automated development of secure SoC designs. It leverages conversational large language models (LLMs) to automatically identify security vulnerabilities in a target SoC and map them to the evolving database of common weakness enumerations (CWEs); SPELL then filters the relevant CWEs, subsequently converting them to systemverilog assertions (SVAs) for verification; and finally, addresses the vulnerabilities via centralized security policy enforcement. We have implemented the SPELL framework using popular LLMs, such as ChatGPT and GEMINI, to analyze their efficacy in generating appropriate CWEs from user-defined SoC specifications and implement corresponding security policies for an open-source SoC benchmark. We have also explored the limitations of existing pretrained conversational LLMs in this context.

AB As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more seamlessly integrated into our social life, the unfair outcomes and ethical issues associated with AI and its subtechnologies have been widely discussed in scholarly work across disciplines in recent years. This study provides an overview of the conceptualization, empirical scholarship, and ethical concerns related to algorithmic bias across diverse disciplines. In doing so, the study relies on the framework of AI-mediated communication and human-AI communication, as well as topic modeling and semantic network analysis to examine the conceptualization and major thematic areas of AI bias literature. The study reveals the complexity of the concept of algorithmic bias, which extends beyond the algorithm itself. Empirical scholarship on AI and algorithmic bias revolves around conceptualizations, human perceptions, algorithm optimization, practical applications, and ethics and policy implications. Understanding and addressing the ethical challenges require a multilevel examination from the perspectives of different stakeholders. Theoretical and practical implications are further discussed in the context of AI and algorithmic justice.

AB Real industrial processes usually are equipped with onboard control or diagnostic systems and limit to store a complicated model. Also, measurement samples from real processes are contaminated with noises of different statistical characteristics and are produced by one-by-one way. In this case, learning algorithms with better learning performance and compact model for systems with noises of various statistics are necessary. This paper proposes a new online extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm, namely, sparse recursive least mean p-power ELM (SRLMP-ELM). In SRLMP-ELM, a novel cost function, i.e., the sparse least mean p-power (SLMP) error criterion, provides a mechanism to update the output weights sequentially and automatically tune some parameters of the output weights to zeros. The SLMP error criterion aims to minimize the combination of the mean p-power of the errors and a sparsity penalty constraint of the output weights. For real industrial system requirements, the proposed on-line learning algorithm is able to provide more higher accuracy, compact model, and better generalization ability than ELM and online sequential ELM, whereas the non-Gaussian noises impact the processes, especially impulsive noises. Simulations are reported to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed methods.

AB Like other components of the nuclear fuel cycle, fresh nuclear fuel has potential safeguard and security concerns. Non-destructive assay (NDA) measurements need to be examined and made available to nuclear industry partners to decrease safeguard and oversight concerns for nuclear power plants and facilities. This study analyzed four proposed evaluation criteria: quantity of detectors required, speed and accuracy of detector verification, overall efficiency of neutron and gamma detections, and suitability of observables to advanced machine learning algorithms. Four different detectors have been arranged to be evaluated simultaneously: four Saint-Gobain 3 He proportional counters, an Eljen EJ-309 liquid scintillator, a Saint-Gobain / Bicron NaI(Tl) scintillation detector, and a Cs2LiYCl6:Ce3+(CLYC) scintillation detector. Mock-up BWR and PWR fresh fuel configurations were developed by creating 4x4 and 3x3 natural uranium assemblies and aided in assessments for detector configurations. Additionally, 252 Cf was included to increase the number of neutrons for evaluation. The results of this work will be used to develop a versatile, multi-detector system for fresh fuel verification. The exploration of detector types, data modalities, and their significance as input for advanced machine learning and data analysis algorithms is being explored to understand the obstacles and opportunities in the development of a consolidated low-cost, commercial-off-the-shelf system that nuclear power plants, facilities, and/or inspectors can use for nondestructive verification of fresh nuclear fuel and assembly templating for quick nuclear material inventory verification.

AB An infinite horizon optimal regulation problem is solved online for a deterministic control-affine nonlinear dynamical system using a state following (StaF) kernel method to approximate the value function. Unlike traditional methods that aim to approximate a function over a large compact set, the StaF kernel method aims to approximate a function in a small neighborhood of a state that travels within a compact set. Simulation results demonstrate that stability and approximate optimality of the control system can be achieved with significantly fewer basis functions than may be required for global approximation methods.

AB Objective: Nucleus recognition is a critical yet challenging step in histopathology image analysis, for example, in Ki67 immunohistochemistry stained images. Although many automated methods have been proposed, most use a multi-stage processing pipeline to categorize nuclei, leading to cumbersome, low-throughput, and error-prone assessments. To address this issue, we propose a novel deep fully convolutional network for single-stage nucleus recognition. Methods: Instead of conducting direct pixel-wise classification, we formulate nucleus identification as a deep structured regression model. For each input image, it produces multiple proximity maps, each of which corresponds to one nucleus category and exhibits strong responses in central regions of the nuclei. In addition, by taking into consideration the nucleus distribution in histopathology images, we further introduce an auxiliary task, region of interest (ROI) extraction, to assist and boost the nucleus quantification with weak ROI annotation. The proposed network can be learned in an end-to-end, pixel-to-pixel manner for simultaneous nucleus detection and classification. Results: We have evaluated this network on a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor Ki67 image dataset, and the experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art approaches. Conclusion: We present a new, pixel-to-pixel deep neural network with two sibling branches for effective nucleus recognition and observe that learning with another relevant task, ROI extraction, can further boost individual nucleus localization and classification. Significance: Our method provides a clean, single-stage nucleus recognition pipeline for histopathology image analysis, especially a new perspective for Ki67 image quantification, which would potentially benefit individual object quantification in whole-slide images.

AB This paper addresses a serial-batching scheduling problem where the jobs with arbitrary release times are scheduled on parallel machines with the objective to minimize the makespan. The effects of learning and deterioration are considered simultaneously, and each job's actual processing time depends on the sum of previous jobs' processing times and the position of the current job. Each machine can process up to c jobs in the manner of serial batch, i.e., one after another with a setup time for each batch. Structural properties are identified for the special cases of the studied problem. Based on these derived structural properties, we propose a novel hybrid SC-VNS algorithm to solve the studied problem, which combines Society and Civilization (SC) algorithm with Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS). Computational experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed hybrid algorithm and some other well-known algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid SC-VNS algorithm performs quite better than the compared algorithms in terms of the solution quality and the required running time.

AB (Aim) To make a more accurate and precise COVID-19 diagnosis system, this study proposed a novel deep rank-based average pooling network (DRAPNet) model, i.e., deep rank-based average pooling network, for COVID-19 recognition. (Methods) 521 subjects yield 1164 slice images via the slice level selection method. All the 1164 slice images comprise four categories: COVID-19 positive; community-acquired pneumonia; second pulmonary tuberculosis; and healthy control. Our method firstly introduced an improved multiple-way data augmentation. Secondly, an n-cony rank-based average pooling module (NRAPM) was proposed in which rank-based pooling-particularly, rank-based average pooling (RAP)-was employed to avoid overfitting. Third, a novel DRAPNet was proposed based on NRAPM and inspired by the VGG network. Grad-CAM was used to generate heatmaps and gave our AI model an explainable analysis. (Results) Our DRAPNet achieved a micro-averaged F1 score of 95.49% by 10 runs over the test set. The sensitivities of the four classes were 95.44%, 96.07%, 94.41%, and 96.07%, respectively. The precisions of four classes were 96.45%, 95.22%, 95.05%, and 95.28%, respectively. The F1 scores of the four classes were 95.94%, 95.64%, 94.73%, and 95.67%, respectively. Besides, the confusion matrix was given. (Conclusions) The DRAPNet is effective in diagnosing COVID-19 and other chest infectious diseases. The RAP gives better results than four other methods: strided convolution, l(2)-norm pooling, average pooling, and max pooling.

AB Automatic differentiation of benign and malignant mammography images is a challenging task. Recently, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been proposed to address this task based on raw pixel input. However, these CNN-based methods are unable to exploit information from multiple sources, e.g., multi view image and clinical data. A hybrid deep network framework is presented in this paper, aiming to efficiently integrate and exploit information from multi-view data for breast mass classification. Starting from a generic CNN for feature extraction and assuming a multi-view setup, an attention-based network is used to automatically select the informative features of breast mass. The attention mechanism attempts to make CNN focus on the semantic-related regions for a more interpretable classification result. Then, mass features from multi-view data are effectively aggregated by a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). In contrast to previous works, the proposed framework learns the attention-driven features of CNN as well as the semantic label dependency among different views. We justify the proposed framework through extensive experiments on the BCDR data set and quantitative comparisons against other methods. We achieve a good performance in terms of ACC (0.85) and AIJC (0.89). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE Colorectal cancer; MiRNA-mRNA; Protein Language Model; Graph neural

AB Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most diagnosed cancer and the second deadliest cancer worldwide representing a major public health problem. In recent years, increasing evidence has shown that microRNA (miRNA) can control the expression of targeted human messenger RNA (mRNA) by reducing their abundance or translation, acting as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in various cancers, including CRC. Due to the significant upregulation of oncogenic miRNAs in CRC, elucidating the underlying mechanism and identifying dysregulated miRNA targets may provide a basis for improving current therapeutic interventions. In this paper, we proposed Gra-CRC-miRTar, a pre-trained nucleotide-to-graph neural network framework, for identifying potential miRNA targets in CRC. Different from previous studies, we constructed two pre-trained models to encode RNA sequences and transformed them into de Bruijn graphs. We employed different graph neural networks to learn the latent representations. The embeddings generated from de Bruijn graphs were then fed into a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to perform the prediction tasks. Our extensive experiments show that Gra-CRC-miRTar achieves better performance than other deep learning algorithms and existing predictors. In addition, our analyses also successfully revealed 172 out of 201 functional interactions through experimentally validated miRNA-mRNA pairs in CRC. Collectively, our effort provides an accurate and efficient framework to identify potential miRNA targets in CRC, which can also be used to reveal miRNA target interactions in other malignancies, facilitating the development of novel therapeutics.

AB Supply chain vulnerability provides the opportunity for the attackers to implant hardware Trojans in System-on-Chip (SoC) designs. While machine learning (ML) based Trojan detection is promising, it suffers from three practical limitations: 1) golden model may not be available; 2) lack of human expertise for Trojan feature selection; and 3) limited learning transferability can lead to unacceptable performance in new benchmarks with unseen Trojans. While recent approach based on transfer learning addresses some of these concerns, it still requires retraining for fine-tuning the model using domain-specific (e.g., hardware Trojan features) knowledge. In this article, we propose a Trojan detection framework utilizing zero-shot learning to address the above challenges. The proposed framework adopts the idea of self-supervised learning, where a pretrained graph convolutional network (GCN) is utilized to extract underlined common sense about hardware Trojans, and a metric learning task is used to measure the similarity between test inputs and malicious samples to make classification. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach has four major advantages compared to state-of-the-art techniques: 1) does not require any golden model during Trojan detection; 2) can handle both unknown Trojans and unseen benchmarks without any changes to the network; 3) drastic reduction in training time; and 4) significant improvement in detection efficiency (10.5% on average).

AB Background/objectives: The inherently immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment along with the heterogeneity of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) limits the effectiveness of available treatment options and contributes to the disease lethality. Using a machine learning algorithm, we hypothesized that PDAC may be categorized based on its microenvironment inflammatory milieu. Methods: Fifty-nine tumor samples from patients naive to treatment were homogenized and probed for 41 unique inflammatory proteins using a multiplex assay. Subtype clustering was determined using tdistributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) machine learning analysis of cytokine/chemokine levels. Statistics were performed using Wilcoxon rank sum test and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Results: t-SNE analysis of tumor cytokines/chemokines revealed two distinct clusters, immunomodulating and immunostimulating. In pancreatic head tumors, patients in the immunostimulating group (N = 26) were more likely to be diabetic (p = 0.027), but experienced less intraoperative blood loss (p = 0.0008). Though there were no significant differences in survival (p = 0.161), the immunostimulating group trended toward longer median survival by 9.205 months (11.28 vs. 20.48 months). Conclusion: A machine learning algorithm identified two distinct subtypes within the PDAC inflammatory milieu, which may influence diabetes status as well as intraoperative blood loss. Opportunity exists to further explore how these inflammatory subtypes may influence treatment response, potentially elucidating targetable mechanisms of PDAC's immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment.

AB Background: Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a critical public health crisis in the United States, affecting >5.5 million Americans in 2021. Machine learning has been used to predict patient risk of incident OUD. However, little is known about the fairness and bias of these predictive models. Objective: The aims of this study are two-fold: (1) to develop a machine learning bias mitigation algorithm for sociodemographic features and (2) to develop a fairness-aware weighted majority voting (WMV) classifier for OUD prediction. Methods: We used the 2020 National Survey on Drug and Health data to develop a neural network (NN) model using stochastic gradient descent (SGD; NN-SGD) and an NN model using Adam (NN-Adam) optimizers and evaluated sociodemographic bias by comparing the area under the curve values. A bias mitigation algorithm, based on equality of odds, was implemented to minimize disparities in specificity and recall. Finally, a WMV classifier was developed for fairness-aware prediction of OUD. To further analyze bias detection and mitigation, we did a 1-N matching of OUD to non-OUD cases, controlling for socioeconomic variables, and evaluated the performance of the proposed bias mitigation algorithm and WMV classifier. Results: Our bias mitigation algorithm substantially reduced bias with NN-SGD, by 21.66% for sex, 1.48% for race, and 21.04% for income, and with NN-Adam by 16.96% for sex, 8.87% for marital status, 8.45% for working condition, and 41.62% for race. The fairness-aware WMV classifier achieved a recall of 85.37% and 92.68% and an accuracy of 58.85% and 90.21% using NN-SGD and NN-Adam, respectively. The results after matching also indicated remarkable bias reduction with NN-SGD and NN-Adam, respectively, as follows: sex (0.14% vs 0.97%), marital status (12.95% vs 10.33%), working condition (14.79% vs 15.33%), race (60.13% vs 41.71%), and income (0.35% vs 2.21%). Moreover, the fairness-aware WMV classifier achieved high performance with a recall of 100% and 85.37% and an accuracy of 73.20% and 89.38% using NN-SGD and NN-Adam, respectively. Conclusions: The application of the proposed bias mitigation algorithm shows promise in reducing sociodemographic bias, with the WMV classifier confirming bias reduction and high performance in OUD prediction.

AB Traffic measurement is the bedrock of the next-generation network systems. While it plays a crucial role in bringing fundamental data and support to core network functions, it also confronts the challenge of meeting the diverse demands of new network traffic characteristics and emerging applications. The network-wide measurement has received more and more attention. Given that big network data is distributed in nature, it is essential to aggregate the views of multiple measurement points to build a network-wide perception of traffic. Another latest trend involves artificial intelligence technologies that allow seamless aggregation of multifaceted network traffic data to advance traffic data analysis and support related applications. Nonetheless, a gap remains in existing methodologies, which often fail to fully address the diverse demands of network traffic measurement in this evolving landscape.

ID PRECISION AGRICULTURE; STRESS
AB Fusarium ear rot (FER) is a common disease in maize caused by the pathogen Fusarium verticillioides. Because of the quantitative nature of the disease, scoring disease severity is difficult and nuanced, relying on various ways to quantify the damage caused by the pathogen. Towards the goal of designing a system with greater objectivity, reproducibility, and accuracy than subjective scores or estimations of the infected area, a system of semi-automated image acquisition and subsequent image analysis was designed. The tool created for image acquisition, "The Ear Unwrapper", successfully obtained images of the full exterior of maize ears. A set of images produced from The Ear Unwrapper was then used as an example of how machine learning could be used to estimate disease severity from unannotated images. A high correlation (0.74) was found between the methods estimating the area of disease, but low correlations (0.47 and 0.28) were found between the number of infected kernels and the area of disease, indicating how different methods can result in contrasting severity scores. This study provides an example of how a simplified image acquisition tool can be built and incorporated into a machine learning pipeline to measure phenotypes of interest. We also present how the use of machine learning in image analysis can be adapted from open-source software to estimate complex phenotypes such as Fusarium ear rot.

AB Feature selection is an important component of machine learning for researchers that are confronted with high dimensional data. In the field of economics, researchers are often faced with high dimensional data, particularly in the studies that aim to understand the channels through which climate change affects the welfare of countries. This work reviews the current literature that introduces various feature selection algorithms that may be useful for applications in this area of study. The article first outlines the specific problems that researchers face in understanding the effects of climate change on countries' macroeconomic outcomes, and then provides a discussion regarding different categories of feature selection. Emphasis is placed on two main feature selection algorithms: Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator and causality-based feature selection. I demonstrate an application of feature selection to discover the optimal heatwave definition for economic outcomes, enhancing our understanding of extreme temperatures' impact on the economy. I argue that the literature in computer science can provide useful insights in studies concerned with climate change as well as its economic outcomes.

ID PUFS
AB As PUFs become ubiquitous for commercial products (e.g., FPGAs from Xilinx, Altera, and Microsemi), attacks against these primitives are evolving toward more omnipresent and even advanced techniques. Machine learning (ML) attacks, among other non-invasive attacks, are proven to be feasible and cost-effective in the real-world. However, for PUF designers, it still remains an open question whether their countermeasures, or even new designs, are resistant to these types of attacks. Although standard metrics for estimating PUF quality exist, the most common approaches for measuring resistance to ML attacks are empirical. This paper introduces PUFmeter, a new publicly available toolbox consisting of in-house developed algorithms, to provide a firm basis for the robustness assessment of PUFs against ML attacks. To this end, new metrics and notions are reintroduced by PUFmeter to PUF designers and manufacturers. Furthermore, to prepare the PUF input-output pairs adequately before conducting any analysis, PUFmeter involves modules that output the minimum number of measurement repetitions and the upper bound on the noise level affecting the PUF responses.

AB This paper discusses a framework for learning based on information theoretic criteria. A novel algorithm based on Renyi's quadratic entropy is used to train, directly from a data set, linear or nonlinear mappers for entropy maximization or minimization. We provide an intriguing analogy between the computation and an information potential measuring the interactions among the data samples. We also propose two approximations to the Kulback-Leibler divergence based on quadratic distances (Cauchy-Schwartz inequality and Euclidean distance). These distances can still be computed using the information potential. We test the newly proposed distances in blind source separation (unsupervised learning) and in feature extraction for classification (supervised learning). In blind source separation our algorithm is capable of separating instantaneously mixed sources, and for classification the performance of our classifier is comparable to the support vector machines (SVMs).

AB Background: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in psychiatry presents opportunities for enhancing patient care but raises significant ethical concerns and challenges in clinical application. Addressing these challenges necessitates an informed and ethically aware psychiatric workforce capable of integrating AI into practice responsibly. Methods: A mixed-methods study was conducted to assess the outcomes of the "CONNECT with AI" - (Collaborative Opportunity to Navigate and Negotiate Ethical Challenges and Trials with Artificial Intelligence) workshop, aimed at exploring AI's ethical implications and applications in psychiatry. This workshop featured presentations, discussions, and scenario analyses focusing on AI's role in mental health care. Pre- and postworkshop questionnaires and focus group discussions evaluated participants' perspectives, and ethical understanding regarding AI in psychiatry. Results: Participants exhibited a cautious optimism towards AI, recognizing its potential to augment mental health care while expressing concerns over ethical usage, patient-doctor relationships, and AI's practical application in patient care. The workshop significantly improved participants' ethical understanding, highlighting a substantial knowledge gap and the need for further education in AI among psychiatrists. Conclusion: The study underscores the necessity of continuous education and ethical guideline development for psychiatrists in the era of AI, emphasizing collaborative efforts in AI system design to ensure they meet clinical needs ethically and effectively. Future initiatives should aim to broaden psychiatrists' exposure to AI, fostering a deeper understanding and integration of AI technologies in psychiatric practice.

AB Purpose Despite being the standard metric in patient-specific quality assurance (QA) for intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), gamma analysis has two shortcomings: (a) it lacks sensitivity to small but clinically relevant errors (b) it does not provide efficient means to classify the error sources. The purpose of this work is to propose a dual neural network method to achieve simultaneous error detection and classification in patient-specific IMRT QA. Methods For a pair of dose distributions, we extracted the dose difference histogram (DDH) for the low dose gradient region and two signed distance-to-agreement (sDTA) maps (one in x direction and one in y direction) for the high dose gradient region. An artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) were designed to analyze the DDH and the two sDTA maps, respectively. The ANN was trained to detect and classify six classes of dosimetric errors: incorrect multileaf collimator (MLC) transmission (+/- 1%) and four types of monitor unit (MU) scaling errors (+/- 1% and +/- 2%). The CNN was trained to detect and classify seven classes of spatial errors: incorrect effective source size, 1 mm MLC leaf bank overtravel or undertravel, 2 mm single MLC leaf overtravel or undertravel, and device misalignment errors (1 mm in x- or y direction). An in-house planar dose calculation software was used to simulate measurements with errors and noise introduced. Both networks were trained and validated with 13 IMRT plans (totaling 88 fields). A fivefold cross-validation technique was used to evaluate their accuracy. Results Distinct features were found in the DDH and the sDTA maps. The ANN perfectly identified all four types of MU scaling errors and the specific accuracies for the classes of no error, MLC transmission increase, MLC transmission decrease were 98.9%, 96.6%, and 94.3%, respectively. For the CNN, the largest confusion occurred between the 1-mm-MLC bank overtravel class and the 1-mm-device alignment error in x-direction class, which brought the specific accuracies down to 90.9% and 92.0%, respectively. The specific accuracy for the 2-mm-single MLC leaf undertravel class was 93.2% as it misclassified 5.7% of the class as being error free (false negative). Otherwise, the specific accuracy was above 95%. The overall accuracies across the fivefold were 98.3 +/- 0.7% and 95.6% +/- 1.5% for the ANN and the CNN, respectively. Conclusions Both the DDH and the sDTA maps are suitable features for error classification in IMRT QA. The proposed dual neural network method achieved simultaneous error detection and classification with excellent accuracy. It could be used in complement with the gamma analysis to potentially shift the IMRT QA paradigm from passive pass/fail analysis to active error detection and root cause identification.

AB The introduction of computerized formative assessments in the classroom has opened a new area of effective progress monitoring with more accessible test administrations. With computerized formative assessments, all students could be tested at the same time and with the same number of test administrations within a school year. Alternatively, the decision for the number and frequency of such tests could be made by teachers based on their observations and personal judgments about students. However, this often results in rigid test scheduling that fails to take into account the pace at which students acquire knowledge. To administer computerized formative assessments efficiently, teachers should be provided with systematic guidance regarding effective test scheduling based on each student's level of progress. In this study, we introduce an intelligent recommendation system that can gauge the optimal number and timing of testing for each student. We discuss how to build an intelligent recommendation system using a reinforcement learning approach. Then, we present a case study with a large sample of students' test results in a computerized formative assessment. We show that the intelligent recommendation system can significantly reduce the number of testing for the students by eliminating unnecessary test administrations where students do not show significant progress (i.e., growth). Also, the proposed recommendation system is capable of identifying the optimal test time for students to demonstrate adequate progress from one test administration to another. Implications for future research on personalized assessment scheduling are discussed.

AB Purpose: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP) are devastating dis-eases in preterm neonates, often requiring surgical treatment. Previous studies evaluated outcomes in peritoneal drain placement versus laparotomy, but the accuracy of the presumptive diagnosis remains unknown without bowel visualization. Predictive analytics provide the opportunity to determine the eti-ology of perforation and guide surgical decision making. The purpose of this investigation was to build and evaluate machine learning models to differentiate NEC and SIP. Methods: Neonates who underwent drain placement or laparotomy NEC or SIP were identified and grouped definitively via bowel visualization. Patient characteristics were analyzed using machine learn-ing methodologies, which were optimized through areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The model was further evaluated using a validation cohort. Results: 40 patients were identified. A random forest model achieved 98% AUROC while a ridge logis-tic regression model reached 92% AUROC in differentiating diseases. When applying the trained random forest model to the validation cohort, outcomes were correctly predicted. Conclusions: This study supports the feasibility of using a novel machine learning model to differentiate between NEC and SIP prior to any intended surgical interventions.

AB Improving fruit quality is important to wild blueberry producers. Plant debris like leaves and stems caused a reduction in fruit quality during mechanical harvesting. A debris detection system was developed using two Logitech C920 webcam cameras mounted before and after the blower fan on a commercial mechanical wild blueberry harvester. Images were collected from two commercially managed wild blueberry fields located in central Nova Scotia to develop a dataset of 1000 images. Two convolutional neural networks (CNNs), YOLOv3 and YOLOv3-SPP, were used and compared for performance analysis. The CNNs were trained using no augmented images, images with five augmentations (sharpening, brightness, contrast, gamma correction, and saturation), and images with five augmentations that were more heavily weighted towards gamma. Four different computer hardware packages (Hewlett-Packard, Shuttle XPC, Jetson TX2, and GPU-based Desktop) were used to determine the appropriate hardware and CNN model combination for real-time performance. YOLOv3 and YOLOv3-SPP were trained to mAP scores of 72.87 and 74.38% using the dataset with more gamma-augmented images. This was an improvement over the dataset with no augmentation (67.75; 68.49%) and equally numbered augmentations (71.26%; 73.03%). YOLOv3-SPP combined with an Intel (R) CoreTM i9-7900X CPU and Nvidia GeForce RTXTM 2080 Ti GPU in a desktop computer achieved the fastest detection rate of 33.30 ms. The detection speed on all other hardware configurations exceeded 33.30 ms, indicating that a powerful desktop GPU is required for real-time performance of this task. With adequate processing hardware, the developed technology could be integrated into a control system to automatically adjust brushes based on conveyor information from mechanical wild blueberry harvesters to make cleaning berries easier and enhance fruit quality.

AB Soil salinity poses a global threat to crop production. Early understanding of plant physiological responses to salinity stress can be critical to implementing timely stress management strategies. One of the initial plant physiological responses to salinity is a reduction of transpiration. This study used papaya as a model crop to better understand the effect of salinity on whole-plant transpiration using a greenhouse experiment. Treatments consisted of four electrical conductivity (EC_IR) levels of irrigation water: similar to 0 (tap water), 2, 4, or 8 dS m(- 1) were considered for the experiment. An automated phenotyping platform measured whole plant transpiration from the time of papaya transplanting until they reached approximately 15 weeks of age. Five machine learning models: extreme gradient boosting (XGBt), categorical boosting (CATBt), light gradient boosting (LAGBt), random forest (RF), and decision tree (DT) were fitted to the transpiration data and machine learning algorithms were deployed on a new data set. The impact of salinity on transpiration started to become evident 16 days after initiation of salinity treatments, where only the 8 dS m(- 1) treatment induced a significant decline in transpiration. All machine learning models efficiently captured salinity-induced impacts on transpiration. The use of salinity as an input feature improved the performance of all machine learning models. Salinity contributed up to 32% to the predictive capability of the machine learning models by improving the R-2, root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) of the machine learning models up to 19, 25, and 25%, respectively. Overall, the extreme gradient boosting model outperformed all the machine learning models. Furthermore, deployment of machine learning algorithms to a new data set effectively indicated a critical level of EC_IR of 6 dS m(- 1) on whole-plant transpiration above which transpiration significantly drops. Apart from transpiration the effect of salinity on biomass, the concentration of Na+ and Cl- contents in leaves and roots were evident. Overall, machine learning models can be useful tools for capturing salinity-induced impact on plant water use and its integration with crop stress management practices could be valuable.

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
LA English
DT Article
AB The coherent WaveBurst (cWB) search algorithm identifies generic gravitational wave (GW) signals in the LIGO-Virgo strain data. We propose a machine learning (ML) method to optimize the pipeline sensitivity to the special class of GW signals known as binary black hole (BBH) mergers. Here, we test the ML-enhanced cWB search on strain data from the first and second observing runs of Advanced LIGO and successfully recover all BBH events previously reported by cWB, with higher significance. For simulated events found with a false alarm rate less than 1 yr(-1), we demonstrate the improvement in the detection efficiency of 26% for stellar-mass BBH mergers and 16% for intermediate mass black hole binary mergers. To demonstrate the robustness of the ML-enhanced search for the detection of generic BBH signals, we show that it has the increased sensitivity to the spin precessing or eccentric BBH events, even when trained on simulated quasicircular BBH events with aligned spins.

TI A physics-informed deep learning model of the hot tail runaway electron
   seed
SO PHYSICS OF PLASMAS
LA English
DT Article
AB A challenging aspect of the description of a tokamak disruption is evaluating the hot tail runaway electron seed that emerges during the thermal quench. This problem is made challenging due to the requirement of describing a strongly non-thermal electron distribution, together with the need to incorporate a diverse range of multiphysics processes, including magnetohydrodynamic instabilities, impurity transport, and radiative losses. This work develops a physics-informed neural network (PINN) tailored to the solution of the hot tail seed during an axisymmetric thermal quench. Here, a PINN is developed to identify solutions to the adjoint relativistic Fokker-Planck equation in the presence of a rapid quench of the plasma's thermal energy. It is shown that the PINN is able to accurately predict the hot tail seed across a range of parameters, including the thermal quench timescale, initial plasma temperature, and local current density, in the absence of experimental or simulation data. The hot tail PINN is verified by comparison with direct Monte Carlo simulations, with excellent agreement found across a broad range of thermal quench conditions.

AB Real-world malware analysis consists of a complex pipeline of classifiers and data analysis-from detection to classification of capabilities to retrieval of unique training samples from user systems. In this article, we aim to reduce the complexity of these pipelines through the use of low-dimensional metric embeddings of Windows PE files, which can be used in a variety of downstream applications, including malware detection, family classification, and malware attribute tagging. Specifically, we enrich labeling of malicious and benign PE files with computationally-expensive, disassembly-based malicious capabilities information. Using this enhanced labeling, we derive several different types of efficient metric embeddings utilizing an embedding neural network trained via contrastive loss, Spearman rank correlation, and combinations thereof. Our evaluation examines performance on a variety of transfer tasks performed on the EMBER and SOREL datasets, demonstrating that low-dimensional, computationally-efficient metric embeddings maintain performance with little decay. This offers the potential to quickly retrain for a variety of transfer tasks at significantly reduced overhead and complexity. We conclude with an examination of practical considerations for the use of our proposed embedding approach, such as robustness to adversarial evasion and introduction of task-specific auxiliary objectives to improve performance on mission critical tasks.

AB Objective This study aimed to develop a natural language processing algorithm (NLP) using machine learning (ML) techniques to identify and classify documentation of preoperative cannabis use status. Materials and Methods We developed and applied a keyword search strategy to identify documentation of preoperative cannabis use status in clinical documentation within 60 days of surgery. We manually reviewed matching notes to classify each documentation into 8 different categories based on context, time, and certainty of cannabis use documentation. We applied 2 conventional ML and 3 deep learning models against manual annotation. We externally validated our model using the MIMIC-III dataset. Results The tested classifiers achieved classification results close to human performance with up to 93% and 94% precision and 95% recall of preoperative cannabis use status documentation. External validation showed consistent results with up to 94% precision and recall. Discussion Our NLP model successfully replicated human annotation of preoperative cannabis use documentation, providing a baseline framework for identifying and classifying documentation of cannabis use. We add to NLP methods applied in healthcare for clinical concept extraction and classification, mainly concerning social determinants of health and substance use. Our systematically developed lexicon provides a comprehensive knowledge-based resource covering a wide range of cannabis-related concepts for future NLP applications. Conclusion We demonstrated that documentation of preoperative cannabis use status could be accurately identified using an NLP algorithm. This approach can be employed to identify comparison groups based on cannabis exposure for growing research efforts aiming to guide cannabis-related clinical practices and policies.

AB Some individuals with intellectual disabilities do not respond to praise as a reinforcer, which may limit their ability to learn. We evaluated 2 procedures (stimulus pairing and response stimulus pairing), both of which involved pairing previously neutral praise statements with preferred edible items, to determine their usefulness in establishing praise as a reinforcer. Results of Study 1 indicated that stimulus pairing was not effective in conditioning praise as a reinforcer for 3 of 4 subjects; results were inconclusive for the 4th subject. Results of Study 2 indicated that response stimulus pairing was effective in conditioning praise as a reinforcer for 4 of 8 subjects. After conditioning, praise also increased the occurrence of additional target responses for these 4 subjects.

TI Empowering Scenario Planning with Artificial Intelligence: A Perspective

AB Scenario planning is a powerful tool for cities to navigate uncertainties and mitigate the impacts of adverse scenarios by projecting future outcomes based on present-day decisions. This approach is becoming increasingly important given the growing call for building resilient cities to face adverse future scenarios posed by emerging disruptive technologies and climate change. However, conventional scenario planning practices predominantly rely on expert knowledge and judgment, which may be limited in accounting for the complexity of future scenarios. Therefore, we explored the potential integration of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to assist scenario planning practices. We synthesized related studies from various disciplines (e.g., engineering, computer science, and urban planning) to identify the potential applications of AI in the three key components of scenario planning: plan generation, scenario generation, and plan evaluation. We then discuss the challenges and possible solutions for integrating AI into the scenario planning process and highlight the critical role of planning experts in this process. We conclude by outlining future research opportunities in this context. Ultimately, this study contributes to the advancement of scenario planning practices and aids the creation of more resilient cities that can thrive in an uncertain future. (c) 2024 THE AUTHORS.

AB Field-based course work has been foundational to Ecology and Evolutionary Biology curricula. However, opportunities for these experiences gradually have decreased over the past few decades and are being replaced with technology in the college learning environment. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic facilitated a rapid transition of all field-based courses to online only delivery, which we argue has forced us to reconsider how to deliver course content to retain field experiences in a manner that is safe during the pandemic but robust to ever changing constraints in the college classroom. Here, we propose pairing an intensive laboratory experience with an otherwise online delivery. We discuss several advantages of intensive laboratory experiences that occur in the field over a short but intensive time period over that of the traditional low-intensity weekly laboratory structure. In particular, intensive laboratory experiences are safer during the pandemic because they allow the group to be tested and isolated, allow more flexibility for students with competing interests for their time, and also enhance student interpersonal skills while still providing strong reinforcement of the skills typically honed through experiential learning. We present case studies for how we intend to apply our proposed model to two courses that heavily rely on field-based experiential learning to facilitate adoption.

AB Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their potential applications in diverse fields, ranging from the medical sector (people with motor and/or communication disabilities), cognitive training, gaming, and Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality (AR/VR), among other areas. BCI which can decode and recognize neural signals involved in speech and handwriting has the potential to greatly assist individuals with severe motor impairments in their communication and interaction needs. Innovative and cutting-edge advancements in this field have the potential to develop a highly accessible and interactive communication platform for these people. The purpose of this review paper is to analyze the existing research on handwriting and speech recognition from neural signals. So that the new researchers who are interested in this field can gain thorough knowledge in this research area. The current research on neural signal-based recognition of handwriting and speech has been categorized into two main types: invasive and non-invasive studies. We have examined the latest papers on converting speech-activity-based neural signals and handwriting-activity-based neural signals into text data. The methods of extracting data from the brain have also been discussed in this review. Additionally, this review includes a brief summary of the datasets, preprocessing techniques, and methods used in these studies, which were published between 2014 and 2022. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the methodologies used in the current literature on neural signal-based recognition of handwriting and speech. In essence, this article is intended to serve as a valuable resource for future researchers who wish to investigate neural signal-based machine-learning methods in their work.

AB Polygenic risk score (PRS) is a widely used approach for predicting individuals' genetic risk of complex diseases, playing a pivotal role in advancing precision medicine. Traditional PRS methods, predominantly following a linear structure, often fall short in capturing the intricate relationships between genotype and phenotype. In this study, we present PRS-Net, an interpretable geometric deep learning-based framework that effectively models the nonlinearity of biological systems for enhanced disease prediction and biological discovery. PRS-Net begins by deconvoluting the genome-wide PRS at the single-gene resolution and then explicitly encapsulates gene-gene interactions leveraging a graph neural network (GNN) for genetic risk prediction, enabling a systematic characterization of molecular interplay underpinning diseases. An attentive readout module is introduced to facilitate model interpretation. Extensive tests across multiple complex traits and diseases demonstrate the superior prediction performance of PRS-Net compared with a wide range of conventional PRS methods. The interpretability of PRS-Net further enhances the identification of disease-relevant genes and gene programs. PRS-Net provides a potent tool for concurrent genetic risk prediction and biological discovery for complex diseases.

AB Psychiatry is rapidly adopting digital phenotyping and artificial intelligence/machine learning tools to study mental illness based on tracking participants' locations, online activity, phone and text message usage, heart rate, sleep, physical activity, and more. Existing ethical frameworks for return of individual research results (IRRs) are inadequate to guide researchers for when, if, and how to return this unprecedented number of potentially sensitive results about each participant's real-world behavior. To address this gap, we convened an interdisciplinary expert working group, supported by a National Institute of Mental Health grant. Building on established guidelines and the emerging norm of returning results in participant-centered research, we present a novel framework specific to the ethical, legal, and social implications of returning IRRs in digital phenotyping research. Our framework offers researchers, clinicians, and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) urgently needed guidance, and the principles developed here in the context of psychiatry will be readily adaptable to other therapeutic areas.

AB Microbial biofilms are prevalent in various environments and pose significant challenges to food safety and public health. The biofilms formed by pathogens can cause food spoilage, foodborne illness, and infectious diseases, which are difficult to treat due to their enhanced antimicrobial resistance. While the composition and development of biofilms have been widely studied, their profound impact on food, the food industry, and public health has not been sufficiently recapitulated. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of microbial biofilms in the food industry and their implication on public health. It highlights the existence of biofilms along the food-producing chains and the underlying mechanisms of biofilm-associated diseases. Furthermore, this review thoroughly summarizes the enhanced understanding of microbial biofilms achieved through machine learning approaches in biofilm research. By consolidating existing knowledge, this review intends to facilitate developing effective strategies to combat biofilm-associated infections in both the food industry and public health.

ID OLDER-ADULTS; SOCIETY
AB Frailty is associated with poor post-operative outcomes. However, frailty assessments in clinical practice are challenging due to the need for more resources and pragmatic complexities. We aimed to create a pre-operative frailty ascertainment using machine learning (ML) from electronic health record (EHR) data that is built on the Fried frailty phenotype. We leveraged a research database of 8,999 individuals aged 65 years and above who underwent a surgery. Healthcare providers administered a pre-operative frailty assessment using the Fried frailty phenotype. We built ML models to predict pre-operative frailty as a whole and by surgical service. We used the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to interpret the results. Comparisons with the accumulated deficit approach were made using Pearson's correlation coefficients and McNemar's test. The ML model achieved an AUC of 0.74 in predicting pre-operative frailty phenotype. The ML models' predictive power varied by surgical services, with AUC ranging from 0.63 to 0.81. SHAP showed that advanced age, anemia, chronic pulmonary disease, and literacy deficit were the most important features of pre-operative frailty. The ML model had similar performance to the accumulated deficit approach, with positive correlation (r: 0.36-0.58, P> 0.001) between frailty risk scores predicted by ML and frailty indices obtained from the accumulated deficit approach. Our approach provided new insights into the importance of specific EHR features in pre-operative frailty assessment. ML may offer an alternative method to predict frailty in pre-operative settings. Further validation on external data sources is required to generalize our ML models.

AB We introduce the DaRk mattEr and Astrophysics with Machine learning and Simulations (DREAMS) project, an innovative approach to understanding the astrophysical implications of alternative dark matter (DM) models and their effects on galaxy formation and evolution. The DREAMS project will ultimately comprise thousands of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that simultaneously vary over DM physics, astrophysics, and cosmology in modeling a range of systems-from galaxy clusters to ultra-faint satellites. Such extensive simulation suites can provide adequate training sets for machine-learning-based analyses. This paper introduces two new cosmological hydrodynamical suites of warm dark matter (WDM), each comprising 1024 simulations generated using the arepo code. One suite consists of uniform-box simulations covering a (25h-1Mpc)3 volume, while the other consists of Milky Way zoom-ins with sufficient resolution to capture the properties of classical satellites. For each simulation, the WDM particle mass is varied along with the initial density field and several parameters controlling the strength of baryonic feedback within the IllustrisTNG model. We provide two examples, separately utilizing emulators and convolutional neural networks, to demonstrate how such simulation suites can be used to disentangle the effects of DM and baryonic physics on galactic properties. The DREAMS project can be extended further to include different DM models, galaxy formation physics, and astrophysical targets. In this way, it will provide an unparalleled opportunity to characterize uncertainties on predictions for small-scale observables, leading to robust predictions for testing the particle physics nature of DM on these scales.

AB The development of coordinated reach-to-grasp movement has been well studied in infants and children. However, the role of motor cortex during this development is unclear because it is difficult to study in humans. We took the approach of using a brain-machine interface (BMI) paradigm in rhesus macaques with prior therapeutic amputations to examine the emergence of novel, coordinated reach to grasp. Previous research has shown that after amputation, the cortical area previously involved in the control of the lost limb undergoes reorganization, but prior BMI work has largely relied on finding neurons that already encode specific movement-related information. In this study, we taught macaques to cortically control a robotic arm and hand through operant conditioning, using neurons that were not explicitly reach or grasp related. Over the course of training, stereotypical patterns emerged and stabilized in the cross-covariance between the reaching and grasping velocity profiles, between pairs of neurons involved in controlling reach and grasp, and to a comparable, but lesser, extent between other stable neurons in the network. In fact, we found evidence of this structured coordination between pairs composed of all combinations of neurons decoding reach or grasp and other stable neurons in the network. The degree of and participation in coordination was highly correlated across all pair types. Our approach provides a unique model for studying the development of novel, coordinated reach-to-grasp movement at the behavioral and cortical levels.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY Given that motor cortex undergoes reorganization after amputation, our work focuses on training nonhuman primates with chronic amputations to use neurons that are not reach or grasp related to control a robotic arm to reach to grasp through the use of operant conditioning, mimicking early development. We studied the development of a novel, coordinated behavior at the behavioral and cortical level, and the neural plasticity in M1 associated with learning to use a brain-machine interface.

ID ANESTHESIA
AB Simulators and training devices are used extensively by educators in 'high-tech' occupations, especially those requiring an understanding of complex systems and co-ordinated psychomotor skills. Because of advances in computer technology, anaesthetised patients can now be realistically simulated. This paper describes several training devices and a simulator currently being employed in the training of anaesthesia personnel at the University of Florida. This Gainesville Anesthesia Simulator (GAS) comprises a patient mannequin, anaesthesia gas machine, and a full set of normally operating monitoring instruments. The patient can spontaneously breathe, has audible heart and breath sounds, and palpable pulses. The mannequin contains a sophisticated lung model that consumes and eliminates gas according to physiological principles. Interconnected computers controlling the physical signs of the mannequin enable the presentation of a multitude of clinical signs. In addition, the anaesthesia machine, which is functionally intact, has hidden fault activators to challenge the user to correct equipment malfunctions. Concealed sensors monitor the users' actions and responses. A robust data acquisition and control system and a user-friendly scripting language for programming simulation scenarios are key features of GAS and make this system applicable for the training of both the beginning resident and the experienced practitioner. GAS enhances clinical education in anaesthesia by providing a non-threatening environment that fosters learning by doing. Exercises with the simulator are supported by sessions on a number of training devices. These present theoretical and practical interactive courses on the anaesthesia machine and on monitors. An extensive system, for example, introduces the student to the physics and clinical application of transoesophageal echocardiography. At the University of Florida the simulator system is in use for the eduction of anaesthesia residents. Tests have shown that the system accelerates learning.

AB Pathological behaviors such as problem gambling or shopping are characterized by compulsive choice despite alternative options and negative costs. Reinforcement learning algorithms allow a computation of prediction error, a comparison of actual and expected outcomes, which updates our predictions and influences our subsequent choices. Using a reinforcement learning model, we show data consistent with the idea that dopamine agonists in susceptible individuals with Parkinson's disease increase the rate of learning from gain outcomes. Dopamine agonists also increase striatal prediction error activity, thus signifying a "better than expected" outcome. Thus, our findings are consistent with a model whereby a distorted estimation of the gain cue underpins a choice bias toward gains.

AB Background: Postoperative acute kidney injury is common after major vascular surgery and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and cost. High-performance risk stratification using a machine learning model can inform strategies that mitigate harm and optimize resource use. It is hypothesized that incorporating intraoperative data would improve machine learning model accuracy, discrimination, and precision in predicting acute kidney injury among patients undergoing major vascular surgery. Methods: A single-center retrospective cohort of 1,531 adult patients who underwent nonemergency major vascular surgery, including open aortic, endovascular aortic, and lower extremity bypass pro-cedures, was evaluated. The validated, automated MySurgeryRisk analytics platform used electronic health record data to forecast patient-level probabilistic risk scores for postoperative acute kidney injury using random forest models with preoperative data alone and perioperative data (preoperative plus intraoperative). The MySurgeryRisk predictions were compared with each other as well as with the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification. Results: Machine learning models using perioperative data had greater accuracy, discrimination, and precision than models using either preoperative data alone or the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification (accuracy: 0.70 vs 0.64 vs 0.62, area under the receiver operating charac-teristics curve: 0.77 vs 0.68 vs 0.61, area under the precision-recall curve: 0.70 vs 0.58 vs 0.48). Conclusion: In predicting acute kidney injury after major vascular surgery, machine learning approaches that incorporate dynamic intraoperative data had greater accuracy, discrimination, and precision than models using either preoperative data alone or the American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification. Machine learning methods have the potential for real-time identification of high-risk patients who may benefit from personalized risk-reduction strategies. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Simple Summary
   A variety of different acoustic devices has been commercialized for detection of hidden insect infestations in stored products, trees, and soil, including a recently introduced device demonstrated in this report to successfully detect rice weevil immatures and adults in grain. Several of the systems have incorporated digital signal processing and statistical analyses such as neural networks and machine learning to distinguish targeted pests from each other and from background noise, enabling automated monitoring of the abundance and distribution of pest insects in stored products, and potentially reducing the need for chemical control. Current and previously available devices are reviewed in the context of the extensive research in stored product insect acoustic detection since 2011. It is expected that further development of acoustic technology for detection and management of stored product insect pests will continue, facilitating automation and decreasing detection and management costs.
   Acoustic technology provides information difficult to obtain about stored insect behavior, physiology, abundance, and distribution. For example, acoustic detection of immature insects feeding hidden within grain is helpful for accurate monitoring because they can be more abundant than adults and be present in samples without adults. Modern engineering and acoustics have been incorporated into decision support systems for stored product insect management, but with somewhat limited use due to device costs and the skills needed to interpret the data collected. However, inexpensive modern tools may facilitate further incorporation of acoustic technology into the mainstream of pest management and precision agriculture. One such system was tested herein to describe Sitophilus oryzae (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) adult and larval movement and feeding in stored grain. Development of improved methods to identify sounds of targeted pest insects, distinguishing them from each other and from background noise, is an active area of current research. The most powerful of the new methods may be machine learning. The methods have different strengths and weaknesses depending on the types of background noise and the signal characteristic of target insect sounds. It is likely that they will facilitate automation of detection and decrease costs of managing stored product insects in the future.

AB Plant parasitic nematodes are significant contributors to yield loss worldwide, causing devastating losses to every crop species, in every climate. Mitigating these losses requires swift and informed management strategies, centered on identification and quantification of field populations. Current plant parasitic nematode identification methods rely heavily on manual analyses of microscope images by a highly trained nematologist. This mode is not only expensive and time consuming, but often excludes the possibility of widely sharing and disseminating results to inform regional trends and potential emergent issues. This work presents a new public dataset containing annotated images of plant parasitic nematodes from heterologous soil extractions. This dataset serves to propagate new automated methodologies or speedier plant parasitic nematode identification using multiple deep learning object detection models and offers a path towards widely shared tools, results, and meta-analyses.

AB Our understanding of the spatial distribution of soil carbon (C) pools across diverse land uses, soils, and climatic gradients at regional scale is still limited. Research in digital soil mapping and modeling that investigates the interplay between (i) soil C pools and environmental factors ("deterministic trend model") and (ii) stochastic, spatially dependent variations in soil C fractions ("stochastic model") is just emerging. This evoked our motivation to investigate soil C pools in the State of Florida covering about 150,000 km(2). Our specific objectives were to (i) compare different soil C pool models that quantify stochastic and/or deterministic components, (ii) assess the prediction performance of soil C models, and (iii) identify environmental factors that impart most control on labile and recalcitrant pools and soil total C (TC). We used soil data (0-20 cm) from a research collected at 1014 georeferenced sites including measured bulk density, recalcitrant carbon (RC), labile (hot-water extractable) carbon (HC) and TC. A comprehensive set of 327 geospatial soil-environmental variables was acquired. The Boruta method was employed to identify "all-relevant" soil-environmental predictors. We employed eight methods - Classification and Regression Tree (CaRT), Bagged Regression Tree (BaRT), Boosted Regression Tree (BoRT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR), Regression Kriging (RK), and Ordinary Kriging (OK) - to predict soil C fractions and TC. Overall, 36, 20 and 25 predictors stood out as "all-relevant" to estimate TC, RC and HC, respectively. We predicted a mean of 5.29 +/- 3.58 kg TC m(-2) in the top 20 cm with the best model. The prediction performance assessed by the Ratio of Prediction Error to Inter-quartile Range for TC stocks was as follows: RF > SVM > BoRT > BaRT > PLSR > RK > CART > OK. The best models explained 71.6%, 71.7% and 30.5% of the total variation for TC, RC and HC, respectively. Biotic and hydro-pedological factors explained most of the variation in soil C pools and TC; lithologic and climatic factors showed some relationships to soil C pools and TC, whereas topographic factors faded from soil C models.

AB Automated individual tree crown (ITC) delineation plays an important role in forest remote sensing. Accurate ITC delineation benefits biomass estimation, allometry estimation, and species classification among other forest-related tasks, all of which are used to monitor forest health and make important decisions in forest management. In this article, we introduce neuro-symbolic DeepForest, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based ITC delineation algorithm that uses a neuro-symbolic framework to inject domain knowledge (represented as rules written in probabilistic soft logic) into a CNN. We create rules that encode concepts for competition, allometry, constrained growth, mean ITC area, and crown color. Our results show that the delineation model learns from the annotated training data as well as the rules and that under some conditions, the injection of rules improves model performance and affects model bias. We then analyze the effects of each rule on its related aspects of model performance. We find that the addition of domain data can improve F1 by as much as four F1 points, reduce the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) between ground-truth and predicted area distributions, and reduce the aggregate error in area between ground-truth and predicted delineations.

AB Micro-grid protection presents great technical challenges to utility company engineers. Several protection schemes have been developed towards a reliable operation on these type of networks, however, the methods are strongly dependent on robust communication systems. This paper presents a decentralized adaptive protection scheme and introduces a data-driven and communication-less approach. The presented solution uses an Artificial Neural Network to train Intelligent Electronic Devices as fault classifiers, also, it uses a cuckoo search metaheuristic to its quasi-optimal adjustment. The Artificial Neural Network enables each classifier to detect faults with only local voltage and current measurements. Presented solution does not assume communication between devices, however, each device brings support to their neighboring devices as back-up protection. Further, system dynamics on the electrical network, such as, changes of topologies, micro-grid status or Distributed Energy Resources outage are considered. The time coordination is simple and easily adjustable due to each fault label of the data-driven model has its own time operation. The presented method is validated on the modified IEEE 34nodes test feeder. The results of the adaptive protection scheme show accuracy values above of 96% and dependability of 99%. Also, the solution reveals a correlation between the location and the combination of features and hyper-parameters for each Intelligent Electronic Device. The method is development to be easy-toimplement, without hard-to-design parameters, and with highlights potential aspects for real-life applications.

We give efficient algorithms for calculating persistence landscapes, their averages, and distances between such averages. We discuss an implementation of these algorithms and some related procedures.

AB Despite a substantial body of scholarship at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and journalism, it remains relatively unexplored as to how AI-generated news is different from news produced by professional journalists in terms of news bias. To fill the gap, this study compares human versus GPT-2-generated news in terms of the linguistic features, tone, and bias toward gender and race/ethnicity on two highly controversial issues, namely abortion and immigration, using news transcripts from CNN and Fox News. In doing so, the study adopts a mixed-method content analysis approach, including dictionary and coreference analysis, topic modeling and semantic network analysis, and manual content analysis. The results reveal that although AI news differs from human news in terms of language features and thematic areas, machine news is not necessarily more biased compared to human news regarding gender and race/ethnicity. Implications are discussed for future scholarship on algorithmic bias in lieu of the roles that AI-generated news may play in journalism and democracy.

AB Background: Foodborne pathogens present a significant challenge to food safety. Traditional culture-based methods are often time-consuming and labor-intensive, while newer technologies have limitations, such as requiring specialized expertise or costly equipment. This has driven the development of sensor arrays, like electronic noses (e-noses) and optical sensor arrays, which use multiple cross-reactive sensor elements to generate unique fingerprints for various analytes. Scope and approach: This review highlights recent advances in the design of sensor arrays and the materials commonly used as their building blocks. We outline four key principles for constructing sensor arrays: detecting volatile organic compounds (VOCs), antibody-based sensors, bacterial surface physiology and microenvironments, and metabolic activity. We also discuss the use of machine learning (ML) in sensor array interpretation and output. Additionally, we explore the challenges in multiplexed pathogen detection and emerging trends in the field. Key findings and conclusions: Bacterial cell envelope microenvironments and metabolic activities have received the most attention in the development of sensor arrays. ML models play a critical role not only in pattern recognition but also in tasks like data preprocessing, such as correcting signal drift in e-noses and handling outliers. Challenges like small datasets are addressed through potential solutions such as few-shot learning and leave-one-out cross-validation. Sensor arrays show great promise for in-field pathogen identification, offering valuable benefits to food producers and processors alike.

AB Analyzing the geometric properties of high-dimensional loss functions, such as local curvature and the existence of other optima around a certain point in loss space, can help provide a better understanding of the interplay between neural-network structure, implementation attributes, and learning performance. In this paper, we combine concepts from high-dimensional probability and differential geometry to study how curvature properties in lower-dimensional loss representations depend on those in the original loss space. We show that saddle points in the original space are rarely correctly identified as such in the expected lower-dimensional representations if random projections are used. The principal curvature in the expected lower-dimensional representation is proportional to the mean curvature in the original loss space. Hence, the mean curvature in the original loss space determines if saddle points appear, on average, as either minima, maxima, or almost flat regions. We use the connection between expected curvature in random projections and mean curvature in the original space (i.e. the normalized Hessian trace) to compute Hutchinson-type trace estimates without calculating Hessian-vector products as in the original Hutchinson method. Because random projections are not suitable for correctly identifying saddle information, we propose to study projections along the dominant Hessian directions that are associated with the largest and smallest principal curvatures. We connect our findings to the ongoing debate on loss landscape flatness and generalizability. Finally, for different common image classifiers and a function approximator, we show and compare random and Hessian projections of loss landscapes with up to approximately 7x106 parameters.

ID PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION
AB Due to the increasingly complex interaction between the tightly integrated components, reuse of various untrustworthy third-party IPs (3PIPs), and security-unaware design practices, there have been a rising number of reports of system-on-chip (SoC) hardware (HW) vulnerabilities that compromise the security of critical assets. SoC security verification, therefore, is an indispensable part of the verification effort. The existing hardware verification methodologies either presuppose white-box knowledge or scale poorly with increasing design complexity. Hardware penetration testing (pentest) is an emerging gray-box security verification methodology at the register-transfer level (RTL) that is applicable across a wide variety of threat models and addresses many shortcomings of the existing methodologies. In this work, we propose Re-Pen, a novel hardware pentest framework that requires minimal gray-box information from the design specification to achieve significantly better security vulnerability (SV) detection performance than state-of-the-art pentest techniques. At the core of this framework lies a mutation engine that combines the strengths of reinforcement learning (RL) and binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) in its test pattern mutation strategy to generate intelligent test patterns without manual supervision. This framework significantly reduces the requirement for detailed, manual, expertise-driven adaptations specific to the SoC under test. Through extensive experiments conducted on multiple SoCs, we demonstrate that Re-Pen can reduce vulnerability detection time by up to 3 $\times$ and achieve a markedly improved consistency compared with the state of the art. Furthermore, Re-Pen was able to detect native security bugs in an open-source SoC. It successfully identified a scenario where, despite a functionally correct hardware implementation, a mistake in the architectural specification allowed privilege escalation from the software layer.

ID PARADOX; TRANSPARENCY
AB PurposeDrawing on the personalization-privacy paradox and guided by means-end analysis, this study explores how consumers balance their concerns for privacy and the benefits of smart home device personalization and the role that trust plays in the process. More specifically, this study aims to investigate how perceptions of smart device personalization and privacy concerns are shaped by consumers' experiences and the role of trust in the deliberation process.Design/methodology/approachIn-depth interviews were conducted across diverse demographic groups of smart device users to shed light on the balancing act between personalization and privacy.FindingsThe study found that product experience, ownership type, perceived value of convenience and control and quality of life via "smart things" are key motivators for product usage. The benefits of tailored recommendations and high relevance are balanced against the risks of echo chamber effects and loss of control. The results also show the role of active involvement in the privacy calculus and trust level. The study points to the significance of an ecosystem-based service/business model in gaining consumer confidence when they balance between personalization and privacy.Originality/valueAlthough many studies have explored trust, privacy concerns and personalization in an artificial intelligence (AI)-related context, few have addressed trust in the context of both smart devices and the personalization-privacy paradox. As such, this study adds to the existing literature by incorporating the concept of trust and addressing both privacy concerns and personalization in the AI context.

AB This study examines the obstacles to the effectiveness of fact-checking, focusing primarily on the pervasive impact of entrenched biases. Fact-checking efforts often face resistance when linked to mistrusted sources, leading to cognitive dissonance and the rejection of messages in favor of pre-existing beliefs, a phenomenon known as motivated reasoning. This resistance hinders organizations' ability to correct misconceptions surrounding social issues and entities. The research delves into whether non-human entities such as AI can facilitate less biased information processing due to their perceived impartiality. Applying a moderated mediation model in experimental settings, we found that labeling a source as artificial intelligence is pivotal in evaluating factchecking. AI labels moderate the impact of partisan biases on the persuasive outcomes of fact-checks, such as message credibility and acceptance, compared to the human source. This study offers valuable insights for enhancing the effectiveness of fact-checking in the context of cognitive and psychological biases by highlighting the critical influence of information sources in reducing polarization in public perceptions of scientific issues.

AB We evaluate a program in Guatemala offering training and transfers of a local chicken variety using a randomized phase-in design with imperfect compliance. We do not find strong evidence for or against positive average intent-to-treat effects on household-level outcomes, including indicators of expenditure, calorie and protein intake, diet quality, egg consumption and production, as well as chicken ownership and management. Among girls between the ages of six and sixty months, we find that the program reduced stunting by 23.5 (+/- 19.4) percentage points while also improving other height and weight outcomes. Boys are more likely to suffer from intestinal illness, which could explain differences in program impacts by gender. Using machine learning methods, we show that the poorest households enjoyed the largest impacts on diet quality and animal protein consumption, whereas children in the poorest households experienced the largest impacts on the probability of consuming animal source foods. Larger effects on animal source food consumption among children in relatively poor households did not translate into greater impacts on height or weight.

AB Understanding the subcellular localization of long non-coding RNAs (IncRNAs) is crucial for unraveling their functional mechanisms. While previous computational methods have made progress in predicting IncRNA subcellular localization, most of them ignore the sequence order information by relying on k-mer frequency features to encode IncRNA sequences. In the study, we develope SGCL-LncLoc, a novel interpretable deep learning model based on supervised graph contrastive learning. SGCL-LncLoc transforms IncRNA sequences into de Bruijn graphs and uses the Word2Vec technique to learn the node representation of the graph. Then, SGCL-LncLoc applies graph convolutional networks to learn the comprehensive graph representation. Additionally, we propose a computational method to map the attention weights of the graph nodes to the weights of nucleotides in the IncRNA sequence, allowing SGCL-LncLoc to serve as an interpretable deep learning model. Furthermore, SGCL-LncLoc employs a supervised contrastive learning strategy, which leverages the relationships between different samples and label information, guiding the model to enhance representation learning for IncRNAs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SGCL-LncLoc outperforms both deep learning baseline models and existing predictors, showing its capability for accurate IncRNA subcellular localization prediction. Furthermore, we conduct a motif analysis, revealing that SGCL-LncLoc successfully captures known motifs associated with IncRNA subcellular localization. The SGCL-LncLoc web server is available at http://csuligroup.com:8000/SGCL-LncLoc. The source code can be obtained from https://github.com/CSUBioGroup/SGCL-LncLoc.

AB In the context of hardware trust and assurance, reverse engineering has been often considered as an illegal action. Generally speaking, reverse engineering aims to retrieve information from a product, i.e., integrated circuits (ICs) and printed circuit boards (PCBs) in hardware security-related scenarios, in the hope of understanding the functionality of the device and determining its constituent components. Hence, it can raise serious issues concerning Intellectual Property (IP) infringement, the (in)effectiveness of security-related measures, and even new opportunities for injecting hardware Trojans. Ironically, reverse engineering can enable IP owners to verify and validate the design. Nevertheless, this cannot be achieved without overcoming numerous obstacles that limit successful outcomes of the reverse engineering process. This article surveys these challenges from two complementary perspectives: image processing and machine learning. These two fields of study form a firm basis for the enhancement of efficiency and accuracy of reverse engineering processes for both PCBs and ICs. In summary, therefore, this article presents a roadmap indicating clearly the actions to be taken to fulfill hardware trust and assurance objectives.

AB Botrytis fruit rot and anthracnose are fungal diseases of strawberry. These diseases are a significant contributor to yield losses, requiring farmers to use fungicides frequently to prevent them. The proliferation of botrytis and anthracnose is directly linked to the duration of the presence of free water on the plant canopy, which is generally defined as leaf wetness duration (LWD). LWD is an important measure in determining the risk for these diseases to develop in the strawberry crop. By accurately measuring LWD, the risk of disease can be calculated more accurately, and specific fungicide application recommendations can be given to the farmers. This reduces the frequency with which fungicide is applied and ultimately reduces costs for farmers. There is no standard method to detect leaf wetness, but leaf wetness sensors are widely used for that purpose. These wetness sensors are difficult to calibrate and not very accurate, which reduces their reliability. The objective of this study was to find a better alternative to the commonly used leaf wetness sensors. This study implemented color and thermal imaging-based approaches as a solution to the problem of leaf wetness detection in strawberry plants. The proposed method used deep learning and computer vision techniques to detect leaf wetness from color and thermal images. The deep learning model was highly accurate in detecting wetness when compared with the visual observation of the images. It was also found that leaf wetness could be detected with a high degree of accuracy using deep learning with color images. In the future, using the findings of this study, a portable device can be developed to replace the commonly used wetness sensor with a more reliable imaging-based device.

AB Synthesis from linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications provides assured controllers for systems operating in stochastic and potentially adversarial environments. Automatic synthesis tools, however, require a model of the environment to construct controllers. In this work, we introduce a model-free reinforcement learning (RL) approach to derive controllers from given LTL specifications even when the environment is completely unknown. We model the problem as a stochastic game (SG) between the controller and the environment; we then learn optimal strategies that maximize the probability of satisfying the LTL specifications against the worst-case environment behavior. We first construct a product game using the deterministic parity automaton (DPA) translated from the given LTL specification. By deriving distinct rewards and discount factors from the acceptance condition of the DPA, we reduce the maximization of the worst-case probability of satisfying the LTL specification into the maximization of a discounted reward objective in the product game; this enables the use of model-free RL algorithms to learn an optimal controller strategy. To address the scalability issues arising when the number of sets defining the acceptance condition of the DPA, usually referred to as colors, is large; we propose a lazy color generation method where distinct rewards and discount factors are utilized only when needed, and an approximate method where the controller eventually focuses on only one color. In several case studies, we show that our approach is scalable to a wide range of LTL formulas, significantly outperforming existing methods that learn controllers from LTL specifications in SGs.

AB A sea change is happening in finance. Machines appear to be on the rise and humans on the decline. Human endeavors have become unmanned endeavors. Human thought and human deliberation have been replaced by computerized analysis and mathematical models. Technological advances have made finance faster, larger, more global, more interconnected, and less human. Modern finance is becoming an industry in which the main players are no longer entirely human. Instead, the key players are now cyborgs: part machine, part human. Modem finance is transforming into what this Article calls cyborg finance.
   This Article offers one of the first broad, descriptive, and normative examinations of this sea change and its wide-ranging effects on law, society, and finance. The Article begins by placing the rise of artificial intelligence and computerization in finance within a larger social context. Next, it explores the evolution and birth of a new investor paradigm in law precipitated by that rise. This Article then identifies and addresses regulatory dangers, challenges, and consequences tied to the increasing reliance on artificial intelligence and computers. Specifically, it warns of emerging financial threats in cyberspace, examines new systemic risks linked to speed and connectivity, studies law's capacity to govern this evolving financial landscape, and explores the growing resource asymmetries in finance. Finally, drawing on themes from the legal discourse about the choice between rules and standards, this Article closes with a defense of humans in an uncertain financial world in which machines continue to rise, and it asserts that smarter humans working with smart machines possess the key to better returns and better futures.

AB The current work introduces a system for fully automatic tracking of native glenohumeral kinematics in stereo-radiography sequences. The proposed method first applies convolutional neural networks to obtain segmentation and semantic key point predictions in biplanar radiograph frames. Preliminary bone pose estimates are computed by solving a non-convex optimization problem with semidefinite relaxations to register digitized bone landmarks to semantic key points. Initial poses are then refined by registering computed tomography-based digitally reconstructed radiographs to captured scenes, which are masked by segmentation maps to isolate the shoulder joint. A particular neural net architecture which exploits subject-specific geometry is also introduced to improve segmentation predictions and increase robustness of subsequent pose estimates. The method is evaluated by comparing predicted glenohumeral kinematics to manually tracked values from 17 trials capturing 4 dynamic activities. Median orientation differences between predicted and ground truth poses were 1.7 degrees and 8.6 degrees for the scapula and humerus, respectively. Joint-level kinematics differences were less than 2 degrees in 65%, 13%, and 63% of frames for XYZ orientation DoFs based on Euler angle decompositions. Automation of kinematic tracking can increase scalability of tracking workflows in research, clinical, or surgical applications.

AB Statistical learning theory provides a formal criterion for learning a concept from examples. This theory addresses directly the trade-off in empirical fit and generalization. In practice, this leads to the structural risk-minimization principle where one minimizes a bound on the overall risk functional. For learning linear discriminant functions, this bound is impacted by the minimum of two terms-the dimension and the inverse of the margin. A popular and powerful learning mechanism, support vector machines, focuses on maximizing the margin. We compare this to methods that focus on minimizing the dimensionality, which, coincidentally, fulfills another useful criterion-the minimum description length principle.

AB Accurate and timely regional estimates of agricultural production are key for decision makers. This study aims to understand how different machine learning techniques impact soybean yield estimation in extracting maximum information from remotely sensed MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI) that is constrained by phenology. Specifically, a methodology is developed for incorporating phenological information aligned with EVI acquisition for each pixel and selecting the most significant predictors out of 36 predictors using feature selection. These predictors were then used in four machine learning algorithms (MLA) to obtain soybean yield estimates for observed farms in the Parana State, Brazil. The optimal MLAwas then implemented for the whole state to obtain regional soybean yield. The gradient boosting model (GBM) with all 36 predictors performed well with a mean difference of 3.5 kg ha(-1), an RMSD of 373 kg ha(-1), and Willmott's d of 0.85, however, the random forest (RF) algorithm using five optimal EVI predictors presented similar results, but with considerably less computational time. Both GBM and RF provided higher regional yields compared to the officially reported yields by 1775 x 10(3) and 2059 x 10(3) metric tons, respectively. The RF with five EVI predictors provided the best results for regional soybean estimations, considering the accuracy and computational performances.

AB We present the Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations (CAMELS) project. CAMELS is a suite of 4233 cosmological simulations of (25 h(-1)Mpc)(3) volume each: 2184 state-of-the- art (magneto) hydrodynamic simulations run with the AREPO and GIZMO codes, employing the same baryonic subgrid physics as the IllustrisTNG and SIMBA simulations, and 2049 N-body simulations. The goal of the CAMELS project is to provide theory predictions for different observables as a function of cosmology and astrophysics, and it is the largest suite of cosmological (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations designed to train machine- learning algorithms. CAMELS contains thousands of different cosmological and astrophysical models by way of varying Omega(m), sigma(8), and four parameters controlling stellar and active galactic nucleus feedback, following the evolution of more than 100 billion particles and fluid elements over a combined volume of (400 h(-1)Mpc)(3). We describe the simulations in detail and characterize the large range of conditions represented in terms of the matter power spectrum, cosmic star formation rate density, galaxy stellar mass function, halo baryon fractions, and several galaxy scaling relations. We show that the IllustrisTNG and SIMBA suites produce roughly similar distributions of galaxy properties over the full parameter space but significantly different halo baryon fractions and baryonic effects on the matter power spectrum. This emphasizes the need for marginalizing over baryonic effects to extract the maximum amount of information from cosmological surveys. We illustrate the unique potential of CAMELS using several machine-learning applications, including nonlinear interpolation, parameter estimation, symbolic regression, data generation with Generative Adversarial Networks, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.

AB DBS Think Tank IX was held on August 25-27, 2021 in Orlando FL with US based participants largely in person and overseas participants joining by video conferencing technology. The DBS Think Tank was founded in 2012 and provides an open platform where clinicians, engineers and researchers (from industry and academia) can freely discuss current and emerging deep brain stimulation (DBS) technologies as well as the logistical and ethical issues facing the field. The consensus among the DBS Think Tank IX speakers was that DBS expanded in its scope and has been applied to multiple brain disorders in an effort to modulate neural circuitry. After collectively sharing our experiences, it was estimated that globally more than 230,000 DBS devices have been implanted for neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. As such, this year's meeting was focused on advances in the following areas: neuromodulation in Europe, Asia and Australia; cutting-edge technologies, neuroethics, interventional psychiatry, adaptive DBS, neuromodulation for pain, network neuromodulation for epilepsy and neuromodulation for traumatic brain injury.

TI Atomic Charge Schemes Comparison for Fe Single Atom in Graphitic Carbon:
   Insights from Quantum Simulations and Machine Learning
SO JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C

ID TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; POPULATION ANALYSIS; CATALYSTS; HIRSHFELD;
   GRAPHENE
AB Single-atom catalysts (SACs), where a transition-metal atom is embedded in graphitic carbon materials, have shown great potential as effective catalysts. The metal atom plays a major role in determining the catalytic reactivity, and substrate-metal interaction can tailor the intrinsic properties of metal, for example, the atomic partial charge. However, in quantum simulations, various charge schemes are used to assign charges for molecules and materials. It remains unclear whether the atomic partial charge of the metal in SACs is correlated across different charge schemes and if they exhibit different behaviors in response to variations in metal-substrate interactions. In this study, we investigated the behavior of Bader, Mulliken, Hirshfeld, Charge Model 5 (CM5), and Density Derived Electrostatic and Chemical 6 (DDEC6) charge schemes for Fe-centered SACs using quantum simulations and machine learning models. By tuning the structural and chemical parameters in the systems, we examined 166 Fe-centered graphene flakes and compared different charge schemes on the Fe atom. We observed that the DDEC6, Mulliken, and Hirshfeld charges exhibit more noticeable correlations than Bader and CM5 charges. Our findings also indicate that the local chemical environment plays a crucial role in determining the atomic charge of Fe in SACs and that different charge schemes present varied responses to changes in metal-substrate interactions. Additionally, we utilized machine learning (ML) models to predict all five charge schemes by gathering features from geometric, atomic, and electronic properties. Our machine learning models successfully predicted the CM5 scheme, which is primarily determined by electronic properties. However, for DDEC6, Bader, Mulliken, and Hirshfeld schemes, geometric features played a significant role, resulting in lower prediction accuracy than CM5. We expect that the insights gained from this study will contribute to a better understanding of the selection of appropriate charge schemes for SACs design.

AB Clinical and technological advances promoting early hemorrhage control and physiologic resuscitation as well as early diagnosis and optimal treatment of sepsis have significantly decreased in-hospital mortality for many critically ill patient populations. However, a substantial proportion of severe trauma and sepsis survivors will develop protracted organ dysfunction termed chronic critical illness (CCI), defined as >= 14 days requiring intensive care unit (ICU) resources with ongoing organ dysfunction. A subset of CCI patients will develop the persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome (PICS), and these individuals are predisposed to a poor quality of life and indolent death. We propose that CCI and PICS after trauma or sepsis are the result of an inappropriate bone marrow response characterized by the generation of dysfunctional myeloid populations at the expense of lympho- and erythropoiesis. This review describes similarities among CCI/PICS phenotypes in sepsis, cancer, and aging and reviews the role of aberrant myelopoiesis in the pathophysiology of CCI and PICS. In addition, we characterize pathogen recognition, the interface between innate and adaptive immune systems, and therapeutic approaches including immune modulators, gut microbiota support, and nutritional and exercise therapy. Finally, we discuss the future of diagnostic and prognostic approaches guided by machine and deep-learning models trained and validated on big data to identify patients for whom these approaches will yield the greatest benefits. A deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of CCI and PICS and continued investigation into novel therapies harbor the potential to improve the current dismal long-term outcomes for critically ill post-injury and post-infection patients.

AB Reckless driving severely threatens the safety of innocent people, which accounts for around 33% of all fatalities in major vehicle accidents. However, most existing efforts focus on the detection and adjustment of a vehicle's own driving behavior, whose effectiveness is very limited. In this paper, we develop a defensive alerting system to detect and notify the threats posed by reckless vehicles. By integrating the computation capability of a cloud server with that of vehicles nowadays, we propose a cooperative driving performance rating (CDPR) mechanism to automatically and intelligently detect reckless vehicles based on machine learning algorithms. To support such a defensive alerting system, a three-tier system architecture is developed from existing vehicular networks, which consists of vehicles, road-side units (RSU) and a cloud server. Moreover, given the fact that most vehicles can be trusted to drive safely, to further reduce the transmission load of the CDPR mechanism, we design our scheme in such a way that every vehicle only uploads the data of driving maneuvers with reckless potential to RSUs. Based on the aggregated data, the cloud server globally rates every vehicle's driving performance by using support vector machine (SVM) and decision-tree machine learning models. We finally implement the proposed CDPR mechanism into a popular traffic simulator, Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO), for evaluation. Simulation results illustrate that our defensive alerting system can accurately detect reckless vehicles and effectively provide timely alerts.

ID CONVERGENCE
AB The increasingly deeper neural networks hinder the democratization of privacy-enhancing distributed learning, such as federated learning (FL), to resource-constrained devices. To overcome this challenge, in this paper, we advocate the integration of edge computing paradigm and parallel split learning (PSL), allowing multiple edge devices to offload substantial training workloads to an edge server via layer-wise model split. By observing that existing PSL schemes incur excessive training latency and a large volume of data transmissions, we propose an innovative PSL framework, namely, efficient parallel split learning (EPSL), to accelerate model training. To be specific, EPSL parallelizes client-side model training and reduces the dimension of activations' gradients for backpropagation (BP) via last-layer gradient aggregation, leading to a significant reduction in server-side training and communication latency. Moreover, by considering the heterogeneous channel conditions and computing capabilities at edge devices, we jointly optimize subchannel allocation, power control, and cut layer selection to minimize the per-round latency. Simulation results show that the proposed EPSL framework significantly decreases the training latency needed to achieve a target accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art benchmarks, and the tailored resource management and layer split strategy can considerably reduce latency than the counterpart without optimization.

AB Although they are staple foods in cuisines globally, many commercial fruit varieties have become progressively less flavorful over time. Due to the cost and difficulty associated with flavor phenotyping, breeding programs have long been challenged in selecting for this complex trait. To address this issue, we leveraged targeted metabolomics of diverse tomato and blueberry accessions and their corresponding consumer panel ratings to create statistical and machine learning models that can predict sensory perceptions of fruit flavor. Using these models, a breeding program can assess flavor ratings for a large number of genotypes, previously limited by the low throughput of consumer sensory panels. The ability to predict consumer ratings of liking, sweet, sour, umami, and flavor intensity was evaluated by a 10-fold cross-validation, and the accuracies of 18 different models were assessed. The prediction accuracies were high for most attributes and ranged from 0.87 for sourness intensity in blueberry using XGBoost to 0.46 for overall liking in tomato using linear regression. Further, the bestperforming models were used to infer the flavor compounds (sugars, acids, and volatiles) that contribute most to each flavor attribute. We found that the variance decomposition of overall liking score estimates that 42% and 56% of the variance was explained by volatile organic compounds in tomato and blueberry, respectively. We expect that these models will enable an earlier incorporation of flavor as breeding targets and encourage selection and release of more flavorful fruit varieties.

AB Identification of best performing fertilizer practices with on-farm trials is challenging, in particular in rainfed farming due to weather uncertainty. However, it remains crucial to test a range of viable practices to ascertain their performances, given that they are not known beforehand. This process also involves the testing of practices that could potentially yield inferior results in comparison to the best available practice(s). To identify a best management practice, an "intuitive strategy" typically sets up multi-year, multi-location field trials, wherein each practice is tested in a proportionally equal manner over a set number of years. Our objective was to provide an identification strategy for nitrogen fertilizer management designing a bandit learning algorithm. We aimed for the bandit algorithm to be better at minimizing farmers' losses occurring from the testing of management practices that do not perform best, compared with the "intuitive strategy" that was formulized as the ExploreThen-Commit strategy. Our case study was for maize production in southern Mali. Bandit framework is a machine learning approach in which an agent learns from the feedback over time and accordingly selects actions in order to maximize its cumulative reward in the long term. To mimic the maize responses to nitrogen fertilization, we used the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop model. We compared nitrogen fertilizer practices using a risk-aware measure, the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), and a novel agronomic metric, the Yield Excess (YE). The YE accounts for both grain yield and agronomic nitrogen use efficiency. The bandit algorithm performed better than the intuitive strategy: it minimized farmers' yield losses during the identification process. This study is a methodological step which opens up new horizons for risk-aware identification of the performance of a range of crop management practices in real conditions.

AB Platelets play a critical role in blood clotting and the development of arterial blockages. Antiplatelet therapy is vital for preventing recurring events in conditions like coronary artery disease and strokes. However, there is a lack of comprehensive guidelines for using antiplatelet agents in elective neurosurgery. Continuing therapy during surgery poses a bleeding risk, while discontinuing it before surgery increases the risk of thrombosis. Discontinuation is recommended in neurosurgical settings but carries an elevated risk of ischemic events. Conversely, maintaining antithrombotic therapy may increase bleeding and the need for transfusions, leading to a poor prognosis. Artificial intelligence (AI) holds promise in making difficult decisions regarding antiplatelet therapy. This paper discusses current clinical guidelines and supported regimens for antiplatelet therapy in neurosurgery. It also explores methodologies like P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) monitoring and thromboelastography (TEG) mapping for monitoring the use of antiplatelet regimens as well as their limitations. The paper explores the potential of AI to overcome such limitations associated with PRU monitoring and TEG mapping. It highlights various studies in the field of cardiovascular and neuroendovascular surgery which use AI prediction models to forecast adverse outcomes such as ischemia and bleeding, offering assistance in decision-making for antiplatelet therapy. In addition, the use of AI to improve patient adherence to antiplatelet regimens is also considered. Overall, this research aims to provide insights into the use of antiplatelet therapy and the role of AI in optimizing treatment plans in neurosurgical settings.

   screening; seismic risk; soft-story buildings; street view images
AB In high seismic risk regions, it is important for city managers and decision makers to create programs to mitigate the risk for buildings. For large cities and regions, a mitigation program relies on accurate information of building stocks, that is, a database of all buildings in the area and their potential structural defects, making them vulnerable to strong ground shaking. Structural defects and vulnerabilities could manifest via the building's appearance. One such example is the soft-story building-its vertical irregularity is often observable from the facade. This structural type can lead to severe damage or even collapse during moderate or severe earthquakes. Therefore, it is critical to screen large building stock to find these buildings and retrofit them. However, it is usually time-consuming to screen soft-story structures by conventional methods. To tackle this issue, we used full image classification to screen them out from street view images in our previous study. However, full image classification has difficulties locating buildings in an image, which leads to unreliable predictions. In this paper, we developed an automated pipeline in which we segment street view images to identify soft-story buildings. However, annotated data for this purpose is scarce. To tackle this issue, we compiled a dataset of street view images and present a strategy for annotating these images in a semi-automatic way. The annotated dataset is then used to train an instance segmentation model that can be used to detect all soft-story buildings from unseen images.

ID LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; DECISION TREES; NEURAL-NETWORK; FALL RISK
AB ObjectiveThis study aimed to develop and validate predictive models using electronic health records (EHR) data to determine whether hospitalized COVID-19-positive patients would be admitted to alternative medical care or discharged home.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study using deidentified data from the University of Florida Health Integrated Data Repository. The study included 1,578 adult patients (>= 18 years) who tested positive for COVID-19 while hospitalized, comprising 960 (60.8%) female patients with a mean (SD) age of 51.86 (18.49) years and 618 (39.2%) male patients with a mean (SD) age of 54.35 (18.48) years. Machine learning (ML) model training involved cross-validation to assess their performance in predicting patient disposition.ResultsWe developed and validated six supervised ML-based prediction models (logistic regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, random forest, and support vector machine classifier) to predict patient discharge status. The models were evaluated based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC), precision, accuracy, F1 score, and Brier score. The random forest classifier exhibited the highest performance, achieving an accuracy of 0.84 and an AUC of 0.72. Logistic regression (accuracy: 0.85, AUC: 0.71), k-nearest neighbor (accuracy: 0.84, AUC: 0.63), decision tree (accuracy: 0.84, AUC: 0.61), Gaussian Naive Bayes (accuracy: 0.84, AUC: 0.66), and support vector machine classifier (accuracy: 0.84, AUC: 0.67) also demonstrated valuable predictive capabilities.SignificanceThis study's findings are crucial for efficiently allocating healthcare resources during pandemics like COVID-19. By harnessing ML techniques and EHR data, we can create predictive tools to identify patients at greater risk of severe symptoms based on their medical histories. The models developed here serve as a foundation for expanding the toolkit available to healthcare professionals and organizations. Additionally, explainable ML methods, such as Shapley Additive Explanations, aid in uncovering underlying data features that inform healthcare decision-making processes.

TI ThickBrick: optimal event selection and categorization in high energy
   physics. Part I. Signal discovery
SO JOURNAL OF HIGH ENERGY PHYSICS
LA English
DT Article
DE Supersymmetry Phenomenology
AB We provide a prescription called ThickBrick to train optimal machine-learning-based event selectors and categorizers that maximize the statistical significance of a potential signal excess in high energy physics (HEP) experiments, as quantified by any of six different performance measures. For analyses where the signal search is performed in the distribution of some event variables, our prescription ensures that only the information complementary to those event variables is used in event selection and categorization. This eliminates a major misalignment with the physics goals of the analysis (maximizing the significance of an excess) that exists in the training of typical ML-based event selectors and categorizers. In addition, this decorrelation of event selectors from the relevant event variables prevents the background distribution from becoming peaked in the signal region as a result of event selection, thereby ameliorating the challenges imposed on signal searches by systematic uncertainties. Our event selectors (categorizers) use the output of machine-learning-based classifiers as input and apply optimal selection cutoffs (categorization thresholds) that are functions of the event variables being analyzed, as opposed to flat cutoffs (thresholds). These optimal cutoffs and thresholds are learned iteratively, using a novel approach with connections to Lloyd's k-means clustering algorithm. We provide a public, Python implementation of our prescription, also called ThickBrick, along with usage examples.

TI PTR-CNN for in-loop filtering in video coding
SO JOURNAL OF VISUAL COMMUNICATION AND IMAGE REPRESENTATION
LA English
DT Article
DE Video coding; Blocking artifact; In-loop filter; Convolutional neural
   network; Image quality assessment
AB A deep learning method called PTR-CNN (Predicted frame with Transform unit partition and prediction Residual aided CNN) is proposed for in-loop filtering in video compression. To reduce the computational complexity of an end-to-end CNN in-loop filter, a non-learning method of reference frame selection is designed to select the highest quality frame based on the frame's blurriness and smoothiness scores. The transform unit (TU) partition and the prediction residual (PR) of the current frame are used as extra inputs to the neural network as the filtering guidance. The selected similar and high quality reference frame (RF) and the current unfiltered frame (CUF) are input to a CNN based motion compensation module to generate a predicted frame (PF). Finally input the PF, the CUF, the CUF's TU partition and the CUF's PR into the main CNN to reconstruct the filtered frame. The model is implemented in Tensorflow and tested in HEVC and AV1. Experimental results show that the complexity of proposed PTR-CNN is less than SOTA CNN-based reference aided in-loop filtering methods and slightly outperforms their RD performance. The scheme introduces a complexity overhead of 7% on the encoder. In particular, for random access, the proposed model achieves 11.78% coding gain over HEVC with DBF/SAO off, while has a gain of 4.76% over HEVC with DBF/SAO on. Ablation study demonstrates that the RF contributes about 10% of the total gain, and the TU and PR contribute over 4% of the total one, proving the effectiveness of each module. Moreover, it is observed that the proposed method can restore detailed structures and textures and hence improve the subjective quality.

AB Background and Aims: Alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) poses significant short-term mortality. Existing prognostic models lack precision for 90-day mortality. Utilizing artificial intelligence in a global cohort, we sought to derive and validate an enhanced prognostic model. Approach and Results: The Global AlcHep initiative, a retrospective study across 23 centers in 12 countries, enrolled patients with AH per National Institute for Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism criteria. Centers were partitioned into derivation (11 centers, 860 patients) and validation cohorts (12 centers, 859 patients). Focusing on 30 and 90-day postadmission mortality, 3 artificial intelligence algorithms (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machines, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting) informed an ensemble model, subsequently refined through Bayesian updating, integrating the derivation cohort's average 90-day mortality with each center's approximate mortality rate to produce posttest probabilities. The ALCoholic Hepatitis Artificial INtelligence Ensemble score integrated age, gender, cirrhosis, and 9 laboratory values, with center-specific mortality rates. Mortality was 18.7% (30 d) and 27.9% (90 d) in the derivation cohort versus 21.7% and 32.5% in the validation cohort. Validation cohort 30 and 90-day AUCs were 0.811 (0.779-0.844) and 0.799 (0.769-0.830), significantly surpassing legacy models like Maddrey's Discriminant Function, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease variations, age-serum bilirubin-international normalized ratio-serum Creatinine score, Glasgow, and modified Glasgow Scores (p < 0.001). ALCoholic Hepatitis Artificial INtelligence Ensemble score also showcased superior calibration against MELD and its variants. Steroid use improved 30-day survival for those with an ALCoholic Hepatitis Artificial INtelligence Ensemble score > 0.20 in both derivation and validation cohorts. Conclusions: Harnessing artificial intelligence within a global consortium, we pioneered a scoring system excelling over traditional models for 30 and 90-day AH mortality predictions.

AB Robots and artificial intelligence (AI) have seen increased adoption in healthcare. These health technologies have the capability of providing tailored messages and feedback to each individual. Thus, a robot can potentially serve as a personal health advisor, particularly for health issues that could be benefited through regular guidance and instructions. However, there is a limited understanding of how people might respond to the idea that their health advisor could be a robot. Thus, the present study employs the technology acceptance model (TAM) to examine intentions to adopt a robotic health advisor. Findings demonstrate that perceived ease of communication with and perceived usefulness of a robotic health advisor positively predict favorable attitudes toward a robotic health advisor, which subsequently leads to strong intentions to adopt it. The present investigation also finds that perceived usefulness of a robotic health advisor directly leads to an individual's intentions to adopt it. Overall, the present study provides important implications for perceptions of a robotic health advisor.

AB Meningiomas are among the most common brain tumors that arise from the leptomeningeal cover of the brain and spinal cord and account for around 37% of all central nervous system tumors. According to the World Health Organization, meningiomas are classified into three histological subtypes: benign, atypical, and anaplastic. Sometimes, meningiomas with a histological diagnosis of benign tumors show clinical characteristics and behavior of aggressive tumors. In this study, we examined the metabolomic and lipidomic profiles of meningioma tumors, focusing on comparing low-grade and high-grade tumors and identifying potential markers that can discriminate between benign and malignant tumors. High-resolution mass spectrometry coupled to liquid chromatography was used for untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics analyses of 85 tumor biopsy samples with different meningioma grades. We then applied feature selection and machine learning techniques to find the features with the highest information to aid in the diagnosis of meningioma grades. Three biomarkers were identified to differentiate low- and high-grade meningioma brain tumors. The use of mass-spectrometry-based metabolomics and lipidomics combined with machine learning analyses to prospect and characterize biomarkers associated with meningioma grades may pave the way for elucidating potential therapeutic and prognostic targets.

AB Dopamine signaling is thought to mediate reward-based learning. We tested for a role of dopamine in motor adaptation by administering the dopamine precursor levodopa to healthy participants in two experiments involving reaching movements. Levodopa has been shown to impair reward-based learning in cognitive tasks. Thus, we hypothesized that levodopa would selectively impair aspects of motor adaptation that depend on the reinforcement of rewarding actions. In the first experiment, participants performed two separate tasks in which adaptation was driven either by visual error-based feedback of the hand position or binary reward feedback. We used EEG to measure event-related potentials evoked by task feedback. We hypothesized that levodopa would specifically diminish adaptation and the neural responses to feedback in the reward learning task. However, levodopa did not affect motor adaptation in either task nor did it diminish event-related potentials elicited by reward outcomes. In the second experiment, participants learned to compensate for mechanical force field perturbations applied to the hand during reaching. Previous exposure to a particular force field can result in savings during subsequent adaptation to the same force field or interference during adaptation to an opposite force field. We hypothesized that levodopa would diminish savings and anterograde interference, as previous work suggests that these phenomena result from a reinforcement learning process. However, we found no reliable effects of levodopa. These results suggest that reward-based motor adaptation, savings, and interference may not depend on the same dopaminergic mechanisms that have been shown to be disrupted by levodopa during various cognitive tasks.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY Motor adaptation relies on multiple processes including reinforcement of successful actions. Cognitive reinforcement learning is impaired by levodopa-induced disruption of dopamine function. We administered levodopa to healthy adults who participated in multiple motor adaptation tasks. We found no effects of levodopa on any component of motor adaptation. This suggests that motor adaptation may not depend on the same dopaminergic mechanisms as cognitive forms or reinforcement learning that have been shown to be impaired by levodopa.

AB As a critical indicator of plant growth and water use, accurately and promptly estimating leaf area index (LAI) is critical for improved crop management. However, measuring LAI requires substantial effort and time . The main objective of this study was to leverage vegetation indices (VIs) generated from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)based images and machine learning (ML) techniques for estimating LAI of green beans and sweet corn. The research was conducted at the Tropical Research and Education Center (TREC), University of Florida, Homestead, Florida over three seasons from 2020-2023. The experiment for each crop consisted of four irrigation treatments, i.e., 100 % full irrigation (FI), 75 %, 50 %, and 25 % FI, with four replications. Destructive leaf samples were collected by cutting plants from 30 cm row length of two inner plot rows and leaf area (LA) was measured using a LI-3000C transparent belt conveyor. Plant height and canopy width were also measured biweekly. Moreover, a UAV-based RedEdge-MX sensor was employed throughout the seasons to collect high- resolution multispectral imageries that consist of five bands. Plant LAI was calculated using the plant density method from measured LA. A calibrated DSSAT model was used to simulate the LAI for both crops.. Simulated LAI from DSSAT was compared against measured LAI, and relationships were established between simulated LAI and 12 VIs generated from UAV images. Additionally, ML algorithms, i.e., random forest (RF), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGB), and light gradient boosting (LGB) models, were trained to predict LAI for both crops using VIs as input features. Results showed DSSAT's perfroamnce in simulating LAI was good for green beans and reasonable for sweet corn. Out of the 12 indices tested, six VIs, i.e., Enhanced Vegetation Index 2 (EVI2), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Green Red Difference Index (NGRDI), NIR-RE Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NIRRENDVI), Red-Edge Normalized Vegetation Index (RENDVI), and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) showed a good agreement with simulated LAI for both crops. The LGB, RF, and XGB models predicted LAI with acceptable accuracy, achieving r2 values of 0.78, 0.90, and 0.90 and RMSE values of 0.43, 0.29, and 0.28 for sweet corn and r2 of 0.72, 0.79, and 0.80 and RMSE of 1.01, 0.86, and 0.85 for green beans, respectively. The findings indicate that ML models and VIs derived from UAV imagery could be used to predict LAI with acceptable accuracy for green beans and sweet corn.

AB Purpose: This review describes ecosystem services (ES) obtained from grasslands within the southeastern United States. In addition, future direction and the importance of these ES to sustain productive agroecosystems are described.
   Sources: Results from published studies investigating various ES provided by grasslands within the southeastern United States are summarized in this article.
   Synthesis: Ecosystem services can be classified into 4 categories: provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural. Grasslands in the southeastern United States range from wet prairies in Florida, to transitional grasslands emerging from tallgrass prairie and longleaf pine ecosystems into coastal marshes in Texas. Provisioning ES from grasslands include animal products, timber, fruits, pods, and medicinal products. Supporting and regulating ES include nutrient cycling, biological nitrogen fixation, water catchment and purification, recharge of aquifers, climate regulation, primary productivity, habitat for wildlife and pollinators, and biodiversity. Grasslands are also important for aesthetic and cultural ES, including hunting leases and recreational parks.
   Conclusions and Applications: Grasslands in the southeastern United States have decreased due to urbanization, rising livestock production costs, and decreases in seed resources. Providing ES assessments will be important to assign value to grassland ecosystems, especially to increase adoption of novel management practices that may enhance delivery of ES. Remote sensing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence are promising tools to scale up the measurement of ES at landscape and watershed levels. In the future, ES will likely be a more prominent component of agroecosystems, and payment mechanisms will become more common to compensate landowners for the benefit they provide for the entire society.

AB Precisely recognizing DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) from sequences is crucial for a profound comprehension of the mechanisms governing protein-DNA interactions in various cellular processes. However, traditional in-silico methods for DBP identification encounter several challenges, such as time-consuming evolutionary modeling based on multiple sequence alignments, and intricate feature engineering associated with machine or deep learning approaches. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end predictor for identifying DNA-binding proteins without intricate feature engineering, which innovatively enriches the semantics of amino acid sequences through the fusion of bilingual representations derived from distinct language models. We further design a convolution scope expanding (CoSE) module to widen the receptive fields of convolution kernels, thereby forming protein-level CoSE representation sequences. These representations are subsequently integrated via BiLSTM in conjunction with a simplified capsule network, enhancing the hierarchical feature extraction capability. Extensive experiments confirm that our model surpasses existing baselines across diverse benchmark datasets, notably achieving at least a 5.1% improvement in MCC value on the UniSwiss dataset.

AB Building upon the communication privacy management theory, the research reveals the effect of self-disclosure on the identified mechanisms of perceived emotional value, performance expectancy, and privacy concerns, which in turn, influence customers' intention to compliment and complain via AI-enabled platforms. Findings from two quasi-experiments with 439 valid responses from U.S. customers suggest that customers are more likely to express their feelings when low self-disclosure AI technology is presented. The results suggest a prominent role of privacy concerns in mediating the effect of self-disclosure on customers' intention to compliment and complain. The effects of self-disclosure also channel through perceived emotional value and performance expectancy when customers want to leave a compliment. The moderating effect of reward timing was examined. Similarities and differences between customers' intentions to compliment or complain using AI-enabled platforms are discussed to provide theoretical and practical implications.

AB The distributions of input data are very important for learning machines, such as the convex universal learning machines (CULMs). The CULMs are a family of universal learning machines with convex optimization. However, the computational complexity is a crucial problem in CULMs, because the dimension of the nonlinear mapping layer (the hidden layer) of the CULMs is usually rather large in complex system modeling. In this article, we propose an efficient quantization method called Probability density Rank-based Quantization (PRQ) to decrease the computational complexity of CULMs. The PRQ ranks the data according to the estimated probability densities and then selects a subset whose elements are equally spaced in the ranked data sequence. We apply the PRQ to kernel ridge regression (KRR) and random Fourier feature recursive least squares (RFF-RLS), which are two typical algorithms of CULMs. The proposed method not only keeps the similarity of data distribution between the code book and data set but also reduces the computational cost by using the kd-tree. Meanwhile, for a given data set, the method yields deterministic quantization results, and it can also exclude the outliers and avoid too many borders in the code book. This brings great convenience to practical applications of the CULMs. The proposed PRQ is evaluated on several real-world benchmark data sets. Experimental results show satisfactory performance of PRQ compared with some state-of-the-art methods.

AB In this letter, we propose a point cloud structural similarity-based loop detection method for underwater Simultaneous Localization and Mapping using sonar sensors. Existing sonar-based loop detection approaches often rely on 2D projection and keypoint extraction, which can lead to data loss and poor performance in feature-scarce environments. Additionally, methods based on neural networks or Bag-of-Words require extensive preprocessing, such as model training or vocabulary creation, reducing adaptability to new environments. To address these challenges, our method directly utilizes 3D sonar point clouds without projection and computes point-wise structural feature maps based on geometry, normals, and curvature. By leveraging rotation-invariant similarity comparisons, the proposed approach eliminates the need for keypoint detection and ensures robust loop detection across diverse underwater terrains. We validate our method using two real-world datasets: the Antarctica dataset obtained from deep underwater and the Seaward dataset collected from rivers and lakes. Experimental results show that our method achieves the highest loop detection performance compared to existing keypoint-based and learning-based approaches while requiring no additional training or preprocessing.

AB Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) pose significant environmental and health risks due to their unique physicochemical properties, which influence their environmental fate and transport. This study investigates presence of PFAS in biweekly surface water samples from 17 sites in the Indian River Lagoon (IRL) in Brevard County, FL, using Classification and Regression Trees (CART), a machine-learning method, and incorporates seven environmental stressors (salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, water temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and river discharge). CART analysis revealed salinity as a crucial factor associated with the occurrence of PFAS throughout the IRL, which can be attributed to PFAS sorption behaviors at the water-solid interface and the water residence time at the lagoon. In addition, it highlights better predictive accuracy for long-chain carboxylic PFAS compounds. The performance of the CART analysis yielded average sensitivity and specificity values of similar to 87 and similar to 57%, respectively. These findings offer valuable insights for future studies leveraging machine-learning approaches to swiftly and systematically identify areas with increased PFAS occurrence in water systems. This approach represents a crucial first step in the implementation of machine-learning to assess PFAS exposure risks in aquatic environments, suggesting the need for targeted monitoring and interventions based on identified environmental stressors.

AB Resting state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) is increasingly used for the identification of image biomarkers of brain diseases or psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia. This paper deals with the application of ensembles of Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) to build Computer Aided Diagnosis systems on the basis of features extracted from the activity measures computed over rs-fMRI data. The power of ELM to provide quick but near optimal solutions to the training of Single Layer Feedforward Networks (SLFN) allows extensive exploration of discriminative power of feature spaces in affordable time with off-the-shelf computational resources. Exploration is performed in this paper by an evolutionary search approach that has found functional activity map features allowing to achieve quite successful classification experiments, providing biologically plausible voxel-site localizations.

AB While fact-checking has received much attention as a tool to fight misinformation online, fact-checking efforts have yielded limited success in combating political misinformation due to partisans' biased information processing. The efficacy of fact-checking often decreases, if not backfires, when the fact-checking messages contradict individual audiences' political stance. To explore ways to minimize such politically biased processing of fact-checking messages, an online experiment (N = 645) examined how different source labels of fact-checking messages (human experts vs. AI vs. crowdsourcing vs. human experts-AI hybrid) influence partisans' processing of fact-checking messages. Results showed that AI and crowdsourcing source labels significantly reduced motivated reasoning in evaluating the credibility of fact-checking messages whereas the partisan bias remained evident for the human experts and human experts-AI hybrid source labels.

AB We introduce certain concepts and expressions from conceptual density functional theory (DFT) to study the properties of the Hildebrand solubility parameter. The original form of the Hildebrand solubility parameter is used to qualitatively estimate solubilities for various apolar and aprotic substances and solvents and is based on the square root of the cohesive energy density. Our results show that a revised expression allows the replacement of cohesive energy densities by electrophilicity densities, which are numerically accessible by simple DFT calculations. As an extension, the reformulated expression provides a deeper interpretation of the main contributions and, in particular, emphasizes the importance of charge transfer mechanisms. All calculated values of the Hildebrand parameters for a large number of common solvents are compared with experimental values and show good agreement for non- or moderately polar aprotic solvents in agreement with the original formulation of the Hildebrand solubility parameters. The observed deviations for more polar and protic solvents define robust limits from the original formulation which remain valid. Likewise, we show that the use of machine learning methods leads to only slightly better predictability.
   We derive a new expression for the Hildebrand Solubility Parameter and show that the corresponding values for different solvents can be calculated with the help of conceptual DFT calculations in good agreement with experimental results.**image

AB In many applications, developed deep-learning models need to be iteratively debugged and refined to improve the model efficiency over time. Debugging some models, such as temporal multilabel classification (TMLC) where each data point can simultaneously belong to multiple classes, can be especially more challenging due to the complexity of the analysis and instances that need to be reviewed. In this article, focusing on video activity recognition as an application of TMLC, we propose DETOXER, an interactive visual debugging system to support finding different error types and scopes through providing multiscope explanations.

ID ADVANCED LIGO
AB The quest to observe gravitational waves challenges our ability to discriminate signals from detector noise. This issue is especially relevant for transient gravitational waves searches with a robust eyes wide open approach, the so called all-sky burst searches. Here we show how signal classification methods inspired by broad astrophysical characteristics can be implemented in all-sky burst searches preserving their generality. In our case study, we apply a multivariate analyses based on artificial neural networks to classify waves emitted in compact binary coalescences. We enhance by orders of magnitude the significance of signals belonging to this broad astrophysical class against the noise background. Alternatively, at a given level of mis-classification of noise events, we can detect about 1/4 more of the total signal population. We also show that a more general strategy of signal classification can actually be performed, by testing the ability of artificial neural networks in discriminating different signal classes. The possible impact on future observations by the LIGO-Virgo network of detectors is discussed by analysing recoloured noise from previous LIGO-Virgo data with coherent WaveBurst, one of the flagship pipelines dedicated to all-sky searches for transient gravitational waves.

AB The purpose of this research study was to examine the overall effect of adaptive learning systems deployed using artificial intelligence technology across a range of relevant variables (e.g., duration, student level, etc.). Following a systematic procedure, this meta-analysis examined literature from 18 academic databases and identified N = 45 independent studies utilizing AI-enabled adaptive learning. This meta-analysis examined the overall effect of AI-enabled adaptive learning systems on students' cognitive learning outcomes when compared with non-adaptive learning interventions and found that they have a medium to large positive effect size (g = 0.70). The effect was significantly moderated by publication type, origin of study, student classification level, student discipline, duration, and research design. In addition, all three adaptive sources (cognitive, affective, and behavioral) and adaptive targets (navigation and assessment) were significant moderators.

AB PurposeThis study aims to propose a risk-induced game theoretic forecasting model to predict average daily rate (ADR) under COVID-19, using an advanced recurrent neural network. Design/methodology/approachUsing three data sets from upper-midscale hotels in three locations (i.e. urban, interstate and suburb), from January 1, 2018, to August 31, 2020, three long-term, short-term memory (LSTM) models were evaluated against five traditional forecasting models. FindingsThe models proposed in this study outperform traditional methods, such that the simplest LSTM model is more accurate than most of the benchmark models in two of the three tested hotels. In particular, the results show that traditional methods are inefficient in hotels with rapid fluctuations of demand and ADR, as observed during the pandemic. In contrast, LSTM models perform more accurately for these hotels. Research limitations/implicationsThis study is limited by its use of American data and data from midscale hotels as well as only predicting ADR. Practical implicationsThis study produced a reliable, accurate forecasting model considering risk and competitor behavior. Theoretical implicationsThis paper extends the application of game theory principles to ADR forecasting and combines it with the concept of risk for forecasting during uncertain times. Originality/valueThis study is the first study, to the best of the authors' knowledge, to use actual hotel data from the COVID-19 pandemic to determine an appropriate neural network forecasting method for times of uncertainty. The application of Shapley value and operational risk obtained a game-theoretic property-level model, which fits best.

AB Remaining useful lifetime (RUL) prediction based on degradation signals of sensors is of critical importance in the prognostics and health management (PHM) of machines in manufacturing systems. The machines are often under the same operational and environmental conditions and thus show dependent but heterogeneous degradation profiles. However, many existing studies ignored these characteristics among machines, leading to poor RUL prediction results especially when missing data exists. To address this issue, this article develops a latent variable-based multitask learning (LVMTL) approach for degradation modeling and prognostics of machines based on multiple sensor signals. Specifically, we first adopt a polynomial model to fit the degradation processes of machines' health indices (HIs), which are estimated based on multiple sensor signals. Taking the HIs as latent variables, we develop an LVMTL model aiming to capture the dependency and heterogeneity among machines. For parameter estimation, we develop a unique iterated quadratic optimization-integrated expectation-maximum (QOIEM) algorithm that updates model parameters via quadratic programming (QP) and maximum a posteriori-based expectation-maximum (MAP-EM) considering the principles for estimating an HI. The QOIEM has been proven to have satisfactory convergence performance in theory in this study. Numerical experiments and a real case study on aircraft turbine engines have been implemented to compare the prognosis performance and robustness of incomplete datasets for the proposed and benchmark methods.

AB Aims: The aim of this study was to develop a predictive model that can identify the suicidal ideation risk group among older adults in rural areas using machine learning methods.Design: This study applied an exploratory, descriptive and cross-sectional design.Methods: The participants were older adults (N = 650) aged over 65 living in rural areas of South Korea. Self-report questionnaires were used to collect the demographics, suicidal ideation, depression, socioeconomic information and basic health information from September to October 2020. The collected data were analysed using machine learning methods with R statistical software 4.1.0.Results: The predictive models indicated that depression, pain, age and loneliness were significant factors of suicidal ideation. Good performance was observed based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in the decision tree, random forest and logistic regression. Finally, the evaluation of model performance indicated moderate to high sensitivity and specificity.Conclusion: The predictive models using machine learning methods may be useful to predict the risk of suicidal ideation. Furthermore, depression with pain, age and feelings of loneliness should be included in the initial screening to assess suicide risk among older adults in rural areas.Impact: Identifying suicidal risk among older adults is challenging. Thus, employing predictive models that can assess depression, pain, age and loneliness can enable public healthcare providers to detect suicidal risk groups. Particularly, the presented models from this study can facilitate healthcare providers with initiating early interventions to prevent suicide among older adults in clinical and community nursing care settings.Reporting Method: The reporting of this study (Observational, cross-sectional study) conforms to the STROBE statement.Patient or Public Contribution: No patient or public contribution. This study did not involve patients, service users, caregivers or members of the public.Implication for the Profession and/or Patients Care: Applying this model may help to prevent geriatric suicide because the nursing staff will have a greater awareness regarding the suicide ideation risk of older adults, thereby reducing the possibility of their suicide.

TI MOOC Dropout Prediction Using a Hybrid Algorithm Based on Decision Tree
   and Extreme Learning Machine
SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
LA English
DT Article
AB Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have boomed in recent years because learners can arrange learning at their own pace. High dropout rate is a universal but unsolved problem in MOOCs. Dropout prediction has received much attention recently. A previous study reported the problem of learning behavior discrepancy leading to a wide range of fluctuation of prediction results. Besides, previous methods require iterative training which is time intensive. To address these problems, we propose DT-ELM, a novel hybrid algorithm combining decision tree and extreme learning machine (ELM), which requires no iterative training. The decision tree selects features with good classification ability. Further, it determines enhanced weights of the selected features to strengthen their classification ability. To achieve accurate prediction results, we optimize ELM structure by mapping the decision tree to ELM based on the entropy theory. Experimental results on the benchmark KDD 2015 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of DT-ELM, which is 12.78%, 22.19%, and 6.87% higher than baseline algorithms in terms of accuracy, AUC, and F1-score, respectively.

DE Deep learning; Model calibration; Trustworthy AI
AB Deep learning has achieved the state-of-the-art performance across medical imaging tasks; however, model calibration is often not considered. Uncalibrated models are potentially dangerous in high-risk applications since the user does not know when they will fail. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel domain-aware loss function to calibrate deep learning models. The proposed loss function applies a class-wise penalty based on the similarity between classes within a given target domain. Thus, the approach improves the calibration while also ensuring that the model makes less risky errors even when incorrect. The code for this software is available at https://github.com/lab-smile/DOMINO.

DT Article
DE human skill modeling; performance optimization; human control strategy;
   neural networks
AB Modeling human control strategy (HCS) is becoming an increasingly popular paradigm a number of different research areas, ranging from robotics and intelligent vehicle highway systems to expert training and virtual reality computer games. Usually, HCS models are derived empirically, rather than analytically, from real-time human input-output data. While these empirical models offer an effective means of transferring intelligent behaviors from humans to robots and other machines, there is a great need to develop adequate performance criteria for these models. It is our goal in this paper to develop several such criteria for the task of human driving. We first collect driving data from different individuals through a real-time graphic driving simulator that we have developed, and identify each individual's control strategy model through the flexible cascade neural network learning architecture. We then define performance measures for evaluating two aspects of the resultant HCS models. The first is based on event analysis, while the second is based on inherent analysis. Using the proposed performance criteria, we demonstrate the procedure for evaluating the relative skill of different HCS models. Finally, we propose an iterative algorithm for optimizing an initially stable HCS model with respect to independent, user-specified performance criteria, by applying the simultaneously perturbed stochastic approximation (SPSA) algorithm. The methods proposed herein offer a means for modeling and transferring HCS in response to real-time inputs, and improving the intelligent behaviors of artificial machines.

AB AI has become increasingly relevant to the media sector, especially for news media companies considering the integration of this technology into their production processes. While the application of AI promises productivity gains, the impact on consumers' perceptions of the resulting news and the level of AI integration accepted by the market has not been well studied. Our research focused on the analysis of news consumers' preferred level of AI integration, AI news trust, and AI news usage intentions linked to the application of the technology in the discovery/information-gathering and writing/editing phases. By connecting a comprehensive set of factors influencing the perception of news and AI, we approached this gap through structural equation modeling, presenting an overview of consumers' responses to AI integration into news production processes. Our research showed that while participants generally prefer lower levels of AI integration into both phases of production, news trust and usage intention can even increase as AI enters the production process-as long as humans remain in the lead. These findings provide researchers and news media managers with a first overview of consumers' responses to news production augmentation and its implications for news perception in the market.

TI ASSUMING THE RISKS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
SO BOSTON UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID ASSUMPTION
AB Tort law has long served as a remedy for those injured by products and injuries from artificial intelligence ("AI") are no exception. While many scholars have rightly contemplated the possible tort claims involving AI-driven technologies that cause injury, there has been little focus on the subsequent analysis of defenses. One of these defenses, assumption of risk, has been given particularly short shrift, with most scholars addressing it only in passing. This is intriguing, particularly because assumption of risk has the power to completely bar recovery for a plaintiff who knowingly and voluntarily engaged with a risk. In reality, such a defense may prove vital to shaping the likelihood of success for these prospective plaintiffs injured by AI, first-adopters who are often eager to "voluntarily" use the new technology but simultaneously often lacking in "knowledge" about AI's risks.
   To remedy this oversight in the scholarship, this Article tackles assumption of risk head-on, demonstrating why this defense may have much greater influence on the course of the burgeoning new field of "AI torts" than originally believed. It analyzes the historic application of assumption of risk to emerging technologies, extrapolating its potential use in the context of damages caused by robotic, autonomous, and facial recognition technologies. This Article then analyzes assumption of risk's relationship to informed consent, another key doctrine that revolves around appreciation of risks, demonstrating how an extension of informed consent principles to assumption of risk can establish a more nuanced approach for a future that is sure to involve an increasing number of AI-human interactions-and AI torts. In addition to these AI-human interactions, this Article's reevaluation also can help in other assumption of risk analyses and tort law generally to better address the evolving innovation-risk-consent trilemma.

AB Oculomics is an emerging field that leverages ophthalmic imaging data to identify biomarkers of systemic disease, facilitating early diagnosis and risk stratification. Despite its growing recognition, gaps remain in the literature regarding the clinical applications of oculomics. Various systemic diseases-including metabolic disorders (e.g., diabetes mellitus), infectious diseases (e.g., COVID-19), neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., dementia), hematologic disorders (e.g., thalassemia), autoimmune conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis), and genetic syndromes (e.g., Fabry disease)-exhibit ocular manifestations detectable through in vivo confocal microscopy and anterior segment optical coherence tomography, among other imaging modalities. Increasing evidence supports the role of corneal imaging in identifying systemic disease biomarkers, a process further enhanced by artificial intelligence-driven analyses. This review synthesizes the current findings on corneal biomarkers of systemic disease, their ophthalmic imaging correlates, and the expanding role of corneal oculomics in translational medicine. Additionally, we explore future directions for integrating oculomics into clinical practice and biomedical research.

AB Background: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), advanced fibrosis, and subsequent cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma are becoming the most common etiology for liver failure and liver transplantation; however, they can only be diagnosed at these potentially reversible stages with a liver biopsy, which is associated with various complications and high expenses. Knowing the difference between the more benign isolated steatosis and the more severe NASH and cirrhosis informs the physician regarding the need for more aggressive management.
   Objective: We intend to explore the feasibility of using machine learning methods for noninvasive diagnosis of NASH and advanced liver fibrosis and compare machine learning methods with existing quantitative risk scores.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of clinical data from a cohort of 492 patients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), NASH, or advanced fibrosis. We systematically compared 5 widely used machine learning algorithms for the prediction of NAFLD, NASH, and fibrosis using 2 variable encoding strategies. Then, we compared the machine learning methods with 3 existing quantitative scores and identified the important features for prediction using the SHapley Additive exPlanations method.
   Results: The best machine learning method, gradient boosting (GB), achieved the best area under the curve scores of 0.9043, 0.8166, and 0.8360 for NAFLD, NASH, and advanced fibrosis, respectively. GB also outperformed 3 existing risk scores for fibrosis. Among the variables, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), triglyceride (TG), and BMI were the important risk factors for the prediction of NAFLD, whereas aspartate transaminase (AST), ALT, and TG were the important variables for the prediction of NASH, and AST, hyperglycemia (A(1c)), and high-density lipoprotein were the important variables for predicting advanced fibrosis.
   Conclusions: It is feasible to use machine learning methods for predicting NAFLD, NASH, and advanced fibrosis using routine clinical data, which potentially can be used to better identify patients who still need liver biopsy. Additionally, understanding the relative importance and differences in predictors could lead to improved understanding of the disease process as well as support for identifying novel treatment options.

ID CATEGORIZATION
AB Background: The advent of deep learning technologies has expanded the utilization of convolutional neural networks in diagnosing and segmenting plant leaf diseases. However, the segmentation of lesions, especially those with diverse sizes and shapes, often requires extensive pixel-level annotations.Objective: This study aims to introduce a multiscale U-network for effective concurrent segmentation and diagnosis of tomato leaf lesions.Methods: Our model employs multi-scale residual modules to adapt dynamically to diseases that alter lesion size and shape. The Classifier and Bridge (CB) module is introduced to connect the disease feature extraction stage with the disease spot segmentation stage, providing crucial information about a specific lesion type. During the segmentation stage, the activation map of a specific class is deconvoluted using a combination of up-sampling and convolution. This deconvolution feature is fused with the low-level feature through a skip connection strategy. A limited number of pixel-level labels are used, and the binary cross-entropy loss function is applied for supervised training at each pixel point, directing the feature extraction network to focus on the lesion location. Results: The model was evaluated using an original test set and an interference test set simulating noise and light intensity changes. The multiscale U-network demonstrated an average pixel accuracy of approximately 99.2%, a resilience to brightness reduction by about 92.4%, and an ability to handle up to 0.98 salt and pepper noise at a rate of about 99.2%, showcasing its robustness against various image alterations. The GFLOPs for the proposed method was found to be approximately 3.13e+06, indicating its computational efficiency.Conclusion: The experimental results highlight the potential of the proposed multiscale U-network in effectively segmenting and identifying lesions in tomato leaf tissue. These findings suggest promising opportunities for applying this model in the broader field of agricultural disease management.

AB Phishing and disinformation are popular social engineering attacks with attackers invariably applying influence cues in texts to make them more appealing to users. We introduce Lumen, a learning-based framework that exposes influence cues in text: (i) persuasion, (ii) framing, (iii) emotion, (iv) objectivity/subjectivity, (v) guilt/blame, and (vi) use of emphasis. Lumen was trained with a newly developed dataset of 3K texts comprised of disinformation, phishing, hyperpartisan news, and mainstream news. Evaluation of Lumen in comparison to other learning models showed that Lumen and LSTM presented the best F1-micro score, but Lumen yielded better interpretability. Our results highlight the promise of ML to expose influence cues in text, toward the goal of application in automatic labeling tools to improve the accuracy of human-based detection and reduce the likelihood of users falling for deceptive online content.

While the disease remains quiescent before harvest, its symptoms become evident during the postharvest period. This dormant behavior poses a challenge in managing fruits after harvest. To effectively detect asymptomatic fruit and detect SER disease at an early stage, it's crucial to identify early-stage biomarkers that can serve as disease indicators. In this study, a machine learning-based metabolomics analysis was utilized to identify characteristic metabolites and to elucidate the underlying biosynthetic mechanisms. Six machine learning algorithms were used, and Gradient boosting (GBT) exhibited the highest accuracy identifying early biomarkers such as shikimate, succinic acid, quinic acid, coumaric acid, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan. Moreover, dynamic time warping (DTW), was used to investigate the trend of metabolites across timepoints. Our result revealed that the metabolic analysis enabled differentiating infected from non-infected fruits within 1 day, even though symptoms appeared after 7 days of inoculation. Pathway enrichment analysis indicated that three pathways (biosynthesis of plant hormones, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and glutamate metabolism) were strongly involved in the defense mechanism. Metabolite mapping analysis showed the behavior of each compound against the pathogen. With these novel strategies, our findings suggest a prediction model for identifying asymptomatic grapefruit affected by Diplodia SER.

AB In order to move toward efficient autonomous learning, we must have control over our datasets to test and adaptively train systems for complex problems such as Visual Question Answering (VQA). Thus, we created a testing environment around MNIST images with optional cluttering. Although less complex than publicly available VQA datasets, the new environment generates datasets that decouple answers from questions and incorporate abstract ideas (content, context, and arithmetic) that must be learned. In addition, we analyze the performance of merged CNNs and LSTMs using the environment while exploring different ways to incorporate pretrained object classifiers. We demonstrate the usefulness of our environment as well as provide insight on the limitations of simple architectures and the complexities of different questions. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB For a well-established digital library (e.g., PubMed), searching in terms of a newly established ontology (e.g., Gene Ontology (GO)) is an extremely difficult task. Making such a digital library adaptive to any new ontology or to reorganize knowledge automatically is our main objective. The decomposition of the knowledge base into classes is a first step toward our main objective. In this paper, we will demonstrate an automated linking scheme for PubMed citations with GO terms using an improved version of extreme learning machine (ELM) type algorithms. ELM is an emergent technology, which has shown excellent performance in large data classification problems, with fast learning speeds.

AB Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is a highly polymorphic gene whose protein product metabolizes more than 20% of clinically used drugs. Genetic variations in CYP2D6 are responsible for interindividual heterogeneity in drug response that can lead to drug toxicity and ineffective treatment, making CYP2D6 one of the most important pharmacogenes. Prediction of CYP2D6 phenotype relies on curation of literature-derived functional studies to assign a functional status to CYP2D6 haplotypes. As the number of large-scale sequencing efforts grows, new haplotypes continue to be discovered, and assignment of function is challenging to maintain. To address this challenge, we have trained a convolutional neural network to predict functional status of CYP2D6 haplotypes, called Hubble.2D6. Hubble.2D6 predicts haplotype function from sequence data and was trained using two pre-training steps with a combination of real and simulated data. We find that Hubble.2D6 predicts CYP2D6 haplotype functional status with 88% accuracy in a held-out test set and explains 47.5% of the variance in in vitro functional data among star alleles with unknown function. Hubble.2D6 may be a useful tool for assigning function to haplotypes with uncurated function, and used for screening individuals who are at risk of being poor metabolizers.
   Author summary
   CYP2D6 is an enzyme expressed in the liver that is responsible for metabolizing more than 20% of clinically used drugs. The gene that encodes CYP2D6 is highly polymorphic, with more than 130 haplotypes currently known. Genetic variants in CYP2D6 can drastically affect how an individual responds to pharmaceuticals metabolized by CYP2D6, affecting both drug safety and efficacy. Guidelines have been developed to help providers better prescribe drugs using CYP2D6 genotype, but because of the numerous variants that have been identified in CYP2D6 these guidelines aren't suitable for all patients. The guidelines rely on the fact that the metabolic function of CYP2D6 haplotypes is known, however, this is not the case for more than half of all existing haplotypes. Currently, we rely on human curation of haplotypes to assess function, but as genome sequencing has become routine the number of haplotypes identified has grown rapidly, making human curation untenable. We have developed a system using machine learning, named Hubble.2D6, that seeks to address this problem by making predictions of metabolic function for CYP2D6 haplotypes. We trained a deep learning model using very little data by first pretraining the model on simulated data, allowing for the use of a complex model in a domain that is typically data limited. We find that Hubble.2D6 predicts haplotype function with high accuracy and that the predictions correlate with in vitro functional characterization. We believe that this predictive model can be helpful in assessing function of CYP2D6 haplotypes with unknown function, and that the method of pretraining on simulated data may be useful in other domains within genetics.

TI CONTRAST EFFECTS IN FLAVOR PREFERENCE LEARNING
SO QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY SECTION B-COMPARATIVE AND
   PHYSIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB In four experiments the role of contrast effects in producing learned flavour preferences was examined. The experiments showed that contrast effects are pervasive in flavour preference learning, producing results that are often paradoxical from a traditional reinforcement point of view. In Experiment 1, rats preferred a reinforced flavour over a nonreinforced flavour more if the reinforcer was 1% sucrose than if the reinforcer was 8% sucrose. Because the cue flavour was dissolved in 8% sucrose,  this represents an anticipatory positive contrast effect. In Experiment 2, the relationship between cue and consequence was shown to be important in flavour preference learning, as expected if contrast effects are involved. In Experiment 3, rats preferred a flavour that was reinforced 4 times, and they preferred this flavour more than one reinforced 8 times, presumably because the greater the expectancy of the consequence, the greater the anticipatory negative contrast. In Experiment 4, rats  consumed less of 0.15% saccharin if they received 32% sucrose randomly 90 min either before or after the 0.15% saccharin than if they received only 0.15% saccharin, a simultaneous negative contrast effect.

AB Opinion spammers exploit consumer trust by posting false or deceptive reviews that may have a negative impact on both consumers and businesses. These dishonest posts are difficult to detect because of complex interactions between several user characteristics, such as review velocity, volume, and variety. We propose a novel hierarchical supervised-learning approach to increase the likelihood of detecting anomalies by analyzing several user features and then characterizing their collective behavior in a unified manner. Specifically, we model user characteristics and interactions among them as univariate and multivariate distributions. We then stack these distributions using several supervised-learning techniques, such as logistic regression, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors yielding robust meta-classifiers. We perform a detailed evaluation of methods and then develop empirical insights. This approach is of interest to online business platforms because it can help reduce false reviews and increase consumer confidence in the credibility of their online information. Our study contributes to the literature by incorporating distributional aspects of features in machine-learning techniques, which can improve the performance of fake reviewer detection on digital platforms.

AB As medicine enters the era of artificial intelligence (AI)-augmented practice, dermatology is beginning to witness the integration of AI into the daily practice, particularly in the areas of diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of skin diseases. Many of the current electronic medical records that dermatologists have incorporated provide guidance in billing, a form of AI at work. The recent advances in visual recognition AI make application and integration of the technology particularly suited for perceptual specialties such as radiology and dermatology. In dermatology, AI is poised to improve the efficiency and accuracy of traditional diagnostic approaches, including visual examination, skin biopsy, and histopathologic examination. This review highlights the current progress of AI in dermatology and provides a basic overview of the technology. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI PIMA-CT: Physical Model-Aware Cyclic Simulation and Denoising for

AB A body of studies has proposed to obtain high-quality images from low-dose and noisy Computed Tomography (CT) scans for radiation reduction. However, these studies are designed for population-level data without considering the variation in CT devices and individuals, limiting the current approaches' performance, especially for ultra-low-dose CT imaging. Here, we proposed PIMA-CT, a physical anthropomorphic phantom model integrating an unsupervised learning framework, using a novel deep learning technique called Cyclic Simulation and Denoising (CSD), to address these limitations. We first acquired paired low-dose and standard-dose CT scans of the phantom and then developed two generative neural networks: noise simulator and denoiser. The simulator extracts real low-dose noise and tissue features from two separate image spaces (e.g., low-dose phantom model scans and standard-dose patient scans) into a unified feature space. Meanwhile, the denoiser provides feedback to the simulator on the quality of the generated noise. In this way, the simulator and denoiser cyclically interact to optimize network learning and ease the denoiser to simultaneously remove noise and restore tissue features. We thoroughly evaluate our method for removing both real low-dose noise and Gaussian simulated low-dose noise. The results show that CSD outperforms one of the state-of-the-art denoising algorithms without using any labeled data (actual patients' low-dose CT scans) nor simulated low-dose CT scans. This study may shed light on incorporating physical models in medical imaging, especially for ultra-low level dose CT scans restoration.

AB We present a data-driven, in situ proximal multi-sensor digital soil mapping approach to develop digital twins for multiple agricultural fields. A novel Digital Soil CoreTM (DSC) Probe was engineered that contains seven sensors, each of a distinct modality, including sleeve friction, tip force, dielectric permittivity, electrical resistivity, soil imagery, acoustics, and visible and near-infrared spectroscopy. The DSC System integrates the DSC Probe, DSC software (v2023.10), and deployment equipment components to sense soil characteristics at a high vertical spatial resolution (mm scale) along in situ soil profiles up to a depth of 120 cm in about 60 s. The DSC Probe in situ proximal data are harmonized into a data cube providing vertical high-density knowledge associated with physical-chemical-biological soil conditions. In contrast, conventional ex situ soil samples derived from soil cores, soil pits, or surface samples analyzed using laboratory and other methods are bound by a substantially coarser spatial resolution and multiple compounding errors. Our objective was to investigate the effects of the mismatched scale between high-resolution in situ proximal sensor data and coarser-resolution ex situ soil laboratory measurements to develop soil prediction models. Our study was conducted in central California soil in almond orchards. We collected DSC sensor data and spatially co-located soil cores that were sliced into narrow layers for laboratory-based soil measurements. Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) cross-validation was used to compare the results of testing four data integration methods. Method A reduced the high-resolution sensor data to discrete values paired with layer-based soil laboratory measurements. Method B used stochastic distributions of sensor data paired with layer-based soil laboratory measurements. Method C allocated the same soil analytical data to each one of the high-resolution multi-sensor data within a soil layer. Method D linked the high-density multi-sensor soil data directly to crop responses (crop performance and behavior metrics), bypassing costly laboratory soil analysis. Overall, the soil models derived from Method C outperformed Methods A and B. Soil predictions derived using Method D were the most cost-effective for directly assessing soil-crop relationships, making this method well suited for industrial-scale precision agriculture applications.

AB Objective:We test the hypothesis that for low-acuity surgical patients, postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) admission is associated with lower value of care compared with ward admission. Background:Overtriaging low-acuity patients to ICU consumes valuable resources and may not confer better patient outcomes. Associations among postoperative overtriage, patient outcomes, costs, and value of care have not been previously reported. Methods:In this longitudinal cohort study, postoperative ICU admissions were classified as overtriaged or appropriately triaged according to machine learning-based patient acuity assessments and requirements for immediate postoperative mechanical ventilation or vasopressor support. The nearest neighbors algorithm identified risk-matched control ward admissions. The primary outcome was value of care, calculated as inverse observed-to-expected mortality ratios divided by total costs. Results:Acuity assessments had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.92 in generating predictions for triage classifications. Of 8592 postoperative ICU admissions, 423 (4.9%) were overtriaged. These were matched with 2155 control ward admissions with similar comorbidities, incidence of emergent surgery, immediate postoperative vital signs, and do not resuscitate order placement and rescindment patterns. Compared with controls, overtraiged admissions did not have a lower incidence of any measured complications. Total costs for admission were $16.4K for overtriage and $15.9K for controls (P=0.03). Value of care was lower for overtriaged admissions [2.9 (2.0-4.0)] compared with controls [24.2 (14.1-34.5), PConclusions:Low-acuity postoperative patients who were overtriaged to ICUs had increased total costs, no improvements in outcomes, and received low-value care.

AB Participant selection is a fundamental research issue in Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS). Previous approaches commonly assume that adequately long periods of candidate participants' historical mobility trajectories are available to model their patterns before the selection process, which is not realistic for some new MCS applications or platforms. The sparsity or even absence of mobility traces will incur inaccurate location prediction, thus undermining the deployment of new MCS applications. To this end, this paper investigates a novel problem called "From-Scratch MCS" (FS-MCS for short), in which we study how to intelligently select participants to minimize such a "cold-start" effect. Specifically, we propose a novel framework based on reinforcement learning, named RL-Recruiter+. With the gradual accumulation of mobility trajectories over time, RL-Recruiter+ is able to make a good sequence of participant selection decisions for each sensing slot. Compared to its previous version, RL-Recruiter, Re-Recruiter+ jointly considers both the previous coverage and current mobility predictability when training the participant selection decision model. We evaluate our approach experimentally based on two real-world mobility datasets. The results demonstrate that RL-Recruiter+ outperforms the baseline approaches, including RL-Recruiter under various settings.

AB Machine learning (ML) methods have reached high accuracy levels for the prediction of in vacuo molecular properties. However, the simulation of large systems solely through ML methods (such as those based on neural network potentials) is still a challenge. In this context, one of the most promising frameworks for integrating ML schemes in the simulation of complex molecular systems are the so-called ML/MM methods. These multiscale approaches combine ML methods with classical force fields (MM), in the same spirit as the successful hybrid quantum mechanics-molecular mechanics methods (QM/MM). The key issue for such ML/MM methods is an adequate description of the coupling between the region of the system described by ML and the region described at the MM level. In the context of QM/MM schemes, the main ingredient of the interaction is electrostatic, and the state of the art is the so-called electrostatic-embedding. In this study, we analyze the quality of simpler mechanical embedding-based approaches, specifically focusing on their application within a ML/MM framework utilizing atomic partial charges derived in vacuo. Taking as reference electrostatic embedding calculations performed at a QM(DFT)/MM level, we explore different atomic charges schemes, as well as a polarization correction computed using atomic polarizabilites. Our benchmark data set comprises a set of about 80k small organic structures from the ANI-1x and ANI-2x databases, solvated in water. The results suggest that the minimal basis iterative stockholder (MBIS) atomic charges yield the best agreement with the reference coupling energy. Remarkable enhancements are achieved by including a simple polarization correction.

AB The value and welfare of performance horses is closely tied to locomotor behaviors, but we lack objective and quantitative measures for these characteristics, and qualitative approaches for assessing gait do not provide measures suitable for large-scale biomechanical research studies. Digital video analysis utilizing artificial intelligence-based strategies holds promise to meet the need for an economical, accurate, repeatable and objective technique for field quantification of equine locomotion. Here we describe pilot work using a consumerlevel digital video camera to capture high-resolution and high-speed videos of horses moving at the trot during mandatory inspections for international-level eventing competitions. We assessed 194 horses from five different competition venues, recorded at pre-competition (first) and post-cross-country (second) inspections as a model of gait change following exertion. We labeled twenty-six keypoints on each frame with DeepLabCut and processed the resulting tracking data using MatLab to derive quantitative gait parameters. Once trained, the DeepLabCut model labeled the 388 videos in just minutes, a task that would have otherwise taken months of human effort to complete. A Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) examining seven gait parameters identified significant changes in duty factor, speed, and forelimb swing range following the completion of the cross-country phase (P <= 0.05). Despite some limitations, video analysis through artificial intelligence proved capable of quantifying several gait parameters quickly, efficiently, and without the need for specialized equipment, making this tool a promising option for future biomechanical research in the athletic horse.

ID OBFUSCATION; HARDWARE; ATTACKS
AB Obfuscation or Logic locking (LL) is a technique for protecting hardware intellectual property (IP) blocks against diverse threats, including IP theft, reverse engineering, and malicious modifications. State-of-the-art locking techniques primarily focus on securing a design from unauthorized usage by disabling correct functionality - they often do not directly address hiding design intent through structural transformations. They rely on the synthesis tool to introduce structural changes. We observe that this process is insufficient as the resulting changes in circuit topology are: (1) local and (2) predictable. In this paper, we analyze the structural transformations introduced by LL and introduce a potential attack, called SAIL, that can exploit structural artifacts introduced by LL. SAIL uses machine learning (ML) guided structural recovery that exposes a critical vulnerability in these techniques. Through this attack, we demonstrate that the gate-level structure of a locked design can be retrieved in most parts through a systematic set of steps. The proposed attack is applicable to most forms of logic locking, and significantly more powerful than existing attacks, e.g., SAT-based attacks, since it does not require the availability of golden functional responses (e.g., an unlocked IC). Evaluation on benchmark circuits shows that we can recover an average of about 92%, up to 97%, transformations (Top-10 R-Metric) introduced by logic locking. We show that this attack is scalable, flexible, and versatile. Additionally, to evaluate the SAIL attack resilience of a locked design, we present the SIVA-Metric that is fast in terms of computation speed and does not require any training. We also propose possible mitigation steps for incorporating SAIL resilience into a locked design.

AB Purpose of reviewThe current tools to proactively guide and individualize immunosuppression in solid organ transplantation are limited. Despite continued improvements in posttransplant outcomes, the adverse effects of over-immunosuppression or under-immunosuppression are common. The present review is intended to highlight recent advances in individualized immunosuppression.Recent findingsThere has been a great focus on genomic information to predict drug dose requirements, specifically on single nucleotide polymorphisms of CYP3A5 and ABCB1. Furthermore, biomarker studies have developed ways to better predict clinical outcomes, such as graft rejection.SummaryThe integration of advanced computing tools, such as artificial neural networks and machine learning, with genome sequencing has led to intriguing findings on individual or group-specific dosing requirements. Rapid computing allows for processing of data and discovering otherwise undetected clinical patterns. Genetic polymorphisms of CYP3A5 and ABCB1 have yielded results to suggest varying dose requirements correlated with race and sex. Newly proposed biomarkers offer precise and noninvasive ways to monitor patient's status. Cell-free DNA quantitation is increasingly explored as an indicator of allograft injury and rejection, which can help avoid unneeded biopsies and more frequently monitor graft function.

AB There is a need to develop improved methods for water quality analysis. Traditionally, water quality analysis is performed in a laboratory on discrete samples or in the field with simple sensors, but these methods have inherent limitations. Ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy (UVAS) is a commonly used laboratory technique for water quality analysis and is being applied more broadly in combination with machine learning (ML) to allow for the detection of multiple analytes without sample pretreatments. This methodology (referred to here as Hydrochemical analysis using Ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy and Machine learning; 'HUM') can be applied in the laboratory or in situ while requiring less time, labor, and materials compared to traditional laboratory analysis. HUM has been used for the quantification of a variety of chemicals in a variety of settings, but information is lacking related to instrumental setup, sample requirements, and data analysis procedures. For instance, there is a need to investigate the influence of spectral parameters (e.g., sensitivity, signal-to-noise ratio, and spectral resolution) on measurement error. There is also a lack of research aimed at developing ML algorithms specifically for HUM. Finally, there are emerging concepts such as sensor fusion and model-sensor fusion which have been applied to similar fields but are not common in studies involving HUM. This review suggests the need for further studies to better understand the factors that influence HUM measurement accuracy along with the need for hardware and software developments so that the methodology can ultimately become more robust and standardized. This, in turn, could increase its adoption in both academic and non-academic settings. Once the HUM methodology has matured, it could help to reduce the environmental impacts of society by improving our understanding and management of environmental systems through high-frequency data collection and automated control of water quality in environmentally relevant systems.

DT Article

AB PURPOSE We focus on the problem of scarcity of annotated training data for nucleus recognition in Ki-67 immunohistochemistry (IHC)-stained pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET) images. We hypothesize that deep learning-based domain adaptation is helpful for nucleus recognition when image annotations are unavailable in target data sets.
   METHODS We considered 2 different institutional pancreatic NET data sets: one (ie, source) containing 38 cases with 114 annotated images and the other (ie, target) containing 72 cases with 20 annotated images. The gold standards were manually annotated by 1 pathologist. We developed a novel deep learning-based domain adaptation framework to count different types of nuclei (ie, immunopositive tumor, immunonegative tumor, nontumor nuclei). We compared the proposed method with several recent fully supervised deep learning models, such as fully convolutional network-8s (FCN-8s), U-Net, fully convolutional regression network (FCRN) A, FCRNB, and fully residual convolutional network (FRCN). We also evaluated the proposed method by learning with a mixture of converted source images and real target annotations.
   RESULTS Our method achieved an F1 score of 81.3% and 62.3% for nucleus detection and classification in the target data set, respectively. Our method outperformed FCN-8s (53.6% and 43.6% for nucleus detection and classification, respectively), U-Net (61.1% and 47.6%), FCRNA (63.4% and 55.8%), and FCRNB (68.2% and 60.6%) in terms of F1 score and was competitive with FRCN (81.7% and 70.7%). In addition, learning with a mixture of converted source images and only a small set of real target labels could further boost the performance.
   CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that deep learning-based domain adaptation is helpful for nucleus recognition in Ki-67 IHC stained images when target data annotations are not available. It would improve the applicability of deep learning models designed for downstream supervised learning tasks on different data sets. (C) 2020 by American Society of Clinical Oncology

AB Pattern mining is an essential part of knowledge discovery and data analytics. It is a powerful paradigm, especially when combined with constraint reasoning. In this overview, we showcase Seq2Pat, a constraint-based sequential pattern mining (SPM) tool with a high-level declarative user interface. The library finds frequent patterns in large sequence databases subject to constraints. We highlight key benefits especially desirable in industrial settings where scalability, explainability, rapid experimentation, reusability, and reproducibility are of great practical interest. We then bridge SPM with supervised machine learning via dichotomic pattern mining (DPM). DPM exploits the dichotomy between outcomes correlated with patterns that uniquely distinguish them. Last, we present an automated feature extraction powered by Seq2Pat and DPM to discover high-level insights and boost downstream machine learning models for intent prediction in digital behavior analysis.

AB Equipment costs play a critical role in decision making during design and construction, which requires up-to-date information and data. The design of this study incorporates the inputs from the literature review on the influencing factors of equipment costs and major targeted equipment types to enhance decision support for equipment selection, project construction, and maintenance issues. Two traditional cost estimation methods and five machine-learning methods were compared in this study to identify significant attributes related to the predictions of the costs and residual values of each targeted equipment type. The novelty of this study is that the developed method improves prediction accuracy by establishing a comprehensive and well-structured database framework. A comparison of this method with the existing prediction models reveals that the results and the accuracy of multiple regression analysis are improved in the range of (3% to 33.97%) with the use of a modified decision-tree model combined with support vector machines. The major contribution of this research is the design, implementation, and validation of a machine-learning-based modified decision tree with a support vector machine model for improved accuracy and decision support in construction management. Future research should consider the relationship between geographical variations and value changes.

AB Existing polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (Pol-SAR) image classification methods cannot achieve satisfactory performance on complex scenes characterized by several types of land cover with significant levels of noise or similar scattering properties across land cover types. Hence, we propose a supervised classification method aimed at constructing a classifier based on self-paced learning (SPL). SPL has been demonstrated to be effective at dealing with complex data while providing classifier performance improvement. In this paper, a novel support vector machine (SVM) algorithm based on SPL with neighborhood constraints (SVM_SPLNC) is proposed. The proposed method leverages the easiest samples first to obtain an initial parameter vector. Then, more complex samples are gradually incorporated to update the parameter vector iteratively. Moreover, neighborhood constraints are introduced during the training process to further improve performance. Experimental results on three real PolSAR images show that the proposed method performs well on complex scenes.

AB This study aims to identify effective predictors that influence publics' emotional reactions to COVID-19 vaccine misinformation as well as corrective messages. We collected a large sample of COVID-19 vaccine related misinformation and corrective messages on Facebook as well as the users' emotional reactions (i.e., emojis) to these messages. Focusing on three clusters of features such as messages' linguistic features, source characteristics, and messages' network positions, we examined whether users' reactions to misinformation and corrective information would differ. We used random forest models to identify the most salient predictors among over 70 predictors for both types of messages. Our analysis found that for misinformation, political ideology of the message source was the most salient feature that predicted anxious and enthusiastic reactions, followed by message features that highlight personal concerns and messages' network positions. For corrective messages, while the sources' ideology was still key to raising anxiety, the most important feature for triggering enthusiasm was the messages' network positions and message quality.

AB Wheat is the most important staple crop grown in Australia, and Australia is one of the top wheat exporting countries globally. Timely and reliable wheat yield prediction in Australia is important for regional and global food security. Prior studies use either climate data, or satellite data, or a combination of these two to build empirical models to predict crop yield. However, though the performance of yield prediction using empirical methods is improved by combining the use of climate and satellite data, the contributions from different data sources are still not clear. In addition, how the regression-based methods compare with various machine learning based methods in their performance in yield prediction is also not well understood and needs in-depth investigation. This work integrated various sources of data to predict wheat yield across Australia from 2000 to 2014 at the statistical division (SD) level. We adopted a well-known regression method (LASSO, as a benchmark) and three mainstream machine learning methods (support vector machine, random forest, and neural network) to build various empirical models for yield prediction. For satellite data, we used the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) from MODIS and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from GOME-2 and SCIAMACHY as metrics to approximate crop productivity. The machine-learning based methods outperform the regression method in modeling crop yield. Our results confirm that combining climate and satellite data can achieve high performance of yield prediction at the SD level (R-2 similar to 0.75). The satellite data track crop growth condition and gradually capture the variability of yield evolving with the growing season, and their contributions to yield prediction usually saturate at the peak of the growing season. Climate data provide extra and unique information beyond what the satellite data have offered for yield prediction, and our empirical modeling work shows the added values of climate variables exist across the whole season, not only at some certain stages. We also find that using EVI as an input can achieve better performance in yield prediction than SIF, primarily due to the large noise in the satellite-based SIF data (i.e. coarse resolution in both space and time). In addition, we also explored the potential for timely wheat yield prediction in Australia, and we can achieve the optimal prediction performance with approximately two-month lead time before wheat maturity. The proposed methodology in this paper can be extended to different crops and different regions for crop yield prediction.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely adopted in higher education. However, the current research on AI in higher education is limited lacking both breadth and depth. The present study fills the research gap by exploring faculty members' perception on teaching AI and data science related courses facilitated by an open experiential AI platform. Specifically, two focus groups are conducted among computer science and non-computer science faculty members to gauge their perception on the integration of AI in an experiential learning platform to teach data science, as well as their perception on AI powered data science curriculum in higher education. Findings reveal three major themes which are defining data science, assembling interdisciplinary teams, and building platform for connection. The study has both theoretical and practical implications.

AB PurposeWith the trend of adopting and studying artificial intelligence (AI) service robots at restaurants, the authors' understanding of how customers perceive robots differently across restaurant segments remains limited. Therefore, building upon expectancy theory, this study aims to propose a trust-based mechanism to explain customers' support for AI-based service robots. Design/methodology/approachFor cross-segment validation, data were collected from online survey participants under the scenarios of experiencing AI service robots in luxury (n = 428), fine-dining (n = 420), casual (n = 409) and quick-service (n = 410) restaurant scenarios. FindingsIn all four segments, trust in technology increased willingness to accept AI service robots, which was then positively related to customers' support for AI-based service robots. Meanwhile, customers' AI performance expectancy mediated the relationship between trust in technology and willingness to accept AI service robots. On the other hand, at luxury, fine-dining and casual restaurants, males perceived a stronger positive relationship between trust in technology and AI performance expectancy. No generational differences were found in the four restaurant segments between trust in technology and AI performance expectancy. Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is one of the first attempts in hospitality research to examine cross-segment validation of customers' responses to AI-based service robots in the luxury, fine-dining, casual and quick-service restaurant segments.

ID PRODUCT QUANTIZATION
AB Passage retrieval has been studied for decades, and many recent approaches of passage retrieval are using dense embeddings generated from deep neural models, called "dense passage retrieval". The state-of-the-art end-to-end dense passage retrieval systems normally deploy a deep neural model followed by an approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search module. The model generates embeddings of the corpus and queries, which are then indexed and searched by the high-performance ANN module. With the increasing data scale, the ANN module unavoidably becomes the bottleneck on efficiency. An alternative is the learned index, which achieves significantly high search efficiency by learning the data distribution and predicting the target data location. But most of the existing learned indexes are designed for low dimensional data, which are not suitable for dense passage retrieval with high-dimensional dense embeddings.
   In this paper, we propose LIDER, an efficient high-dimensional Learned Index for large-scale DEnse passage Retrieval. LIDER has a clustering-based hierarchical architecture formed by two layers of core models. As the basic unit of LIDER to index and search data, a core model includes an adapted recursive model index (RMI) and a dimension reduction component which consists of an extended SortingKeys-LSH (SK-LSH) and a key re-scaling module. The dimension reduction component reduces the high-dimensional dense embeddings into one-dimensional keys and sorts them in a specific order, which are then used by the RMI to make fast prediction. Experiments show that LIDER has a higher search speed with high retrieval quality comparing to the state-of-the-art ANN indexes on passage retrieval tasks, e.g., on large-scale data it achieves 1.2x search speed and significantly higher retrieval quality than the fastest baseline in our evaluation. Furthermore, LIDER has a better capability of speed-quality trade-off.

AB The exponential growth of ridesourcing services has been disrupting the transportation sector and changing how people travel. As ridesourcing continues to grow in popularity, being able to accurately predict the demand for it is essential for effective land-use and transportation planning and policymaking. Using recently released trip-level ridesourcing data in Chicago along with a range of variables obtained from publicly available data sources, we applied random forest, a widely-applied machine learning technique, to estimate a zone-to-zone (census tract) direct demand model for ridesourcing services. Compared to the traditional multiplicative models, the random forest model had a better model fit and achieved much higher predictive accuracy. We found that socioeconomic and demographic variables collectively contributed the most (about 50%) to the predictive power of the random forest model. Travel impedance, the built-environment characteristics, and the transit-supply-related variables are also indispensable in ridesourcing demand prediction.

AB Background: Inpatient falls, many resulting in injury or death, are a serious problem in hospital settings. Existing falls risk assessment tools, such as the Morse Fall Scale, give a risk score based on a set of factors, but don't necessarily signal which factors are most important for predicting falls. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods provide an opportunity to improve predictive performance while also identifying the most important risk factors associated with hospital-acquired falls. We can glean insight into these risk factors by applying classification tree, bagging, random forest, and adaptive boosting methods applied to Electronic Health Record (EHR) data.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to use tree-based machine learning methods to determine the most important predictors of inpatient falls, while also validating each via cross-validation.
   Materials and methods: A case-control study was designed using EHR and electronic administrative data collected between January 1, 2013 to October 31, 2013 in 14 medical surgical units. The data contained 38 predictor variables which comprised of patient characteristics, admission information, assessment information, clinical data, and organizational characteristics. Classification tree, bagging, random forest, and adaptive boosting methods were used to identify the most important factors of inpatient fall-risk through variable importance measures. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve were computed via ten-fold cross validation and compared via pairwise t-tests. These methods were also compared to a univariate logistic regression of the Morse Fall Scale total score.
   Results: In terms of AUROC, bagging (0.89), random forest (0.90), and boosting (0.89) all outperformed the Morse Fall Scale (0.86) and the classification tree (0.85), but no differences were measured between bagging, random forest, and adaptive boosting, at a p-value of 0.05. History of Falls, Age, Morse Fall Scale total score, quality of gait, unit type, mental status, and number of high fall risk increasing drugs (FRIDs) were considered the most important features for predicting inpatient fall risk.
   Conclusions: Machine learning methods have the potential to identify the most relevant and novel factors for the detection of hospitalized patients at risk of falling, which would improve the quality of patient care, and to more fully support healthcare provider and organizational leadership decision-making. Nurses would be able to enhance their judgement to caring for patients at risk for falls. Our study may also serve as a reference for the development of AI-based prediction models of other iatrogenic conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the importance of patient, clinical, and organizational features based on the use of AI approaches.

AB A linear regression-based machine learned interatomic potential (MLIP) was developed for the silicon-carbon system. The MLIP was predominantly trained on structures discovered through a genetic algorithm, encompassing the entire silicon-carbon composition space, and uses as its foundation the Ultra-Fast Force Fields (UF3) formulation. To improve MLIP performance, the learning algorithm was modified to include higher spline interpolation resolution in regions with large potential energy surface curvature. The developed MLIP demonstrates exceptional predictive performance, accurately estimating energies and forces for structures across the silicon-carbon composition and configuration space. The MLIP predicts structural, energetic, and elastic properties of silicon carbide (SiC) with high precision and captures fundamental volume-pressure and volume-temperature relationships. Uniquely, this silicon-carbon MLIP is adept at modeling complex high-temperature phenomena, including the peritectic decomposition of SiC and carbon dimer formation during SiC surface reconstruction, which cannot be captured with prior classical interatomic potentials for this material.

ID SYSTEM
AB Hashing has become a popular tool on histopathology image analysis due to the significant gain in both computation and storage. However, most of current hashing techniques learn features and binary codes individually from whole images, or emphasize the inter-class difference but neglect the relevance order within the same classes. To alleviate these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel pairwise based deep ranking hashing framework. We first define a pairwise matrix to preserve intra-class relevance and inter-class difference. Then we propose an objective function that utilizes two identical continuous matrices generated by the hyperbolic tangent (tanh) function to approximate the pairwise matrix. Finally, we incorporate the objective function into a deep learning architecture to learn features and binary codes simultaneously. The proposed framework is validated on 5356 skeletal muscle and 2176 lung cancer images with four types of diseases, and it can achieve 97.49% classification accuracy, 97.49% mean average precision (MAP) with 100 returned images, and 0.51 NDCG score with 50 retrieved neighbors on 2032 query images.

AB This study seeks to use machine learning to investigate the role of meteorological and climate variables on wildfire occurrence in the Arctic and the global tropical forests biomes. Using monthly fire counts observed by the MODIS satellites in combination with temperature and precipitation data, indices of large-scale atmospheric and oceanic anomalies (teleconnections), and global temperature anomalies (GT), a combined wavelet-machine learning approach is developed to identify drivers of variability in global wildfire counts on a monthly scale. Precipitation and temperature are found to be the most important predictors of wildfire count in all regions. In addition, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and GT are identified as the two major drivers of wildfire occurrence. Results indicate that the record-breaking 2019 wildfires in the Asian Arctic can be attributed to unusually warm and dry weather, while the recent increase in wildfires in Amazonia rather can be attributed to regional human activities.

AB Predicting liquid metal embrittlement (LME) between arbitrary liquid-solid metal pairs is particularly challenging; conflicting reports in the literature have prevented the creation of generalized predictive models. Recent advances have shifted the LME paradigm from binary-embrittlement either occurs or does not occur-to multiple, potentially cooperative mechanisms. In this work, a dataset comprising the vast majority of LME experiments reported in the literature was created for training machine learning (ML) models to predict LME under the new paradigm. Several ML classification techniques, including k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and decision tree classifiers, were trained to predict the occurrence and mechanism of LME for a given liquid-solid pair. Specifically, a KNN 1-vs-1 classifier was > 80% accurate in predicting LME, surpassing any prior models in the literature. Additionally, the decision tree models shed light on the features most important for predicting LME and identifying the mechanisms.

AB Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have become a popular tool for worldwide learners. However, a lack of emotional interaction and support is an important reason for learners to abandon their learning and eventually results in poor learning performance. This study applied an integrative framework of achievement emotions to uncover their holistic influence on students' learning by analyzing more than 400,000 forum posts from 13 MOOCs. Six machine-learning models were first built to automatically identify achievement emotions, including K-Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines. Results showed that Random Forest performed the best with a kappa of 0.83 and an ROC_AUC of 0.97. Then, multilevel modeling with the "Stepwise Build-up" strategy was used to quantify the effect of achievement emotions on students' academic performance. Results showed that different achievement emotions influenced students' learning differently. These findings allow MOOC platforms and instructors to provide relevant emotional feedback to students automatically or manually, thereby improving their learning in MOOCs.

AB Effective assisted living environments must be able to infer how their occupants interact in a variety of scenarios. Gaze direction provides strong indications of how a person engages with the environment and its occupants. In this paper, we investigate the problem of gaze tracking in multi-camera assisted living environments. We propose a gaze tracking method based on predictions generated by a neural network regressor that relies only on the relative positions of facial keypoints to estimate gaze. For each gaze prediction, our regressor also provides an estimate of its own uncertainty, which is used to weigh the contribution of previously estimated gazes within a tracking framework based on an angular Kalman filter. Our gaze estimation neural network uses confidence gated units to alleviate keypoint prediction uncertainties in scenarios involving partial occlusions or unfavorable views of the subjects. We evaluate our method using videos from the MoDiPro dataset, which we acquired in a real assisted living facility, and on the publicly available MPIIFaceGaze, GazeFollow, and Gaze360 datasets. Experimental results show that our gaze estimation network outperforms sophisticated state-of-the-art methods, while additionally providing uncertainty predictions that are highly correlated with the actual angular error of the corresponding estimates. Finally, an analysis of the temporal integration performance of our method demonstrates that it generates accurate and temporally stable gaze predictions.

AB Objective: This study investigated the degrees of lenition, or consonantal weakening, in the production of Spanish stop consonants by native English speakers during a study abroad (SA) program. Lenition is a key phonological process in Spanish, where voiced stops (/b/, /d/, /g/) typically weaken to fricatives or approximants in specific phonetic environments. For L2 learners, mastering this subtle process is essential for achieving native-like pronunciation. Methods: To assess the learners' progress in acquiring lenition, we employed Phonet, a deep learning model. Unlike traditional quantitative acoustic methods that focus on measuring the physical properties of speech sounds, Phonet utilizes recurrent neural networks to predict the posterior probabilities of phonological features, particularly sonorant and continuant characteristics, which are central to the lenition process. Results: The results indicated that while learners showed progress in producing the fricative-like variants of lenition during the SA program and understood how to produce lenition in appropriate contexts, the retention of these phonological gains was not sustained after their return. Additionally, unlike native speakers, the learners never fully achieved the approximant-like realization of lenition. Conclusions: These findings underscore the need for sustained exposure and practice beyond the SA experience to ensure the long-term retention of L2 phonological patterns. While SA programs offer valuable opportunities for enhancing L2 pronunciation, they should be supplemented with ongoing support to consolidate and extend the gains achieved during the immersive experience.

AB Humanitarian supply chains (HSCs) play a crucial role in mitigating the impacts of natural disasters and preventing humanitarian crises. Designing resilient HSCs is critically important to ensure effective recovery and long-term sustainability during and after such events. This study addresses the design of resilient HSCs with viability consideration under known-unknown demand and capacity uncertainties by formulating a two-stage stochastic programming model. To solve this problem and achieve high-quality solutions, three solution approaches are developed and compared. The first approach introduces risk aversion into a genetic algorithm (GA) through chance constraints, termed GA with chance constraints (GAC). The other two approaches integrate the Random Forest (RF) algorithm with GAC, employing incremental learning (GACRFI) and non-incremental learning (GACRFNI). To evaluate the performance of these algorithms and provide insights into designing a resilient HSC, a full factorial design of experiments (DoE) is established using controllable factors. Problems are generated for three cases, each of which corresponds to a distinct disruption and ripple effect severity degree. Computational analysis shows that integrating the machine learning algorithm into the GA yields superior results across all risk level settings, leading to a win-win situation for all stakeholders in HSCs. This study provides valuable insights for designing resilient HSCs that ensure both short-term recovery and long-term sustainability by considering viability under varying risk levels and severity degrees.

ID EXTRACTION
AB Extra-label drug use in food animal medicine is authorized by the US Animal Medicinal Drug Use Clarification Act (AMDUCA), and estimated withdrawal intervals are based on published scientific pharmacokinetic data. Occasionally there is a paucity of scientific data on which to base a withdrawal interval or a large number of animals being treated, driving the need to test for drug residues. Rapid assay commercial farm-side tests are essential for monitoring drug residues in animal products to protect human health. Active ingredients, sensitivity, matrices, and species that have been evaluated for commercial rapid assay tests are typically reported on manufacturers' websites or in PDF documents that are available to consumers but may require a special access request. Additionally, this information is not always correlated with FDA-approved tolerances. Furthermore, parameter changes for these tests can be very challenging to regularly identify, especially those listed on websites or in documents that are not publicly available. Therefore, artificial intelligence plays a critical role in efficiently extracting the data and ensure current information. Extracting tables from PDF and HTML documents has been investigated both by academia and commercial tool builders. Research in text mining of such documents has become a widespread yet challenging arena in implementing natural language programming. However, techniques of extracting tables are still in their infancy and being investigated and improved by researchers. In this study, we developed and evaluated a data-mining method for automatically extracting rapid assay data from electronic documents. Our automatic electronic data extraction method includes a software package module, a developed pattern recognition tool, and a data mining engine. Assay details were provided by several commercial entities that produce these rapid drug residue assay tests. During this study, we developed a real-time conversion system and method for reflowing contents in these files for accessibility practice and research data mining. Embedded information was extracted using an AI technology for text extraction and text mining to convert to structured formats. These data were then made available to veterinarians and producers via an online interface, allowing interactive searching and also presenting the commercial test assay parameters in reference to FDA-approved tolerances.

ID REINFORCEMENT
AB During sensory preconditioning, rats were given two distinct flavors (saccharin and coffee) in sequence with 0, 9, or 27 sec between the two flavors.  A control group received the flavors unpaired.  In subsequent training, the second flavor preceded sucrose by 5 min.  Later, the subjects that had had 0- or 9-sec delays between the two flavors showed a significant preference for the flavor not directly reinforced, whereas those that had had a 27-sec delay showed only a marginally significant preference.  Although taste aversions have been produced using these methods, this is the first demonstration of conditioned preferences for flavors not directly associated with the reinforcers.  These results offer an alternative way to study flavor-flavor learning.

AB Goal: This work aims at developing a novel calibration-free fast parallel MRI (pMRI) reconstruction method incorporate with discrete-time optimal control framework. The reconstruction model is designed to learn a regularization that combines channels and extracts features by leveraging the information sharing among channels of multi-coil images. We propose to recover both magnitude and phase information by taking advantage of structured convolutional networks in image and Fourier spaces.Methods: We develop a novel variational model with a learnable objective function that integrates an adaptive multi-coil image combination operator and effective image regularization in the image and Fourier spaces. We cast the reconstruction network as a structured discrete-time optimal control system, resulting in an optimal control formulation of parameter training where the parameters of the objective function play the role of control variables. We demonstrate that the Lagrangian method for solving the control problem is equivalent to back propagation, ensuring the local convergence of the training algorithm.Results: We conduct a large number of numerical experiments of the proposed method with comparisons to several state-of-the-art pMRI reconstruction networks on real pMRI datasets. The numerical results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed method evidently.Conclusion: The proposed method provides a general deep network design and training framework for efficient joint-channel pMRI reconstruction.Significance: By learning multi-coil image combination operator and performing regularizations in both image domain and k-space domain, the proposed method achieves a highly efficient image reconstruction network for pMRI.

AB Key PointsLack of human kidney tissue availability and access has hindered molecular understanding of human diabetic kidney disease processes and disease heterogeneity.Preclinical validation of diabetic kidney disease targets using data from large, human kidney samples should reduce poor translatability to clinical trials.The Network for Pancreatic Organ donors with Diabetes-Kidney cohort is validated and available for use by the research community.BackgroundThe Network for Pancreatic Organ Donors with Diabetes-Kidney (nPOD-K) project was initiated to assess the feasibility of using kidneys from organ donors to enhance understanding of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) progression.MethodsTraditional and digital pathology approaches were used to characterize the nPOD-K cohort. Periodic acid-Schiff- and hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections were used to manually examine and score each nPOD-K case. Brightfield and fluorescently labeled whole slide images of nPOD-K sections were used to train, validate, and test deep learning compartment segmentation and machine learning image analysis tools within Visiopharm software. These digital pathology tools were subsequently used to evaluate kidney cell-specific markers and pathological indicators.ResultsDigital quantitation of mesangial expansion, tubular atrophy, kidney injury molecule-1 expression, cellular infiltration, and fibrosis index aligned with histological DKD classification, as defined by pathologists' review. Histological quantification confirmed loss of podocyte, endothelial, and tubular markers, correlating with DKD progression. Altered expression patterns of prominin-1, protein-tyrosine phosphatase receptor type O, and coronin 2B were validated, in agreement with reported literature.ConclusionsThe nPOD-K cohort provides a unique open resource opportunity to not only validate putative drug targets, but also better understand DKD pathophysiology. A broad range of pathogenesis can be visualized in each case, providing a simulated timeline of DKD progression. We conclude that organ donor-derived tissues serve as high-quality samples, provide a comprehensive view of tissue pathology, and address the need for human kidney tissues available for research.

TI Integrating Inverse Photogrammetry and a Deep Learning-Based Point Cloud

AB Automatically converting three-dimensional (3D) point clouds into building information modeling (BIM) has been an active research area over the past few years. However, existing solutions in the literature have been suffering the limitations of covering all different design scenarios (prior knowledge-based approach) or collecting sufficient point clouds as training data sets (3D deep learning-based approach). To tackle this issue, we propose a fused system to automatically develop as-built BIMs from photogrammetric point clouds. A series of images is captured to generate a high-quality point cloud, which is then preprocessed by removing noise and downsizing points. Meanwhile, a two-dimensional (2D) deep-learning method, DeepLab, is utilized to semantically segment elements (e.g., walls, slabs, and columns) from the collected images. Subsequently, an inverse photogrammetric pipeline is employed to recognize element categories in the point cloud by projecting the isolated 3D planes into 2D images and assigning the identified elements to the 3D planes. Finally, the industry foundation classes are devised to create as-built BIMs based on the segmented point clouds. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed system, we selected six cases with various elements as the testbed. The prospective results reveal that (1) our system can provide a highly automated solution to develop as-built BIMs; and (2) 39 out of 45 elements in six different cases are successfully recognized in point clouds.

AB Neural network-based approaches have emerged as alternatives to conventional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in solving multiphase flow problems. However, most of these approaches are based on data-driven machine learning methods that require training datasets prepared beforehand through CFD simulations or experiments and cannot be used independently. This study presents an unsupervised parameterized physics-informed neural networks (P-PINNs) approach for obtaining the full flow field information over a multi-dimensional parametric space. This approach is then applied to solve the three-dimensional flow around an arbitrarily rotating sphere subjected to a cross-flow. This solution is obtained for a continuous range of three parameters: the Reynolds number based on cross-flow ( Re is an element of [1,400]), , 400] ), non-dimensional streamwise and spanwise angular velocity components (Omega(x & lowast;), Omega(y & lowast;) , is an element of [-3, , 3] ). The predictions from the P-PINNs model are compared against particle-resolved direct numerical simulation (PR-DNS) results, demonstrating that the neural network model predicts all flow variables (velocity, pressure, and their spatial derivatives) accurately with R-2 greater than or similar to 0.9. The force and torque on the particle obtained from the P-PINNs model are also compared well against the corresponding PR-DNS results with R-2 > 0.94. . 94. The key observation is that the computational cost of the unsupervised parameterized neural network model training and deployment is substantially lower than performing numerous conventional CFD simulations to systematically vary the parameters. Furthermore, once trained, the resultant neural network model is substantially more compact than the huge database of discretized numerical solutions. The P-PINNs model is then used to reveal several interesting flow features and phenomena about the rotating sphere, including flow symmetry, secondary drag and lift, critical Reynolds number, flow bifurcation, and flow separation. This study presents P-PINNs as an efficient alternative for solving parameterized flow problems, demonstrating its practical usage in flow physics discovery with the example of flow past an arbitrarily rotating sphere.

AB Ozone is one of the most important greenhouse gases and air pollutants in urban areas, and has significantly negative impacts both on the climate change and human health. In addition to alert the public for health concerns, accurate ozone prediction is also crucial to understand the formation mechanisms of surface ozone episodes, and has significant implications for making emission control strategies of ozone precursors such as methane, carbon monoxide, and volatile organic compounds. However, existing methods of ozone concentration prediction could not effectively capture temporal dependency, and most neglect spatial correlations. In this study, a hybrid sequence to sequence model embedded with the attention mechanism is proposed for predicting regional ground-level ozone concentration. In the proposed model, the inherent spatiotemporal correlations in air quality monitoring network are simultaneously extracted, learned and incorporated, and auxiliary air pollution and meteorological information are adaptively involved. The hourly data collected from 35 air quality monitoring stations and 651 meteorological girds in Beijing, China are used to validate the present model. The results demonstrate that the spatiotemporal correlations in the monitoring network present enormous advantages for the regional ozone prediction. Auxiliary data and time lags matching day-of-week or diurnal periods of ozone are confirmed to benefit the improvement of prediction accuracy. Monitoring stations in urban areas exhibit better prediction performances than stations in remote areas. The addressed model outperforms the baseline models, and is proven to have excellent performance in all monitoring station categories of Beijing and different months with significant disparity of ozone concentrations.

AB Kidney pathophysiology is often complex, nonlinear and heterogeneous, which limits the utility of hypothetical-deductive reasoning and linear, statistical approaches to diagnosis and treatment. Emerging evidence suggests that artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled decision support systems - which use algorithms based on learned examples - may have an important role in nephrology. Contemporary AI applications can accurately predict the onset of acute kidney injury before notable biochemical changes occur; can identify modifiable risk factors for chronic kidney disease onset and progression; can match or exceed human accuracy in recognizing renal tumours on imaging studies; and may augment prognostication and decision-making following renal transplantation. Future AI applications have the potential to make real-time, continuous recommendations for discrete actions and yield the greatest probability of achieving optimal kidney health outcomes. Realizing the clinical integration of AI applications will require cooperative, multidisciplinary commitment to ensure algorithm fairness, overcome barriers to clinical implementation, and build an AI-competent workforce. AI-enabled decision support should preserve the pre-eminence of wisdom and augment rather than replace human decision-making. By anchoring intuition with objective predictions and classifications, this approach should favour clinician intuition when it is honed by experience.
   Emerging evidence suggests that artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled decision support systems may have an important role in the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of kidney diseases. This Review provides an overview of AI fundamentals and the state of the art of AI-enabled decision support systems in nephrology.

AB Efficient and robust cell detection serves as a critical prerequisite for many subsequent biomedical image analysis methods and computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). It remains a challenging task due to touching cells, inhomogeneous background noise, and large variations in cell sizes and shapes. In addition, the ever-increasing amount of available datasets and the high resolution of whole-slice scanned images pose a further demand for efficient processing algorithms. In this paper, we present a novel structured regression model based on a proposed fully residual convolutional neural network for efficient cell detection. For each testing image, our model learns to produce a dense proximity map that exhibits higher responses at locations near cell centers. Our method only requires a few training images with weak annotations (just one dot indicating the cell centroids). We have extensively evaluated our method using four different datasets, covering different microscopy staining methods (e.g., H & E or Ki-67 staining) or image acquisition techniques (e.g., bright-filed image or phase contrast). Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing state of the art methods in terms of both detection accuracy and running time. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to revolutionize family medicine, offering a transformative approach to achieving the Quintuple Aim. This article examines the imperative for family medicine to adapt to the rapidly evolving field of AI, with an emphasis on its integration in clinical practice. AI's recent advancements have the potential to significantly transform health care. We argue for the proactive engagement of family medicine in directing AI technologies toward enhancing the "Quintuple Aim." The article highlights potential benefits of AI, such as improved patient outcomes through enhanced diagnostic tools, clinician well-being through reduced administrative burdens, and the promotion of health equity by analyzing diverse data sets. However, we also acknowledge the risks associated with AI, including the potential for automation to diverge from patient-centered care and exacerbate health care disparities. Our recommendations stress the need for family medicine education to incorporate AI literacy, the development of a collaborative for AI integration, and the establishment of guidelines and standards through interdisciplinary cooperation. We conclude that although AI poses challenges, its responsible and ethical implementation can revolutionize family medicine, optimizing patient care and enhancing the role of clinicians in a technology-driven future.

AB Modeling spectral reflectance data using machine learning algorithms presents a promising approach for estimating soil attributes. Nevertheless, a comprehensive investigation of the most effective models, parameters, wavelengths, and data acquisition techniques is essential to ensure optimal predictive accuracy. This work aimed to (a) explore the potential of the soil spectral signature obtained in different spectral bands (VIS-NIR, SWIR, and VIS-NIR-SWIR) and, by using hyperspectral imaging and non-imaging sensors, in the predictive modeling of soil attributes; and (b) analyze the accuracy of different ML models in predicting particle size and soil organic carbon (SOC) applied to the spectral signature of different spectral bands. Six soil monoliths, located in the central north region of Parana, Brazil, were collected and scanned via hyperspectral cameras (VIS-NIR camera and SWIR camera) and spectroradiometer (VIS-NIR-SWIR) in the laboratory. The spectral signature of the soils was analyzed and subsequently applied to ML models to predict particle size and SOC. Each set of data obtained by the different sensors was evaluated separately. The algorithms used were k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), linear regression (LR), artificial neural network (NN), and partial least square regression (PLSR). The most promising predictive performance was observed for the complete VIS-NIR-SWIR spectrum, followed by SWIR and VIS-NIR. Meanwhile, KNN, RF, and NN models were the most promising algorithms in estimating soil attributes for the dataset obtained from both sensors. The general mean R2 (determination coefficient) values obtained using these models, considering the different spectral bands evaluated, were around 0.99, 0.98, and 0.97 for sand prediction, and around 0.99, 0.98, and 0.96 for clay prediction. The lower performances, obtained for the datasets from both sensors, were observed for silt and SOC, with R2 results between 0.40 and 0.59 for these models. KNN demonstrated the best predictive performance. Integrating effective ML models with robust sample databases, obtained by advanced hyperspectral imaging and spectroradiometers, can enhance the accuracy and efficiency of soil attribute prediction.

AB Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has become an important methodology in the analysis of the tumor microenvironment (TME) due to its ability to provide gene expression information with spatial resolution, enabling the identification and characterization of TME gene markers. Deep learning methods are proposed for analyzing spatial transcriptomic data for clustering the spatial regions of the TME based on gene expression. However, deep learning methods are often imposed by errors, which can impact the accuracy of gene expression quantification and TME gene identification. To address this issue, we propose a label-efficient method that utilizes curriculum learning and confidence learning to identify errors in graph deep learning when analyzing ST data. Our method explicitly incorporates the effect of noise in the learning process and employs probabilistic models or uncertainty estimates to represent the uncertainty in the data. Validated on human breast cancer ST data, we studied spatial gene expression in HER2-positive breast tumors using our method. The evaluation results suggest that the error quantification helps identify the noisy samples and subset the samples that results in more accurate gene expression quantification and TME gene identification. Additionally, there are biological insights obtained from the new subset formed by error samples. This error-robust deep learning method offers promising avenues for the analysis of spatial transcriptomic data, enabling accurate and label-efficient quantification of gene expression and identification of TME gene markers.

AB Given the nature of construction activities, construction workers usually work in a collaborative way. Thus, interpersonal influences among workers play a crucial role in forming and affecting construction workers' safety behaviors. The social learning literature indicates that interpersonal learning occurs in two opposing ways - positive reinforcement by demonstrating preferred behaviors, and negative reinforcement by demonstrating negative consequences of inappropriate behaviors. Amid theoretical disagreements in the social learning literature, it remains unclear in the construction safety literature how the two reinforced learning methods affect construction workers in safety training. To fill the gap, a human-subject experiment (n = 126) was conducted to investigate people's social learning behaviors in a hazardous construction situation - walking between two highrise buildings. The experiment utilizes a multi-user Virtual Reality (VR) system with a motion tracking feature. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: control group (no instruction was given), not-falling group (participants observed an avatar demonstrating appropriate walking behaviors), and falling group (participants watched an avatar quickly walking across a plank and falling off). Indicators, including walking time on the plank, walking speed, and gaze movement, were recorded and analyzed to quantify the effects of the two reinforced learning methods. The results indicate that demonstrating information with positive consequences (not-falling group) encourages people to follow the demonstration and maintain normal walking in a hazardous situation. Showing information with negative consequences (falling group) induced participants to walk faster and more irregularly, which further led to more mistakes and unsafe behaviors, This study demonstrates the effectiveness of using VR in safety studies and provides recommendations for better safety training programs.

AB Aims Canagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor indicated for lowering glucose, has been increasingly used in diabetes patients because of its beneficial effects on cardiovascular and renal outcomes. However, clinical trials have documented an increased risk of lower extremity amputations (LEA) associated with canagliflozin. We applied machine learning methods to predict LEA among diabetes patients treated with canagliflozin.
   Methods Using claims data from a 5% random sample of Medicare beneficiaries, we identified 13 904 diabetes individuals initiating canagliflozin between April 2013 and December 2016. The samples were randomly and equally split into training and testing sets. We identified 41 predictor candidates using information from the year prior to canagliflozin initiation, and applied four machine learning approaches (elastic net, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator [LASSO], gradient boosting machine and random forests) to predict LEA risk after canagliflozin initiation.
   Results The incidence rate of LEA was 0.57% over a median 1.5 years follow-up. LASSO produced the best prediction, yielding a C-statistic of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.76, 0.86). Among individuals categorized in the top 5% of the risk score, the actual incidence rate of LEA was 3.74%. Among the 16 factors selected by LASSO, history of LEA [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 33.6 (13.8, 81.9)] and loop diuretic use [aOR: 3.6 (1.8,7.3)] had the strongest associations with LEA incidence.
   Conclusions Our machine learning model efficiently predicted the risk of LEA among diabetes patients undergoing canagliflozin treatment. The risk score may support optimized treatment decisions and thus improve health outcomes of diabetes patients.

AB Citrus diseases are significant threats to citrus groves, causing financial losses through reduced fruit size, blemishes, premature fruit drop, and tree death. The detection of citrus diseases via leaf inspection can improve grove management and mitigation efforts. This study explores the potential of a portable reflectance and fluorescence hyperspectral imaging (HSI) system for detecting and classifying a control group and citrus leaf diseases, including canker, Huanglongbing (HLB), greasy spot, melanose, scab, and zinc deficiency. The HSI system was used to simultaneously collect reflectance and fluorescence images from the front and back sides of the leaves. Nine machine learning classifiers were trained using full spectra and spectral bands selected through principal component analysis (PCA) from the HSI with pixel-based and leaf-based spectra. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier achieved the highest overall classification accuracy of 90.7% when employing the full spectra of combined reflectance and fluorescence data and pixel-based analysis from the back side of the leaves, whereas a discriminant analysis classifier yielded the best accuracy of 94.5% with the full spectra of combined reflectance and fluorescence data and leaf-based analysis. Among the diseases, control, scab, and melanose were classified most accurately, each with over 90% accuracy. Therefore, the integration of the reflectance and fluorescence HSI with advanced machine learning techniques demonstrated the capability to accurately detect and classify these citrus leaf diseases with high precision.

AB IMPORTANCE Predicting postoperative complications has the potential to inform shared decisions regarding the appropriateness of surgical procedures, targeted risk-reduction strategies, and postoperative resource use. Realizing these advantages requires that accurate real-time predictions be integrated with clinical and digital workflows; artificial intelligence predictive analytic platforms using automated electronic health record (EHR) data inputs offer an intriguing possibility for achieving this, but there is a lack of high-level evidence from prospective studies supporting their use.
   OBJECTIVE To examine whether the MySurgeryRisk artificial intelligence system has stable predictive performance between development and prospective validation phases and whether it is feasible to provide automated outputs directly to surgeons' mobile devices.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this prognostic study, the platform used automated EHR data inputs and machine learning algorithms to predict postoperative complications and provide predictions to surgeons, previously through a web portal and currently through a mobile device application. All patients 18 years or older who were admitted for any type of inpatient surgical procedure (74417 total procedures involving 58 236 patients) between June 1, 2014, and September 20, 2020, were included. Models were developed using retrospective data from 52117 inpatient surgical procedures performed between June 1, 2014, and November 27, 2018. Validation was performed using data from 22 30 0 inpatient surgical procedures collected prospectively from November 28, 2018, to September 20, 2020.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Algorithms for generalized additive models and random forest models were developed and validated using real-time EHR data. Model predictive performance was evaluated primarily using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values.
   RESULTS Among 58 236 total adult patients who received 74417 major inpatient surgical procedures, the mean (SD) age was 57 (17) years; 29 226 patients (50.2%) were male. Results reported in this article focus primarily on the validation cohort. The validation cohort included 22 300 inpatient surgical procedures involving 19 132 patients (mean [SD] age, 58 [17] years; 9672 [50.6%] male). A total of 2765 patients (14.5%) were Black or African American, 14 777 (77.2%) were White, 1235 (6.5%) were of other races (including American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander, and multiracial), and 355 (1.9%) were of unknown race because of missing data; 979 patients (5.1%) were Hispanic, 17 663 (92.3%) were non-Hispanic, and 490 (2.6%) were of unknown ethnicity because of missing data. A greater number of input features was associated with stable or improved model performance. For example, the random forest model trained with 135 input features had the highest AUROC values for predicting acute kidney injury (0.82; 95% CI, 0.82-0.83); cardiovascular complications (0.81; 95% CI. 0.81-0.82); neurological complications, including delirium (0.87; 95% CI, 0.87-0.88); prolonged intensive care unit stay (0.89; 95% CI, 0.88-0.89); prolonged mechanical ventilation (0.91; 95% CI, 0.90-0.91); sepsis (0.86; 95% CI, 0.85-0.87); venous thromboembolism (0.82; 95% CI, 0.81-0.83); wound complications (0.78; 95% CI, 0.78-0.79); 30-day mortality (0.84; 95% CI, 0.82-0.86); and 90-day mortality (0.84; 95% CI, 0.82-0.85), with accuracy similar to surgeons' predictions. Compared with the original web portal, the mobile device application allowed efficient fingerprint login access and loaded data approximately 10 times faster. The application output displayed patient information, risk of postoperative complications, top 3 risk factors for each complication, and patterns of complications for individual surgeons compared with their colleagues.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study, automated real-time predictions of postoperative complications with mobile device outputs had good performance in clinical settings with prospective validation, matching surgeons' predictive accuracy.

AB Purpose: We examine the extent to which components of social learning theory (i.e., definitions, differential reinforcement, and differential association/modeling) predict stalking victimization and perpetration using survey data from a large sample of college students.
   Methods: Among a sample of 2,766 college students, logistic regression models were estimated to analyze the relationships between social learning theory and stalking perpetration and victimization.
   Results: Results suggest that victimization and perpetration are functions of social learning. The findings also indicated that females were significantly more likely to be both stalking victims and perpetrators.
   Conclusions: Regarding stalking perpetration and victimization, our results suggest that there may be responses, attitudes, and behaviors that are learned, modified, or reinforced primarily through interaction with peers. Overall, social learning theory concepts appear to be important predictors of stalking perpetration and victimization that help to develop theoretical explanations for stalking.

AB Analyzing soil in large and remote areas such as the Amazon River Basin (ARB) is unviable when it is entirely performed by wet labs using traditional methods due to the scarcity of labs and the significant workforce requirements, increasing costs, time, and waste. Remote sensing, combined with cloud computing, enhances soil analysis by modeling soil from spectral data and overcoming the limitations of traditional methods. We verified the potential of soil spectroscopy in conjunction with cloud-based computing to predict soil organic carbon (SOC) and particle size (sand, silt, and clay) content from the Amazon region. To this end, we request physicochemical attribute values determined by wet laboratory analyses of 211 soil samples from the ARB. These samples were submitted to spectroscopy Vis-NIR-SWIR in the laboratory. Two approaches modeled the soil attributes: M-I) cloud-computing-based using the Brazilian Soil Spectral Service (BraSpecS) platform, and M-II) computing-based in an offline environment using R programming language. Both methods used the Cubist machine learning algorithm for modeling. The coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) served as criteria for performance assessment. The soil attributes prediction was highly consistent, considering the measured and predicted by both approaches M-I and M-II. The M-II outperformed the M-I in predicting both particle size and SOC. For clay content, the offline model achieved an R2 of 0.85, with an MAE of 86.16 g kg-1 and RMSE of 111.73 g kg-1, while the online model had an R2 of 0.70, MAE of 111.73 g kg-1, and RMSE of 144.19 g kg-1. For SOC, the offline model also showed better performance, with an R2 of 0.81, MAE of 3.42 g kg-1, and RMSE of 4.57 g kg-1, compared to an R2 of 0.72, MAE of 3.66 g kg-1, and RMSE of 5.53 g kg-1 for the M-I. Both modeling methods demonstrated the power of reflectance spectroscopy and cloud computing to survey soils in remote and large areas such as ARB. The synergetic use of these techniques can support policies and sustainable development.

AB All-atom dynamics simulations are an indispensable quantitative tool in physics, chemistry, and materials science, but large systems and long simulation times remain challenging due to the trade-off between computational efficiency and predictive accuracy. To address this challenge, we combine effective two- and three-body potentials in a cubic B-spline basis with regularized linear regression to obtain machine-learning potentials that are physically interpretable, sufficiently accurate for applications, as fast as the fastest traditional empirical potentials, and two to four orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art machine-learning potentials. For data from empirical potentials, we demonstrate the exact retrieval of the potential. For data from density functional theory, the predicted energies, forces, and derived properties, including phonon spectra, elastic constants, and melting points, closely match those of the reference method. The introduced potentials might contribute towards accurate all-atom dynamics simulations of large atomistic systems over long-time scales.

AB The northern quahog Mercenaria mercenaria (also called hard clams) is one major bivalve species for aquaculture in the US. Accurate shell geometry quantification is essential for genetic breeding. Traditional manual measurements of dimensional traits and live weight of hard clams are time-consuming and prone to errors, particularly for volume estimation. This study introduces a low-cost, high-throughput method for measuring hard clam dimensions and volumes using digital 3D replicas and predicting fresh weight through machine learning. The extracted shell length, height, and width from 3D point cloud models demonstrated high accuracy (R2 >= 0.93). Although the extracted volumes showed some deviation from ground truth values (R2 = 0.60), the method provided a higher resolution of volume and was significantly faster than manual measurements. By combining the three extracted dimensions and volumes, fresh weight was accurately predicted using linear regression (R2 = 0.96). These results highlight the potential of the proposed method to significantly reduce labor costs while providing precise trait values to support the selective and genomic breeding of northern quahogs. Moreover, this method can be extended to accurate and fast phenotyping of other bivalve species, representing a substantial advancement in broodstock breeding technologies.

TI Dueling philosophies: Inclusion or separation for Florida's English
   language learners?
SO TESOL QUARTERLY
LA English
DT Article
AB Educational policies in Florida affect one of the United States' largest and most diverse student populations. A major consequence of the comprehensive restructuring of education for English language learners since 1990 has been a rapid move toward inclusion (mainstreaming) for these learners. The current study provides an overview of the historical background and philosophical bases of. inclusion versus separation and presents recent developments affecting L2 education policy and practice in Florida. Data from interviews with 29 district-level ESL administrators address their rationales for the models implemented in their districts and their beliefs about the effectiveness. of each model. Administrators expressed both positive and negative sentiments regarding inclusion and separation. The article notes parallel trends toward inclusion and standardization in national and international contexts. Findings document how issues of equity for English language learners have been forced into the background and why the specialized nature of the ESL/EFL teaching profession is in jeopardy.

AB Over the past few years, several approaches have been proposed to assist in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Using multi-modal biomarkers for this high-dimensional classification problem, the widely used algorithms include Support Vector Machines (SVM), Sparse Representation-based classification (SRC), Deep Belief Networks (DBN) and Random Forest (RF). These widely used algorithms continue to yield unsatisfactory performance for delineating the MCI participants from the cognitively normal control (CN) group. A novel Gaussian discriminant analysis-based algorithm is thus introduced to achieve a more effective and accurate classification performance than the aforementioned state-of-the-art algorithms. This study makes use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data uniquely as input to two separate high-dimensional decision spaces that reflect the structural measures of the two brain hemispheres. The data used include 190 CN, 305 MCI and 133 AD subjects as part of the AD Big Data DREAM Challenge #1. Using 80% data for a 10-fold cross-validation, the proposed algorithm achieved an average F1 score of 95.89% and an accuracy of 96.54% for discriminating AD from CN; and more importantly, an average F1 score of 92.08% and an accuracy of 90.26% for discriminating MCI from CN. Then, a true test was implemented on the remaining 20% held-out test data. For discriminating MCI from CN, an accuracy of 80.61%, a sensitivity of 81.97% and a specificity of 78.38% were obtained. These results show significant improvement over existing algorithms for discriminating the subtle differences between MCI participants and the CN group.

AB Simple Summary We investigated a new method for diagnosing and predicting outcomes in canine pulmonary carcinoma. We developed a deep learning-based algorithm that accurately detects tumor nuclei and subsequently measures size and shape parameters. The variation in nuclear size and shape (nuclear pleomorphism) is a crucial malignancy criterion used in the current grading system for canine pulmonary carcinoma. Pathologists currently evaluate it and classify it according to a three-tier system. Manual morphometry is a more objective approach where tumor nuclei are individually encircled and analyzed. This task can be easily performed by an algorithm. Our algorithm's accuracy in correctly detecting and segmenting tumor nuclei was considered good when compared to manual morphometry. By comparing automated morphometry with conventional prognostic tests, such as pathologists' estimates, mitotic count, histological grading, and clinical staging, we found that our approach was equally accurate in terms of prognostic value. The algorithm's advantage lies in its high reproducibility and efficiency. Automated evaluation of nuclear pleomorphism can enhance the efficiency and reliability of canine pulmonary carcinoma diagnosis and grading, effectively addressing issues of inter-observer reproducibility. However, further optimization of the algorithm and validation with a larger study group is necessary to confirm our findings.Abstract The integration of deep learning-based tools into diagnostic workflows is increasingly prevalent due to their efficiency and reproducibility in various settings. We investigated the utility of automated nuclear morphometry for assessing nuclear pleomorphism (NP), a criterion of malignancy in the current grading system in canine pulmonary carcinoma (cPC), and its prognostic implications. We developed a deep learning-based algorithm for evaluating NP (variation in size, i.e., anisokaryosis and/or shape) using a segmentation model. Its performance was evaluated on 46 cPC cases with comprehensive follow-up data regarding its accuracy in nuclear segmentation and its prognostic ability. Its assessment of NP was compared to manual morphometry and established prognostic tests (pathologists' NP estimates (n = 11), mitotic count, histological grading, and TNM-stage). The standard deviation (SD) of the nuclear area, indicative of anisokaryosis, exhibited good discriminatory ability for tumor-specific survival, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.80 and a hazard ratio (HR) of 3.38. The algorithm achieved values comparable to manual morphometry. In contrast, the pathologists' estimates of anisokaryosis resulted in HR values ranging from 0.86 to 34.8, with slight inter-observer reproducibility (k = 0.204). Other conventional tests had no significant prognostic value in our study cohort. Fully automated morphometry promises a time-efficient and reproducible assessment of NP with a high prognostic value. Further refinement of the algorithm, particularly to address undersegmentation, and application to a larger study population are required.

AB Active learning approaches are becoming of increasing importance within engineering education, and it has been established that an active learning environment leads to improved student outcomes. What are less known are the ways in which these classes support student learning. Our study takes place in the context of a Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) classroom. We use grounded theory to answer the research question: How do students construct knowledge in a POGIL classroom? Constructivist grounded theory was used to code student interview data and develop a theory of how student learning occurs. The resulting theory shows that the use of POGIL results in a concept-focused class, as opposed to focusing on discrete aspects of knowledge (facts). This concept-focused class provides for both conceptual understanding and improved retention of information. The findings illustrate one way to design a class for deep conceptual understanding and suggest broader implications for curriculum design.

AB Background: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among women in the US, predominantly due to ischemic heart disease (IHD). There is a notable deficiency in therapies tailored for IHD in women, who often present with variable symptoms that delay diagnosis and treatment. In many cases, coronary angiography does not reveal obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) despite increased risk for major adverse cardiac events (MACE) compared with sex and age-matched asymptomatic cohorts. Objectives: The Women's IschemiA TRial to Reduce Events in Nonobstructive CAD (WARRIOR) evaluates intensive medical treatment for women with Ischemia with No Obstructive Coronary Arteries (INOCA). The QUIET WARRIOR sub-study aims to improve predictive tools for adverse outcomes by detailed analysis of Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA) data and biorepository samples. These data will also uncover pathophysiological mechanisms associated with angina and MACE, improving predictive tools for symptomatic women with INOCA. Methods: This ancillary study will analyze CCTA images from 600 WARRIOR subjects. It will assess clinical, social, and coronary artery variables, including plaque characteristics and markers of inflammation. Advanced imaging techniques and machine-learning models will be employed to quantify plaque features and predict clinical outcomes. Expected results: The study aims to elucidate associations between CCTA-derived plaque characteristics, ischemic symptoms, and MACE. Anticipated findings include correlations of specific plaque attributes with angina severity and novel insights into inflammatory markers. Socioeconomic variables will also be examined for their impact on cardiovascular risk. Conclusion: The QUIET WARRIOR sub-study will advance the understanding of INOCA in women, integrating clinical, imaging, and socioeconomic data to enhance risk prediction and guide personalized therapeutic strategies. This research will address critical gaps in managing nonobstructive CAD, promoting more equitable cardiovascular care.

TI DeepPHiC: predicting promoter-centered chromatin interactions using a
   novel deep learning approach
SO BIOINFORMATICS
LA English
DT Article
ID GENOME; VARIANTS; SEQUENCE
AB Motivation: Promoter-centered chromatin interactions, which include promoter-enhancer (PE) and promoter-promoter (PP) interactions, are important to decipher gene regulation and disease mechanisms. The development of next-generation sequencing technologies such as promoter capture Hi-C (pcHi-C) leads to the discovery of promoter-centered chromatin interactions. However, pcHi-C experiments are expensive and thus may be unavailable for tissues/cell types of interest. In addition, these experiments may be underpowered due to insufficient sequencing depth or various artifacts, which results in a limited finding of interactions. Most existing computational methods for predicting chromatin interactions are based on in situ Hi-C and can detect chromatin interactions across the entire genome. However, they may not be optimal for predicting promoter-centered chromatin interactions.Results: We develop a supervised multi-modal deep learning model, which utilizes a comprehensive set of features such as genomic sequence, epigenetic signal, anchor distance, evolutionary features and DNA structural features to predict tissue/cell type-specific PE and PP interactions. We further extend the deep learning model in a multi-task learning and a transfer learning framework and demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Moreover, the proposed approach can achieve comparable prediction performance using predefined biologically relevant tissues/cell types compared to using all tissues/cell types in the pretraining especially for predicting PE interactions. The prediction performance can be further improved by using computationally inferred biologically relevant tissues/cell types in the pretraining, which are defined based on the common genes in the proximity of two anchors in the chromatin interactions.

AB In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have seen rapid advancement and adoption, and are increasingly being used in educational contexts. In this perspective article, we explore the open challenge of leveraging LLMs to create personalized learning environments that support the "whole learner" by modeling and adapting to both cognitive and non-cognitive characteristics. We identify three key challenges toward this vision: (1) improving the interpretability of LLMs' representations of whole learners, (2) implementing adaptive technologies that can leverage such representations to provide tailored pedagogical support, and (3) authoring and evaluating LLM-based educational agents. For interpretability, we discuss approaches for explaining LLM behaviors in terms of their internal representations of learners; for adaptation, we examine how LLMs can be used to provide context-aware feedback and scaffold non-cognitive skills through natural language interactions; and for authoring, we highlight the opportunities and challenges involved in using natural language instructions to specify behaviors of educational agents. Addressing these challenges will enable personalized AI tutors that can enhance learning by accounting for each student's unique background, abilities, motivations, and socioemotional needs.

AB One of the grand challenges in modern theoretical chemistry is designing and implementing approximations that expedite ab initio methods without loss of accuracy. Machine learning (ML) methods are emerging as a powerful approach to constructing various forms of transferable atomistic potentials. They have been successfully applied in a variety of applications in chemistry, biology, catalysis, and solid-state physics. However, these models are heavily dependent on the quality and quantity of data used in their fitting. Fitting highly flexible ML potentials, such as neural networks, comes at a cost: a vast amount of reference data is required to properly train these models. We address this need by providing access to a large computational DFT database, which consists of more than 20M off equilibrium conformations for 57,462 small organic molecules. We believe it will become a new standard benchmark for comparison of current and future methods in the ML potential community.

AB This paper presents a game in which players can customize the behavior of their characters using their own movements while playing the game. Players' movements are recorded with a motion capture system. The player then labels the movements and uses them as input to a machine learning algorithm that generates a responsive behavior model. This interface supports a more embodied approach to character design that we call "Customizing by Doing". We present a user study which shows that using their own movements made the users feel more engaged with the game and the design process, due in large part to a feeling of personal ownership of the movement.

AB Traditional methods of drug design have relied on maximization of drug activity, which, however, often produce highly potent derivatives with equally elevated toxicities, resulting in no change in the therapeutic index. Inclusion of metabolic and toxicological considerations in the drug design process is embodied in retrometabolic concepts. This systemic methodology employs several rules for design of safe drugs, either by metabolic activation (chemical delivery systems) or strategic enzymatic deactivation processes (soft drugs). Automation of these drug design processes was accomplished by artificial intelligence-based computer programs. Thus, new structures are generated from any lead compound, using the ''soft analog'' and the ''inactive metabolite'' approach strategies. All structures are conformationally optimized. Then they are ranked based on calculated properties: solubility and partition characteristics, isosteric-isoelectronic comparison to the lead, and estimated metabolic rates of the predicted enzymatic degradation.

AB Supervised learning is conventionally performed with pairwise input-output labeled data. After the training procedure, the adaptive system's weights are fixed while the testing procedure with unlabeled data is performed. Recently, in an attempt to improve classification performance unlabeled data has been exploited in the machine learning community. In this paper, we present an information theoretic learning (ITL) approach based on density divergence minimization to obtain an extended training algorithm using unlabeled data during the testing. The method uses a boosting-like algorithm with an ITL based cost function. Preliminary simulations suggest that the method has the potential to improve the performance of classifiers in the application phase. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background Composition of microbial communities can be location-specific, and the different abundance of taxon within location could help us to unravel city-specific signature and predict the sample origin locations accurately. In this study, the whole genome shotgun (WGS) metagenomics data from samples across 16 cities around the world and samples from another 8 cities were provided as the main and mystery datasets respectively as the part of the CAMDA 2019 MetaSUB "Forensic Challenge". The feature selecting, normalization, three methods of machine learning, PCoA (Principal Coordinates Analysis) and ANCOM (Analysis of composition of microbiomes) were conducted for both the main and mystery datasets. Results Features selecting, combined with the machines learning methods, revealed that the combination of the common features was effective for predicting the origin of the samples. The average error rates of 11.93 and 30.37% of three machine learning methods were obtained for main and mystery datasets respectively. Using the samples from main dataset to predict the labels of samples from mystery dataset, nearly 89.98% of the test samples could be correctly labeled as "mystery" samples. PCoA showed that nearly 60% of the total variability of the data could be explained by the first two PCoA axes. Although many cities overlapped, the separation of some cities was found in PCoA. The results of ANCOM, combined with importance score from the Random Forest, indicated that the common "family", "order" of the main-dataset and the common "order" of the mystery dataset provided the most efficient information for prediction respectively. Conclusions The results of the classification suggested that the composition of the microbiomes was distinctive across the cities, which could be used to identify the sample origins. This was also supported by the results from ANCOM and importance score from the RF. In addition, the accuracy of the prediction could be improved by more samples and better sequencing depth.

AB Recent calls to take up data science either revolve around the superior predictive performance associated with machine learning or the potential of data science techniques for exploratory data analysis. Many believe that these strengths come at the cost of explanatory insights, which form the basis for theorization. In this paper, we show that this trade-off is false. When used as a part of a full research process, including inductive, deductive and abductive steps, machine learning can offer explanatory insights and provide a solid basis for theorization. We present a systematic five-step theory-building and theory-testing cycle that consists of: 1. Element identification (reduction); 2. Exploratory analysis (induction); 3. Hypothesis development (retroduction); 4. Hypothesis testing (deduction); and 5. Theorization (abduction). We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach, which we refer to as co-duction, in a vignette where we study firm growth with real-world observational data.

AB Predictive policing, the practice of using of algorithmic systems to forecast crime, is heralded by police departments as the new frontier of crime analysis. At the same time, it is opposed by civil rights groups, academics, and media outlets for being 'biased' and therefore discriminatory against communities of color. This paper argues that the prevailing focus on racial bias has overshadowed two normative factors that are essential to a full assessment of the moral permissibility of predictive policing: fairness in the social distribution of the benefits and burdens of policing as well as the distinctive role of consent in determining fair distribution. When these normative factors are given their due attention, several requirements emerge for the fair implementation of predictive policing. Among these requirements are that police departments inform and solicit buy-in from affected communities about strategic decision-making and that departments favor non-enforcement-oriented interventions.

AB The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether dogs that exhibit stereotypy also show higher behavioral persistence in an extinction-learning task. Thirteen pet dogs with stereotypy and 13 breed-matched control dogs were assessed on a resistance to extinction test. Each dog was trained for 40 trials using a food reinforcer to nose-touch the experimenter's hand on a continuous reinforcement schedule. After acquisition, the dogs entered an extinction phase, during which food was no longer delivered. The numbers of nose-touches as well as inter-response times during this phase were recorded. A linear regression found that stereotypy status (t = -2.46, P = .027) and breed type (t = 2.44, P = .023) were significant predictors of the number of responses in extinction. Dogs with stereotypy responded more in extinction than control dogs. The mean number of responses was 13.4 (SD = 14.7) in the control group and 26.0 (SD = 15.3) in the stereotypy group. These results suggest a link between previous laboratory and zoo animal findings on the neurophysiology of stereotypy and the pet dog population. They also have implications for the use of extinction procedures to reduce stereotypic behaviors in pet dogs, as these dogs show enhanced resistance to extinction. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB Massively open online courses (MOOCs) offer learners opportunities for self-improvement and knowledge development. Linking cognitive processes and learning outcomes is helpful in supporting students learning with the help of MOOCs. Based on the cognitive presence of the Community of Inquiry framework, this study quantified the effect of cognitive presence on students' learning performance by analysing more than 400,000 posts of 13 MOOCs. First, the study built a highly predictive classification model using a machine learning algorithm to automatically identify the phases of cognitive presence in MOOC forum posts. Subsequently, multilevel modelling was used to analyse the influence of learners' cognitive presence on their learning performance. The results showed that different phases of cognitive presence influenced students' learning differently. The findings help us understand the phases and depth of students' cognitive presence and can be used as the basis for MOOCs to automatically provide appropriate cognitive feedback and support to students.

AB The clock drawing test is a simple and inexpensive method to screen for cognitive frailties, including dementia. In this study, we used the relevance factor variational autoencoder (RF-VAE), a deep generative neural network, to represent digitized clock drawings from multiple institutions using an optimal number of disentangled latent factors. The model identified unique constructional features of clock drawings in a completely unsupervised manner. These factors were examined by domain experts to be novel and not extensively examined in prior research. The features were informative, as they distinguished dementia from non-dementia patients with an area under receiver operating characteristic (AUC) of 0.86 singly, and 0.96 when combined with participants' demographics. The correlation network of the features depicted the "typical dementia clock" as having a small size, a non-circular or "avocado-like" shape, and incorrectly placed hands. In summary, we report a RF-VAE network whose latent space encoded novel constructional features of clocks that classify dementia from non-dementia patients with high performance.

AB Aerodynamic shape optimization is very useful for enhancing the performance of wind-sensitive structures. However, shape parameterization, as the first step in the pipeline of aerodynamic shape optimization, still heavily depends on empirical judgment. If not done properly, the resulting small design space may fail to cover many promising shapes, and hence hinder realizing the full potential of aerodynamic shape optimization. To this end, developing a novel shape parameterization scheme that can reflect real-world complexities while being simple enough for the subsequent optimization process is important. This study proposes a machine learning-based scheme that can automatically learn a low-dimensional latent representation of complex aerodynamic shapes for bluff-body wind-sensitive structures. The resulting latent representation (as design variables for aerodynamic shape optimization) is composed of both discrete and continuous variables, which are embedded in a hierarchy structure. In addition to being intuitive and interpretable, the mixed discrete and continuous variables with the hierarchy structure allow stakeholders to narrow the search space selectively based on their interests. As a proof-of-concept study, shape parameterization examples of tall building cross sections are used to demonstrate the promising features of the proposed scheme and guide future investigations on data-driven parameterization for aerodynamic shape optimization of wind-sensitive structures.

AB This study presents one of the earliest empirical investigations on how to harness the power of chatbots for improving key public relations outcomes. Specifically, this study integrates the construct of social presence that has been widely studied in the computer-mediated communication literature with the concept of conversational human voice in public relations to conceptualize chatbots' social conversation. We evaluate chatbots' social conversation as an important antecedent driving user perception, not only of chatbots' listening capability, but also of the organizations' listening efforts, which, in turn, enhance the essential perceptual outcomes of organizational transparency and organization-public relationships. Our theoretical model was tested through an online survey of 778 adult Facebook users in the US, who were directed to have a 5-minute conversation with a real chatbot. The study results advance the organizational listening literature and contribute to the growing body of knowledge on artificial intelligence in public relations.

AB In this paper, we study a single machine scheduling problem by simultaneously considering the processing method of serial-batching, learning effect, resource-dependent processing times, and setup operations. We consider minimizing the makespan as the objective of the studied problem under the constraint that the total resource consumption does not exceed a given limit. For the special case where the resource allocation is given, we first propose the structural properties for job batching policies and batching sequencing, and an optimal batching policy is derived based on these properties. Then, we develop a novel hybrid GSA-TS algorithm which combines the Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) and the Tabu Search (TS) algorithm to solve the general case. Computational experiments with different scales show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB The large N-c limit of Yang-Mills gauge theory is the dynamics of a closed gluonic chain, but this fact does not obviate the inherently strong coupling nature of the dynamical problem. However, we suggest that a single link in such a chain might be reasonably described in the quasi-perturbative language of gluons and their interactions. To implement this idea, we use the MIT bag to model the physics of a nearest neighbor bond. [S0556-2821(99)02211-0].

   Learning; Enterprise Collaboration; Forecasting Tools
AB With the penetration of deep learning technology into forecasting and decision support systems, enterprises have an increasingly urgent need for accurate forecasting of time series data. Especially in fields such as finance, retail, and production, immediate and accurate predictions of market trends are the key to maintaining a competitive advantage. This study aims to address the limitations of traditional time series forecasting methods, such as the difficulty in adapting to the nonlinearity and non-stationarity of the data, through an innovative deep learning framework. The authors propose a Prophet model that combines deep learning with LSTNet and statistics. In this way, they combine the ability of LSTNet to handle complex time dependencies and the flexibility of the Prophet model to handle trends and periodicity. The particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) is responsible for tuning this hybrid model, aiming to improve the accuracy of predictions. Such a strategy not only helps capture long-term dependencies in time series, but also models seasonality and holiday effects well.

AB Accurate measurement of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and soil moisture content (SMC) is critical for different purposes, including developing irrigation scheduling practices that improve water use efficiency and crop yield. The objectives of this study were to 1) simulate daily ETc and SMC of green beans and sweet corn under full irrigation and three deficit irrigation rates using the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) CROPGRO-Green bean and CERES-Sweet corn models and 2) evaluate the performance of three machine learning models for simulating ETc of green beans and sweet corn. The DSSAT models were calibrated using measured phenological, biomass, and yield data collected during two years of experiments at the University of Florida, Tropical Research and Education Center (TREC) during the winter (dry) seasons of 2020-21 and 2021-22. The experiments were conducted under four irrigation treatments: 100% full irrigation (FI), 75% FI, 50% FI, and 25% FI, with four replications. The simulated daily ETc and SMC under each irrigation treatment were compared with estimated ETc based on changes in SMC and measured SMC, respectively. Estimating ETc based on changes in SMC involved quantifying sub-hourly moisture loss during the drying phase of soil and aggregating the results into daily timesteps. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), light gradient-boosting machine (LightGBM), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models were trained using SMC and weather variables to simulate daily ETc of green beans and sweet corn. The results showed that the CROPGRO and CERES models could reasonably simulate SMC dynamics of green beans and sweet corn plots. The models simulated SMC better for the three deficit irrigation treatments than the full irrigation treatment. The CROPGRO model evaluation index of agreement (d-Stat) and mean absolute error (MAE) for 25% FI treatment were 0.72 and 0.03 cm3 cm-3, and 0.75 and 0.03 cm3 cm-3 for the CERES model. However, the DSSAT models did not perform well in simulating ETc for green beans and sweet corn. Average d-Stat and MAE for the CROPGRO during model evaluation were 0.5- and 1.0-mm day-1 and 0.6- and 1.1-mm day-1 for CERES, respectively. The performance of all machine learning (ML) models for simulating daily ETc of green beans and sweet corn was better than the CROPGRO and CERES models. Incorporating machine learning algorithms into the DSSAT model has the potential to enhance its performance in simulating ETc. Overall, the results suggest that DSSAT and ML models could potentially be used as alternative decision support tools for assessing and managing irrigation strategies and optimizing water use efficiency under different management and environmental conditions.

AB Four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy, coupled with a wide array of data analytics, has unveiled new insights into complex materials. Here, we introduce a straightforward unsupervised machine learning approach that entails dimensionality reduction and clustering with minimal hyperparameter tuning to semi-automatically identify unique coexisting structures in metallic alloys. Applying cepstral transformation to the original diffraction dataset improves this process by effectively isolating phase information from potential signal ambiguity caused by sample tilt and thickness variations, commonly observed in electron diffraction patterns. In a case study of a NiTiHfAl shape memory alloy, conventional scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging struggles to accurately identify a low-contrast precipitate at lower magnifications, posing challenges for microscale analyses. We find that our method efficiently separates multiple coherent structures while using objective means of determining hyperparameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the clustering result facilitates more robust strain mapping to provide immediate and quantitative structural insights.

AB The era of PUFs has been characterized by the efforts put into research and the development of PUFs that are resilient against attacks, in particular, machine learning attacks. Due to the lack of systematic and provable methods for this purpose, we have witnessed the ever-continuing competition between PUF designers/manufacturers, cryptanalysts, and of course, adversaries that maliciously break the security of PUFs. This is despite a series of acknowledged principles developed in cryptography and complexity theory, under the umbrella term "hardness amplification". This paper aims at narrowing the gap between these studies and hardware security, specifically for applications in the domain of PUFs. To this end, this paper provides an example of somewhat hard PUFs and demonstrates how to build a strongly secure construction out of these considerably weaker primitives. Our theoretical findings are discussed in an exhaustive manner and supported by the silicon results captured from real-world PUFs.

AB This paper deals with serial-batching scheduling problems with the effects of deterioration and learning, where time-dependent setup time is also considered. In the proposed scheduling models, all jobs are first partitioned into serial batches, and then all batches are processed on a single serial-batching machine. The actual job processing time is a function of its starting time and position. In addition, a setup time is required when a new batch is processed, and the setup time of the batches is time-dependent, i.e., it is a linear function of its starting time. Structural properties are derived for the problems of minimizing the makespan, the number of tardy jobs, and the maximum earliness. Then, three optimization algorithms are developed to solve them, respectively.

AB Individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) have deficits in adaptive behavior, slow rates of learning, and behavior disorders that interfere with learning or place them or others at risk. Since the 1960s, researchers and clinicians in the field of applied behavior analysis have used methods based on principles of learning to increase adaptive behavior and decrease the occurrence of behavior disorders of individuals with IDD. This article provides an overview of assessment and treatment strategies used in behavior analysis to effect positive changes in the quality of life for individuals with IDD and presents an illustrative case study.

AB There is ongoing debate regarding the merits of decriminalization or outright legalization of commercial sex work in the United States. A few municipalities have officially legalized both the selling and purchasing of sex, while others unofficially criminalize purchasing sex but have decriminalized its sale. In addition, there are many other locales with no official guidance on the subject but have unofficially decriminalized sex work by designating specific areas in an urban landscape safe from law enforcement for commercial sex, by quietly ceasing to arrest sex sellers, or by declining to prosecute anyone selling or attempting to sell sex. Despite these efforts, it remains crucial to understand where in an urban area commercial sex exchanges occur-legalization and decriminalization may result in fewer arrests but is likely to increase the overall size of the sex market. This growth could result in an increase in sex trafficking victimization, which makes up the majority of commercial sex sellers in any domestic market. Given the distribution of prostitution activities in most communities, it is possible to use high-fidelity predictive models to identify intervention opportunities related to sex trafficking victimization. In this research, we construct several machine learning models and inform them with a range of known criminogenic factors to predict locations hosting high levels of prostitution. We demonstrate these methods in the city of Chicago, Illinois. The results of this exploratory analysis identified a range of explanatory factors driving prostitution activity throughout Chicago, and the best-performing model correctly predicted prostitution frequency with 94% accuracy. We conclude by exploring specific areas of under- and over-prediction throughout Chicago and discuss the implications of these results for allocating social support efforts.

AB Simple Summary Accounting for 10% of the new cases in 2020, colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide. Unfortunately, CRC is frequently identified at a later stage, despite the fact that early detection greatly increases survival rates. Diagnostic endoscopy is the gold standard; however, identifying abnormalities at an early stage is challenging. In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are being used by researchers to improve detection through deep learning. But prior approaches were primarily concerned with polyp detection. This work provided a novel method for polyp segmentation and endoscopic pathological finding categorization using vision transformers and spatial transformers for the early identification of colorectal cancer (CRC). These approaches perform noticeably better than the current CNN-based algorithms. This work opens up exciting possibilities for improving on early CRC detection beyond just identifying polyps.Abstract Endoscopic pathological findings of the gastrointestinal tract are crucial for the early diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Previous deep learning works, aimed at improving CRC detection performance and reducing subjective analysis errors, are limited to polyp segmentation. Pathological findings were not considered and only convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are not able to handle global image feature information, were utilized. This work introduces a novel vision transformer (ViT)-based approach for early CRC detection. The core components of the proposed approach are ViTCol, a boosted vision transformer for classifying endoscopic pathological findings, and PUTS, a vision transformer-based model for polyp segmentation. Results demonstrate the superiority of this vision transformer-based CRC detection method over existing CNN and vision transformer models. ViTCol exhibited an outstanding performance in classifying pathological findings, with an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) value of 0.9999 +/- 0.001 on the Kvasir dataset. PUTS provided outstanding results in segmenting polyp images, with mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 0.8673 and 0.9092 on the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-Clinic datasets, respectively. This work underscores the value of spatial transformers in localizing input images, which can seamlessly integrate into the main vision transformer network, enhancing the automated identification of critical image features for early CRC detection.

With the rapid development of information technology, massive data collection is relatively easier and cheaper than ever before. The challenge is how to provide database users with reliable and useful data while protecting the privacy of the confidential information. This paper discusses how to prevent disclosing the identity of unique records in a statistical database. The authors' research extends previous work and shows how much protection is necessary to prevent an adversary from discovering confidential data with high probability at small error.

AB With the rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, location-based services have been widely applied in the construction of smart cities. Satellite-based location services have been utilized in outdoor environments, but they are not suitable for indoor technology due to the absence of global positioning system (GPS) signal. Therefore, many indoor localization technologies and systems have emerged by utilizing many other signals. In particular, fingerprinting localization has recently garnered attention because its promising performance. In this work, we aim to study recent indoor localization technologies and systems based on various fingerprints, which use machine learning and intelligent algorithms. We also present the architecture of intelligent localization. The development of indoor localization technology should have the ability of self-adaptation and self-learning in the future. And the architecture shows how to make localization become more "smart" by advanced techniques. The state-of-the-art localization systems' working principles are summarized and compared in terms of their localization accuracy, latency, energy consumption, complexity, and robustness. We also discuss the challenges of existing indoor localization technologies, potential solutions to these challenges, and possible improvement measures.

AB As incorporation of RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) tags in a wide variety of applications increase, there is a need to ensure the security and privacy of the entity to which these tags are attached. Not surprisingly, this is a very active area as attested by the large number of related published research literature. Recently, the journal engineering applications of artificial intelligence published a paper by Chen and Deng (2009) where the authors propose a mutual authentication protocol for RFID. This protocol has fundamental flaws that can be readily taken advantage by a resourceful adversary. We identify and discuss these vulnerabilities and point out the characteristics of this protocol that exposes it to these vulnerabilities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study is devoted to developing a platoon-based cooperative lane-change control (PB-CLC). It coordinates the trajectories of a CAV platoon under a platoon-centered platooning control to accommodate the CAV lane-change requests from its adjacent lane, aiming to reduce the negative traffic impacts on the platoon resulting from lane-change maneuvers, on the premise of ensuring CAVs' safety and mobility. Mathematically, the PB-CLC control is established using a hybrid model predictive control (MPC) system. The hybrid MPC system involves an MPC-based mixed integer nonlinear programming optimizer (MINLP-MPC) for optimal lane-change decisions, which considers multiple objectives such as traffic smoothness, driving comfort and lane-change response promptness subject to vehicle dynamics and safety constraints. To ensure the feasible lane-change, this study investigates and provides a lower bound of the lane-change time window by analyzing the MINLP-MPC model feasibility. Apart from the optimal lane-change decision consideration, the hybrid MPC system is well designed to ensure the control continuity and smoothness. In particular, the hybrid MPC system control feasibility and stability are proved to enable the platoon's back-and-forth state switchings between car-following and lane-change accommodation states. Next, we developed a machine learning aided distributed branch and bound algorithm (ML-DBB) to solve the MINLP-MPC model within a control sampling time interval (< 1 second). Specifically, built upon computer simulation and the c-LHS sampling technique, supervised machine learning models are developed offline to predict a reduced solution space of the integer variables, which is further integrated into the distributed branch and bound method to solve the MINLP-MPC model efficiently online. Extensive numerical experiments validate the effectiveness and applicability of the ML-DBB algorithm and the PB-CLC control.

TI Development of a Computable Phenotype for Prehospital Pediatric Asthma
   Encounters
SO PREHOSPITAL EMERGENCY CARE
LA English
DT Article
ID CARE
AB IntroductionAsthma exacerbations are a common cause of pediatric Emergency Medical Services (EMS) encounters. Accordingly, prehospital management of pediatric asthma exacerbations has been designated an EMS research priority. However, accurate identification of pediatric asthma exacerbations from the prehospital record is nuanced and difficult due to the heterogeneity of asthma symptoms, especially in children. Therefore, this study's objective was to develop a prehospital-specific pediatric asthma computable phenotype (CP) that could accurately identify prehospital encounters for pediatric asthma exacerbations.MethodsThis is a retrospective observational study of patient encounters for ages 2-18 years from the ESO Data Collaborative between 2018 and 2021. We modified two existing rule-based pediatric asthma CPs and created three new CPs (one rule-based and two machine learning-based). Two pediatric emergency medicine physicians independently reviewed encounters to assign labels of asthma exacerbation or not. Taking that labeled encounter data, a 50/50 train/test split was used to create training and test sets from the labeled data. A 90/10 split was used to create a small validation set from the training set. We used specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and macro F1 to compare performance across all CP models.ResultsAfter applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 24,283 patient encounters remained. The machine-learning models exhibited the best performance for the identification of pediatric asthma exacerbations. A multi-layer perceptron-based model had the best performance in all metrics, with an F1 score of 0.95, specificity of 1.00, sensitivity of 0.91, negative predictive value of 0.98, and positive predictive value of 1.00.ConclusionWe modified existing and developed new pediatric asthma CPs to retrospectively identify prehospital pediatric asthma exacerbation encounters. We found that machine learning-based models greatly outperformed rule-based models. Given the high performance of the machine-learning models, the development and application of machine learning-based CPs for other conditions and diseases could help accelerate EMS research and ultimately enhance clinical care by accurately identifying patients with conditions of interest.

AB Aims Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is associated with a substantial rate of adverse events. We sought to design a machine learning (ML)-based model to predict the risk of in-hospital death and to perform a clustering of TTS patients to identify different risk profiles.Methods and results A ridge logistic regression-based ML model for predicting in-hospital death was developed on 3482 TTS patients from the International Takotsubo (InterTAK) Registry, randomly split in a train and an internal validation cohort (75% and 25% of the sample size, respectively) and evaluated in an external validation cohort (1037 patients). Thirty-one clinically relevant variables were included in the prediction model. Model performance represented the primary endpoint and was assessed according to area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity. As secondary endpoint, a K-medoids clustering algorithm was designed to stratify patients into phenotypic groups based on the 10 most relevant features emerging from the main model. The overall incidence of in-hospital death was 5.2%. The InterTAK-ML model showed an AUC of 0.89 (0.85-0.92), a sensitivity of 0.85 (0.78-0.95) and a specificity of 0.76 (0.74-0.79) in the internal validation cohort and an AUC of 0.82 (0.73-0.91), a sensitivity of 0.74 (0.61-0.87) and a specificity of 0.79 (0.77-0.81) in the external cohort for in-hospital death prediction. By exploiting the 10 variables showing the highest feature importance, TTS patients were clustered into six groups associated with different risks of in-hospital death (28.8% vs. 15.5% vs. 5.4% vs. 1.0.8% vs. 0.5%) which were consistent also in the external cohort.Conclusion A ML-based approach for the identification of TTS patients at risk of adverse short-term prognosis is feasible and effective. The InterTAK-ML model showed unprecedented discriminative capability for the prediction of in-hospital death.

AB We examine the discovery potential for double Higgs production at the high luminosity LHC in the final state with two b-tagged jets, two leptons and missing transverse momentum. Although this dilepton final state has been considered a difficult channel due to the large backgrounds, we argue that it is possible to obtain sizable signal significance, by adopting a deep learning framework making full use of the relevant kinematics along with the jet images from the Higgs decay. For the relevant number of signal events we obtain a substantial increase in signal sensitivity over existing analyses. We discuss relative improvements at each stage and the correlations among the different input variables for the neutral network. The proposed method can be easily generalized to the semi-leptonic channel of double Higgs production, as well as to other processes with similar final states.

AB In supervised learning, obtaining a large set of fully-lab eled training data is expensive. We show that we do not always need full label information on every single training example to train a competent classifier. Specifically, inspired by the principle of sufficiency in statistics, we present a statistic (a summary) of the fully-lab eled training set that captures almost all the relevant information for classification but at the same time is easier to obtain directly. We call this statistic "sufficiently-lab eled data" and prove its sufficiency and efficiency for finding the optimal hidden representations, on which competent classifier heads can be trained using as few as a single randomly-chosen fully-lab eled example per class. Sufficiently-lab eled data can be obtained from annotators directly without collecting the fully-lab eled data first. And we prove that it is easier to directly obtain sufficiently-lab eled data than obtaining fully-lab eled data. Furthermore, sufficiently-lab eled data is naturally more secure since it stores relative, instead of absolute, information. Extensive experimental results are provided to support our theory.

AB Accurately forecasting the real-time travel demand for dockless scooter-sharing is crucial for the planning and operations of transportation systems. Deep learning models provide researchers with powerful tools to achieve this task, but research in this area is still lacking. This paper thus proposes a novel deep learning architecture named Spatio-Temporal Multi-Graph Transformer (STMGT) to forecast the real-time spatiotemporal dockless scooter-sharing demand. The proposed model uses a graph convolutional network (GCN) based on adjacency graph, functional similarity graph, demographic similarity graph, and transportation supply similarity graph to attach spatial dependency to temporal input (i.e., historical demand). The output of GCN is subsequently processed with weather condition information by the Transformer to capture temporal dependency. Then, a convolutional layer is used to generate the final prediction. The proposed model is evaluated for two real-world case studies in Washington, D.C. and Austin, TX, respectively, and the results show that for both case studies, STMGT significantly outperforms all the selected benchmark models, and the most important model component is the weather information. The proposed model can help the micromobility operators develop optimal vehicle rebalancing schemes and guide cities to better manage dockless scooter-sharing operations.

ID CONSERVATION
AB The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment is a next-generation neutrino oscillation experiment that aims to measure CP-violation in the neutrino sector as part of a wider physics program. A deep learning approach based on a convolutional neural network has been developed to provide highly efficient and pure selections of electron neutrino and muon neutrino charged-current interactions. The electron neutrino (antineutrino) selection efficiency peaks at 90% (94%) and exceeds 85% (90%) for reconstructed neutrino energies between 2-5 GeV. The muon neutrino (antineutrino) event selection is found to have a maximum efficiency of 96% (97%) and exceeds 90% (95%) efficiency for reconstructed neutrino energies above 2 GeV. When considering all electron neutrino and antineutrino interactions as signal, a selection purity of 90% is achieved. These event selections are critical to maximize the sensitivity of the experiment to CP-violating effects.

TI Artificial Intelligence and Surgery: Ethical Dilemmas and Open Issues
SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
LA English
DT Article
ID MEDICAL DEVICES; SCIENCE
AB BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) applications aiming to support surgical decision-making processes are generating novel threats to ethical surgical care. To understand and address these threats, we summarize the main ethical issues that may arise from applying AI to surgery, starting from the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence framework recently promoted by the European Commission.
   STUDY DESIGN: A modified Delphi process has been employed to achieve expert consensus.
   RESULTS: The main ethical issues that arise from applying AI to surgery, described in detail here, relate to human agency, accountability for errors, technical robustness, privacy and data governance, transparency, diversity, non-discrimination, and fairness. It may be possible to address many of these ethical issues by expanding the breadth of surgical AI research to focus on implementation science. The potential for AI to disrupt surgical practice suggests that formal digital health education is becoming increasingly important for surgeons and surgical trainees.
   CONCLUSIONS: A multidisciplinary focus on implementation science and digital health education is desirable to balance opportunities offered by emerging AI technologies and respect for the ethical principles of a patient-centric philosophy.

ID INDOOR LOCALIZATION
AB With the growing demand of Location-Based Service, the fingerprint localization based on Channel State Information (CSI) has become a vital positioning technology because it has easy implementation, low device cost and adequate accuracy which benefits from fine-grained information provided by CSI. However, the main drawback is that the approach has to construct the fingerprint map manually during the off-line stage, which is tedious and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a novel data collection strategy for path planning based on reinforcement learning, namely Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C). Given the limited exploration step length, it needs to maximize the informative CSI data for reducing manual cost. We collect a small amount of real data in advance to predict the rewards of all sampling points by multivariate Gaussian process and mutual information. Then the optimization problem is transformed into a sequential decision process, which can exploit the informative path by A3C. We complete the proposed algorithm in two real-world dynamic environments and extensive experiments verify its performance. Compared to coverage path planning and several existing algorithms, our system not only can achieve similar indoor localization accuracy, but also reduce the CSI collection task.

AB Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a disorder associated with fatigue, pain, and structural/functional abnormalities seen during magnetic resonance brain imaging (MRI). Therefore, we evaluated the performance of structural MRI (sMRI) abnormalities in the classification of CFS patients versus healthy controls and compared it to machine learning (ML) classification based upon self-report (SR). Participants included 18 CFS patients and 15 healthy controls (HC). All subjects underwent T1-weighted sMRI and provided visual analogue-scale ratings of fatigue, pain intensity, anxiety, depression, anger, and sleep quality. sMRI data were segmented using FreeSurfer and 61 regions based on functional and structural abnormalities previously reported in patients with CFS. Classification was performed in RapidMiner using a linear support vector machine and bootstrap optimism correction. We compared ML classifiers based on (1) 61 a priori sMRI regional estimates and (2) SR ratings. The sMRI model achieved 79.58% classification accuracy. The SR (accuracy = 95.95%) outperformed both sMRI models. Estimates from multiple brain areas related to cognition, emotion, and memory contributed strongly to group classification. This is the first ML-based group classification of CFS. Our findings suggest that sMRI abnormalities are useful for discriminating CFS patients from HC, but SR ratings remain most effective in classification tasks.

AB This paper proposes and tests a novel model of human-robot interaction and the service robots' acceptance. We used Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze the impact of human-robot interaction (anthropomorphism, perceived intelligence, and perceived social interactivity), psychological (wow effect, emotional presence, and psychological characteristics), utilitarian (perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness) factors and trust on service robot adoption among 446 participants. Our findings show that two main factors influence patron's intention to use service robots: the "wow effect" and ease of use. We also show that human-robot interaction and psychological factors positively influence a patron's perceived ease of use of a robot. Further, psychological factors played a role in influencing patron's trust in the service robot. Finally, for those who preferred interacting with a human, the impact of human-robot interaction factors on ease of use was canceled.

AB Particulate matter (PM), while not an emerging contaminant, remains the primary labile substrate for parti-tioning and transport of emerging and known chemicals and pathogens. As a common unit operation and also green infrastructure, clarification basins are widely implemented to sequester PM as well as PM-partitioned chemicals and pathogens. Despite ubiquitous application for urban drainage, stormwater clarification basin design and optimization lacks robust and efficient design guidance and tools. Current basin design and regulation primarily adopt residence time (RT) as presumptive guidance. This study examines the accuracy and general-izability of RT and nondimensional groups of basin geometric and dynamic similarity (Hazen, Reynolds, Schmidt numbers) to scale clarification basin performance (measured as PM separation and total PM separation). Pub-lished data and 160,000 computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of basin PM separation over a wide range of basin configurations, loading conditions, and PM granulometry (particle size distribution [PSD], den-sity) are examined. Based on the CFD database, a novel implementation of machine learning (ML) models: de-cision tree (DT), random forest (RF), artificial neural networks (ANN), and symbolic regression (SR) are developed and trained as surrogate models for basin PM separation predictions. Study results indicate that: (1) Models based solely on RT are not accurate or generalizable for basin PM separation, with significant differences between CFD and RT models primarily for RT < 200 hr, (2) RT models are agnostic to basin configurations and PM granulometrics and therefore do not reproduce total PM separation, (3) Trained ML models provide high predictive capability, with (R-2) above 0.99 and prediction for total PM separation within +/- 15%. In particular, the SR model distilled from CFD simulations is entirely defined by only two compact algebraic equations (allowing use in a spreadsheet tool). The SR model has a physical basis and indicates PM separation is primarily a function of the Hazen number and basin horizontal and vertical aspect ratios, (4) With common presumptive guidance of 80% for PM separation, a Pareto frontier analysis indicates that the CFD-ML augmented SR model generates significant economic benefit for basin planning/design, and (5) CFD-ML models show that enlarging basin dimensions (increasing RT) to address impaired behavior can result in exponential cost increases, irre-spective of land/infrastructure adjacency conflicts. CFD-ML applications can extend to intra-basin retrofits (permeable baffles) to upgrade impaired basins.

AB Accurate air quality forecasts can provide data-driven supports for governmental departments to control air pollution and further protect the health of residents. However, existing air quality forecasting models mainly focus on site-specific time series forecasts at a local level, and rarely consider the spatiotemporal relationships among regional monitoring stations. As a novelty, we construct a diffusion convolutional recurrent neural network (DCRNN) model that fully considers the influence of geographic distance and dominant wind direction on the regional variations in air quality through different combinations of directed and undirected graphs. The hourly fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone data from 123 air quality monitoring stations in the Yangtze River Delta, China are used to evaluate the performance of the DCRNN model in the regional prediction of PM2.5 and ozone concentrations. Results show that the proposed DCRNN model outperforms the baseline models in prediction accuracy. Compared with the undirected graph model, the directed graph model considering the effects of wind direction performs better in 24 h predictions of pollutant concentrations. In addition, more accurate forecasts of both PM2.5 and ozone are found at a regional level where monitoring stations are distributed densely rather than sparsely. Therefore, the proposed model can assist environmental researchers to further improve the technologies of air quality forecasts and could also serve as tools for environmental policymakers to implement pollution control measures.

AB As Moore's law comes to a crawl, advanced package and integration techniques become increasingly crucial by allowing for the combination of fabricated silicon dies, so-called chiplet, to constitute system-in-package (SiP) achieving a much better yield and time-to-market. However, due to inherent security concerns within the convoluted semiconductor supply chain and in-field environment, hostile attacks targeting software and hardware applications can present a formidable challenge to ensuring the security of SiP. Even worse, the immanent black-box nature of product chiplets renders most conventional security inspection and testing solutions less useful. Therefore, we present our SiPGuard in this article to enable the security monitoring capability during run time to noninvasively track the application-level behaviors of target chiplets and detect any deviations potentially induced by underlying malicious intrusions. The security monitoring mechanism utilizes information-bearing system-level power noise variation and machine learning (ML) techniques. Specifically, we utilize a trusted field-programmable gate array (FPGA) chiplet as our trust anchor to implement the lightweight power sensor and on-chip ML inference engine for near-sensor analysis. We prototype our solution on a 2.5-D chiplet-based FPGA device and demonstrate the effectiveness against threats at software/hardware levels by identifying the consequent power anomalies of malicious activities.

AB Associating a novel situation with a specific outcome involves a cascade of cognitive processes, including selecting relevant stimuli, forming predictions regarding expected outcomes, and updating memorized predictions based on experience. The present manuscript uses computational modeling and machine learning to test the hypothesis that alpha-band (8-12 Hz) oscillations are involved in the updating of expectations based on experience. Participants learned that a visual cue predicted an aversive loud noise with a probability of 50%. The Rescorla-Wagner model of associative learning explained trial-wise changes in self-reported noise expectancy as well as alpha power changes. Experience in the past trial and self-reported expectancy for the subsequent trial were accurately decoded based on the topographical distribution of alpha power at specific latencies. Decodable information during initial association formation and contingency report recurred when viewing the conditioned cue. Findings support the idea that alpha oscillations have multiple, temporally specific, roles in the formation of associations between cues and outcomes.

AB MotivationMultiple sequence alignments (MSAs) of homologous sequences contain information on structural and functional constraints and their evolutionary histories. Despite their importance for many downstream tasks, such as structure prediction, MSA generation is often treated as a separate pre-processing step, without any guidance from the application it will be used for. ResultsHere, we implement a smooth and differentiable version of the Smith-Waterman pairwise alignment algorithm that enables jointly learning an MSA and a downstream machine learning system in an end-to-end fashion. To demonstrate its utility, we introduce SMURF (Smooth Markov Unaligned Random Field), a new method that jointly learns an alignment and the parameters of a Markov Random Field for unsupervised contact prediction. We find that SMURF learns MSAs that mildly improve contact prediction on a diverse set of protein and RNA families. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that by connecting our differentiable alignment module to AlphaFold2 and maximizing predicted confidence, we can learn MSAs that improve structure predictions over the initial MSAs. Interestingly, the alignments that improve AlphaFold predictions are self-inconsistent and can be viewed as adversarial. This work highlights the potential of differentiable dynamic programming to improve neural network pipelines that rely on an alignment and the potential dangers of optimizing predictions of protein sequences with methods that are not fully understood.Availability and implementationOur code and examples are available at: https://githuub.com/spetti/SMURF.

AB Natural products matter, for they are essential contributors to societal well-being and global health. Flavors, fragrances, essential oils, traditional medicines and phytopharmaceuticals, and prescription and over-the-counter products all utilize constituent materials from natural sources. However, these vast natural resources of Earth are disappearing, and climate change and market expansion by a dramatically increasing and ageing population will continue to strain plant sourcing in the decades ahead. It was with these and other considerations that the term "ecopharmacognosy" was developed as both a philosophy and a practice, and from which the necessity for a "medicines security" strategy evolved.
   Extending previous presentations, a series of sixty challenges for 2030 to the status quo promotes the discussion of a different vision for the natural product sciences as applied to traditional medicines. Among the topics presented are areas for global collaborative initiatives in science and in data management, the impact of climate change on medicinal plant accessibility, the sustainability and quality of the natural products that patients receive, and the integration of new technologies, particularly the genomics of secondary metabolite biosynthesis, hand-held detection systems and artificial intelligence, and the implications of increased life expectancy on future health care needs. The presentation closes with two examples of newer approaches in drug discovery.

AB This paper investigates a single machine serial-batching scheduling problem considering release times, setup time, and group scheduling, with the combined effects of deterioration and truncated job-dependent learning. The objective of the studied problem is to minimize the makespan. Firstly, we analyze the special case where all groups have the same arrival time, and propose the optimal structural properties on jobs sequencing, jobs batching, batches sequencing, and groups sequencing. Next, the corresponding batching rule and algorithm are developed. Based on these properties and the scheduling algorithm, we develop a hybrid VNS-ASHLO algorithm incorporating variable neighborhood search (VNS) and adaptive simplified human learning optimization (ASHLO) algorithms to solve the general case of the studied problem. Computational experiments on randomly generated instances are conducted to compare the proposed VNS-ASHLO with the algorithms of VNS, ASHLO, Simulated Annealing (SA), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The results based on instances of different scales show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

AB Objectives This study aimed to identify the risk factors for pancreatic cancer through machine learning.Methods We investigated the relationships between different risk factors and pancreatic cancer using a real-world retrospective cohort study conducted at West China Hospital of Sichuan University. Multivariable logistic regression, with pancreatic cancer as the outcome, was used to identify covariates associated with pancreatic cancer. The machine learning model extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) was adopted as the final model for its high performance. Shapley additive explanations (SHAPs) were utilized to visualize the relationships between these potential risk factors and pancreatic cancer.Results The cohort included 1,982 patients. The median ages for pancreatic cancer and nonpancreatic cancer groups were 58.1 years (IQR: 51.3-64.4) and 57.5 years (IQR: 49.5-64.9), respectively. Multivariable logistic regression indicated that kirsten rats arcomaviral oncogene homolog (KRAS) gene mutation, hyperlipidaemia, pancreatitis, and pancreatic cysts are significantly correlated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. The five most highly ranked features in the XGBoost model were KRAS gene mutation status, age, alcohol consumption status, pancreatitis status, and hyperlipidaemia status.Conclusion Machine learning algorithms confirmed that KRAS gene mutation, hyperlipidaemia, and pancreatitis are potential risk factors for pancreatic cancer. Additionally, the coexistence of KRAS gene mutation and pancreatitis, as well as KRAS gene mutation and pancreatic cysts, is associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer. Our findings offered valuable implications for public health strategies targeting the prevention and early detection of pancreatic cancer.

AB We consider the following video activity recognition (VAR) task: given a video, infer the set of activities being performed in the video and assign each frame to an activity. Although VAR can be solved accurately using existing deep learning techniques, deep networks are neither interpretable nor explainable and as a result their use is problematic in high stakes decision-making applications (in healthcare, experimental Biology, aviation, law, etc.). In such applications, failure may lead to disastrous consequences and therefore it is necessary that the user is able to either understand the inner workings of the model or probe it to understand its reasoning patterns for a given decision. We address these limitations of deep networks by proposing a new approach that feeds the output of a deep model into a tractable, interpretable probabilistic model called a dynamic conditional cutset network that is defined over the explanatory and output variables and then performing joint inference over the combined model. The two key benefits of using cutset networks are: (a) they explicitly model the relationship between the output and explanatory variables and as a result, the combined model is likely to be more accurate than the vanilla deep model and (b) they can answer reasoning queries in polynomial time and as a result, they can derive meaningful explanations by efficiently answering explanation queries. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on two datasets, Textually Annotated Cooking Scenes (TACoS), and wet lab, using conventional evaluation measures such as the Jaccard Index and Hamming Loss, as well as a human-subjects study.

AB Recently, the trending 5G technology encourages extensive applications of on-device machine learning, which collects user data for model training. This requires cost-effective techniques to preserve the privacy and the security of model training within the resource-constrained environment. Traditional learning methods rely on the trust among the system for privacy and security. However, with the increase of the learning scale, maintaining every edge device's trustworthiness could be expensive. To cost-effectively establish trust in a trustless environment, this paper proposes democratic learning (DemL), which makes the first step to explore hardware/software co-design for blockchain-secured decentralized on-device learning. By utilizing blockchain's decentralization and tamper-proofing, our design secures AI learning in a trustless environment. To tackle the extra overhead introduced by blockchain, we propose PoMC (an algorithm and architecture co-design) as a novel blockchain consensus mechanism, which first exploits cross-domain reuse (AI learning and blockchain consensus) in AI learning architecture. Evaluation results show our DemL can protect AI learning from privacy leakage and model pollution, and demonstrated that privacy and security come with trivial hardware overhead and power consumption (2%). We believe that our work will open the door of synergizing blockchain and on-device learning for security and privacy.

DE Damage assessment; Google street view; Deep learning; Remote sensing
ID SPATIAL VIDEO; RECOVERY; TORNADO
AB Assessing damage on the ground is a challenging task for humanitarian organizations and disaster managers due to the limited availability of data and methods for processing. As the most commonly adopted data source, remote sensing imagery can only reflect the damage situation on top of a building and fails to present the damage level from the perspective of the human eye. Recently, an increasing number of Google Street View (GSV) images provide the chance to understand the human's perception of damage on the ground. However, to automatically and quantitatively apply GSV images in damage assessment, two research questions need to be answered: (1) Can deep learning be successfully applied to automate the process of evaluating postdisaster damage using GSV images? (2) Does damage assessment using GSV images provide a different insight, compared with existing approaches, such as remote sensing imagery? Based on our experiments using GSV images and remote sensing imagery in Mexico Beach, FL after Hurricane Michael, we present two conclusions: (1) By applying a deep learning model, the GSV-based damage assessment can be satisfactorily and automatically conducted, with an accuracy of approximately 70% for a single GSV image. (2) GSV images provide a different insight into damage assessment since remote sensing imagery cannot record the damage to exterior walls, windows, doors and facades. When the overall damage level is relatively low, GSV images show better performance in damage assessment. Conversely, when the overall damage level is relatively high, remote sensing imagery shows better performance based our experiments.

AB As the industry grows, adulteration of many products by mislabelling, re-branding and false advertising is becoming prevalent practice. Existing solutions for analysis often require extensive sample preparation or are limited in terms of detecting different types of integrity issues. We describe a novel authentication method based on Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance (NQR) spectroscopy which is quantitative, non-invasive and non-destructive. It is sensitive to small deviation in the solid-state chemical structure of a product, which changes the NQR signal properties. These characteristics are unique for different manufacturers, resulting in manufacturer-specific watermarks. We show that nominally identical dietary supplements from different manufacturers can be accurately classified based on features from NQR spectra. Specifically, we use a machine learning-based classification called support vector machines (SVMs) to verify the authenticity of products under test. This approach has been evaluated on three products using semi-custom hardware and shows promising results, with typical classification accuracy of over 95%.

AB This paper concerns quasi-stochastic approximation (QSA) to solve root finding problems commonly found in applications to optimization and reinforcement learning. Theory is couched in a continuous time setting, in which parameter estimates are defined via the solution to a d-dimensional time-inhomogeneous ordinary differential equation dtd\Thetat =\alphaft(\Thetat). The conditions imposed imply that the time-varying vector field ft(\cdot ) is almost periodic, so that in particular the time average of ft(9) defines the time-homogeneous mean vector field f=\ : jd \rightarrow jd, and the goal then is to find the root 9* solving f=\(9*) = 0. The primary contribution on which other results are based is the perturbative mean flow representation: dtd\Thetat= \alpha(f=\ (\Thetat)- \alphar=\t+\alpha2Wt0+\alphadtdWt1+ d2 dt2Wt2) in which

AB Earthquakes pose substantial threats to communities worldwide. Understanding how people respond to the fast-changing environment during earthquakes is crucial for reducing risks and saving lives. This study aims to study people's protective action decision-making in earthquakes by leveraging explainable machine learning and video data. Specifically, this study first collected real-world CCTV footage and video postings from social media platforms, and then identified and annotated changes in the environment and people's behavioral responses during the M7.1 2018 Anchorage earthquake. By using the fully annotated video data, we applied XGBoost, a widely-used machine learning method, to model and forecast people's protective actions (e.g., drop and cover, hold on, and evacuate) during the earthquake. Then, explainable machine learning techniques were used to reveal the complex, nonlinear relationships between different factors and people's choices of protective actions. Modeling results confirm that social and environmental cues played critical roles in affecting the probability of different protective actions. Certain factors, such as the earthquake shaking intensity and number of people shown in the environment, displayed evident nonlinear relationships with the probability of choosing to evacuate. These findings can help emergency managers and policymakers design more effective protective action recommendations during earthquakes.

AB Attempts have been made to incorporate symbolic knowledge into neural networks, resulting in a class of networks known as knowledge-based neural networks. These constructions inherit the merits of both the knowledge-based and neural network approaches to the modeling of human intelligence, and yet the hybrid holds out a major promise of being more successful than its parents. The paper introduces three kinds of knowledge-based neural network. These are based on production rules, decision trees, and semantic constraints, respectively.

ID ACCRETION SHOCK INSTABILITY; SIMULATIONS; MODELS; EMISSION; RATES
AB Based on the prior O1-O2 observing runs, about 30% of the data collected by Advanced LIGO and Virgo in the next observing runs are expected to be single-interferometer data, i.e. they will be collected at times when only one detector in the network is operating in observing mode. Searches for gravitational-wave signals from supernova events do not rely on matched filtering techniques because of the stochastic nature of the signals. If a Galactic supernova occurs during single-interferometer times, separation of its unmodelled gravitational-wave signal from noise will be even more difficult due to lack of coherence between detectors. We present a novel machine learning method to perform single-interferometer supernova searches based on the standard LIGO-Virgo coherent WaveBurst pipeline. We show that the method may be used to discriminate Galactic gravitational-wave supernova signals from noise transients, decrease the false alarm rate of the search, and improve the supernova detection reach of the detectors.

AB The outcomes of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in decision-making related to in-person versus remote behavior-analytic service delivery. For those service providers who shifted from delivering in-person therapy to remote consultation, parents have presumably, at least at times, assumed a role similar to a registered behavior technician (RBT). We suggest that behavior analysts recommend two empirically based strategies to parents that they could incorporate into their daily lives during service disruptions: environmental enrichment and differential reinforcement of alternative behavior. We provide examples of naturally occurring contexts during which parents could integrate these procedures: (1) self-care or daily living activities, (2) physical activity, and (3) preferred learning activities. We support selecting these strategies and their application during exemplar contexts under the premise that they do not result in additional time expenditure, afford parents opportunities to complete essential (household, work-related, or personal) tasks, and still result in therapeutic gains.

AB An increasing number of neural memory networks have been developed, leading to the need for a systematic approach to analyze and compare their underlying memory structures. Thus, in this paper, we first create a framework for memory organization and then compare four popular dynamic models: vanilla recurrent neural network, long short-term memory, neural stack, and neural RAM. This analysis helps to open the dynamic neural networks' black box from the memory usage prospective. Accordingly, a taxonomy for these networks and their variants is proposed and proved using a unifying architecture. With the taxonomy, both network architectures and learning tasks are classified into four classes, and a one-to-one mapping is built between them to help practitioners select the appropriate architecture. To exemplify each task type, four synthetic tasks with different memory requirements are selected. Moreover, we use some signal processing applications and two natural language processing applications to evaluate the methodology in a realistic setting.

AB The study of bilingual aphasia has particular power to determine the neural basis of language function and can advance the treatment of aphasia. No theory of bilingual language has provided a coherent and comprehensive account for research results. I begin with a pre cis of a population encoding model of language function that assumes that representations are based upon the patterns of activity of large populations of neurons. I then consider how regularities in specific domains of language function (e.g. in semantics and phonologic sequence knowledge), frequency effects, and age of acquisition effects (strongest in lexical-semantics) might account for observed behavior in polyglots with aphasia. Finally, I review the literature on bilingual aphasia and its treatment to determine how well these hypotheses account for observed behavior. This analysis reveals that the population encoding theory can provide a coherent and granular account for this behavior.

AB We present the results of the first Machine Learning Gravitational-Wave Search Mock Data Challenge. For this challenge, participating groups had to identify gravitational-wave signals from binary black hole mergers of increasing complexity and duration embedded in progressively more realistic noise. The final of the 4 provided datasets contained real noise from the O3a observing run and signals up to a duration of 20 s with the inclusion of precession effects and higher order modes. We present the average sensitivity distance and run-time for the 6 entered algorithms derived from 1 month of test data unknown to the participants prior to submission. Of these, 4 are machine learning algorithms. We find that the best machine learning based algorithms are able to achieve up to 95% of the sensitive distance of matched-filtering based production analyses for simulated Gaussian noise at a false-alarm rate (FAR) of one per month. In contrast, for real noise, the leading machine learning search achieved 70%. For higher FARs the differences in sensitive distance shrink to the point where select machine learning submissions outperform traditional search algorithms at FARs >= 200 per month on some datasets. Our results show that current machine learning search algorithms may already be sensitive enough in limited parameter regions to be useful for some production settings. To improve the state-of-the-art, machine learning algorithms need to reduce the false-alarm rates at which they are capable of detecting signals and extend their validity to regions of parameter space where modeled searches are computationally expensive to run. Based on our findings we compile a list of research areas that we believe are the most important to elevate machine learning searches to an invaluable tool in gravitational-wave signal detection.

TI ResNet and CycleGAN for pulse shape discrimination of He-4 detector
   pulses: Recovering pulses conventional algorithms fail to label

AB Pulse shape discrimination (PSD) capable detectors, such as He-4, that respond to neutron and gamma-ray interactions have a threshold deposited energy value below which n/gamma discrimination vanishes when using conventional PSD algorithms. Recent attempts in applying supervised learning based artificial neural networks for PSD use the pulses in the separated regions to train the networks so they can be used to classify another set of separated pulses. In doing so, pulses previously indistinguishable are not recovered for classification, which would have increased the number of neutron and gamma-ray pulses that could be used for further analysis. Assuming the reason why conventional PSD algorithms have unseparated regions is because the parameter space of the algorithms fail to capture the intrinsic (but subtle) distinguishing behavior of some of the neutron and gamma-ray pulses, a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (CycleGAN) was trained to amplify those differences and extract well separated neutron and gamma-ray clusters. Results show that, once the network is trained with pulses from separated and unseparated regions, it was able to transform the pulses in the unseparated region to improve the PSD. Subsequent n/gamma classification was performed using deep residual network (ResNet) that takes pulses with 512 data points as an input. Two different ResNets were explored - simple ResNet and modified ResNet which takes segmented pulse inputs in the first layer and the corresponding time axis values in the last hidden layer. The later approach enables the network to extract time correlated pulse features to enhance its ability to capture the pulse behaviors relevant for PSD. Although it achieves slightly lower accuracy, 99.41% versus 99.89%, based on simply counting the number of correct n/gamma labels assigned, compared to the simple ResNet, the modified ResNets architecture was able to decreases the cross-entropy loss function by half, which implies that the correct n/gamma labels assigned are less likely to be accidental. PSD parameter distributions based on n/gamma classification by ResNet before and after transforming unseparated pulses using CycleGAN show that by enhancing the separation between neutrons and gamma-rays, the transformation helps improve the performance of classifier networks that are trained using labeled dataset. The enhancement of neutron and gamma-ray separation by the CycleGAN increased the PSD figure of merit (FOM) by up to 70% in some regions. The results show that, if a given detector achieves clear separation between neutron and gamma-ray pulses in any energy region, such neural network approaches can help lower the energy threshold for the separation and increasing the number of neutron and gamma-ray pulses that can be used for further analysis.

AB Studies on neural plasticity associated with brain-machine interface (BMI) exposure have primarily documented changes in single neuron activity, and largely in intact subjects. Here, we demonstrate significant changes in ensemble-level functional connectivity among primary motor cortical (MI) neurons of chronically amputated monkeys exposed to control a multiple-degree-of-freedom robot arm. A multi-electrode array was implanted in M1 contralateral or ipsilateral to the amputation in three animals. Two clusters of stably recorded neurons were arbitrarily assigned to control reach and grasp movements, respectively. With exposure, network density increased in a nearly monotonic fashion in the contralateral monkeys, whereas the ipsilateral monkey pruned the existing network before re-forming a denser connectivity. Excitatory connections among neurons within a cluster were denser, whereas inhibitory connections were denser among neurons across the two clusters. These results indicate that cortical network connectivity can be modified with BMI learning, even among neurons that have been chronically de-efferented and de-afferented due to amputation.

AB The authors used data from a large, national sample to examine the interaction of various literacy measures among young children with disabilities. Using structural equation modeling, they examined the relationships among measures of phonemic awareness, decoding, vocabulary, and reading comprehension. Child and family factors, including sex, severity of disability, race/ethnicity, household income, and mother's education were used as covariates. The model supported the notion of 2 unique paths to reading comprehension, one through decoding and a second through vocabulary.

AB Curb spaces are important assets to cities. They are often used by travelers to switch transportation means, visitors to access curbside properties, and municipalities to place roadside infrastructure. The promotion of multi-modal transportation and the emergence of new mobility services have complicated both curb environ-ments and their management. Consequently, some cities have started to explore new strategies for curb man-agement, but lacked the anticipation on how different curb regulations and built-environment features may collectively influence curb-use patterns across user groups. We make a step toward smart curb environment by proposing a graph-based deep learning approach, i.e., MultiGCN-LSTM, to predict diverse curb uses across time and space. We used two graph convolution layers and an LSTM layer to capture the spatial, temporal, and se-mantic dependencies between curb regulations, built-environment semantics, and diverse curb uses. Two place -specific models were developed separately for a medium-sized college town and a metropolitan in the U.S. The effectiveness of the proposed models was validated with ablation studies and demonstrated in three scenario experiments. The research contributes to smart curb management in the face of more diversified and intensified curb uses with new mobility services and emerging vehicular technologies.

   INFERENCE; NETWORKS; SYSTEMS
AB Although species are central units for biological research, recent findings in genomics are raising awareness that what we call species can be ill-founded entities due to solely morphology-based, regional species descriptions. This particularly applies to groups characterized by intricate evolutionary processes such as hybridization, polyploidy, or asexuality. Here, challenges of current integrative taxonomy (genetics/genomics + morphology + ecology, etc.) become apparent: different vored species concepts, lack of universal characters/markers, missing appropriate analytical tools for intricate evolutionary processes, and highly subjective ranking and fusion of datasets. Now, integrative taxonomy combined with artificial intelligence under a unified species concept can enable automated feature learning and data integration, and thus reduce subjectivity in species delimitation. This proach will likely accelerate revising and unraveling eukaryotic biodiversity.

AB Rats with bilateral lesions of the ventral striatal nucleus accumbens failed to acquire Pavlovian second-order conditioning to auditory stimuli paired with visual stimuli that had previously received first-order pairings with food. This deficit in second-order conditioning was specific to learning driven by incentive properties of the first-order cues, and was observed whether the first-order training had occurred prior to or after lesion surgery. Lesions also produced deficits in the display of conditioned responses to the first-order conditioned stimulus, but only when they were made after first-order training. These results suggest a specific role for the ventral striatum in acquiring and expressing incentive properties of conditioned stimuli through second-order conditioning, as well as a more general role in expressing previously acquired Pavlovian conditioned responses.

AB Objective To evaluate the reliability of three artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots (ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Chatsonic) in generating accurate references from existing obstetric literature. Study Design Between mid-March and late April 2023, ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Chatsonic were prompted to provide references for specific obstetrical randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in 2020. RCTs were considered for inclusion if they were mentioned in a previous article that primarily evaluated RCTs published by the top medical and obstetrics and gynecology journals with the highest impact factors in 2020 as well as RCTs published in a new journal focused on publishing obstetric RCTs. The selection of the three AI models was based on their popularity, performance in natural language processing, and public availability. Data collection involved prompting the AI chatbots to provide references according to a standardized protocol. The primary evaluation metric was the accuracy of each AI model in correctly citing references, including authors, publication title, journal name, and digital object identifier (DOI). Statistical analysis was performed using a permutation test to compare the performance of the AI models. Results Among the 44 RCTs analyzed, Google Bard demonstrated the highest accuracy, correctly citing 13.6% of the requested RCTs, whereas ChatGPT and Chatsonic exhibited lower accuracy rates of 2.4 and 0%, respectively. Google Bard often substantially outperformed Chatsonic and ChatGPT in correctly citing the studied reference components. The majority of references from all AI models studied were noted to provide DOIs for unrelated studies or DOIs that do not exist. Conclusion To ensure the reliability of scientific information being disseminated, authors must exercise caution when utilizing AI for scientific writing and literature search. However, despite their limitations, collaborative partnerships between AI systems and researchers have the potential to drive synergistic advancements, leading to improved patient care and outcomes.

AB The production of electronic waste, also known as e-waste, has risen with the growing reliance on electronic products. To reduce negative environmental impact and achieve sustainable industrial processes, recovering and reusing products is crucial. Advances in AI and robotics can help in this effort by reducing workload for human workers and allowing them to stay away from hazardous materials. However, autonomous human motion/ intention perception is a primary barrier in e-waste remanufacturing. To address the research gap, this study combined experimental data collection with deep learning models for accurate disassembly task recognition. Over 570,000 frames of motion data were collected from inertial measurement units (IMU) worn by 22 participants. A novel sequence-based correction (SBC) algorithm was also proposed to further improve the accuracy of the overall pipeline. Results showed that models (CNN, LSTM, and GoogLeNet) had an overall accuracy of 88-92%. The proposed SBC algorithm improved accuracy to 95%.

AB Recent years have witnessed significant progress in understanding how memories are encoded, from the molecular to the cellular and the circuit/systems levels. With a good compromise between brain complexity and behavioral sophistication, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is one of the preeminent animal models of learning and memory. Here we review how memories are encoded in Drosophila, with a focus on short-term memory and an eye toward future directions. Forward genetic screens have revealed a large number of genes and transcripts necessary for learning and memory, some acting cell-autonomously. Further, the relative numerical simplicity of the fly brain has enabled the reverse engineering of learning circuits with remarkable precision, in some cases ascribing behavioral phenotypes to single neurons. Functional imaging and physiological studies have localized and parsed the plasticity that occurs during learning at some of the major loci. Connectomics projects are significantly expanding anatomical knowledge of the nervous system, filling out the roadmap for ongoing functional/physiological and behavioral studies, which are being accelerated by simultaneous tool development. These developments have provided unprecedented insight into the fundamental neural principles of learning, and lay the groundwork for deep understanding in the near future.

AB In this paper we develop the gamma neural model, a new neural net architecture for processing of temporal patterns. Time varying patterns are normally segmented into a sequence of static patterns that are successively presented to a neural net. In the approach presented here segmentation is avoided. Only current signal values are presented to the neural net, which adapts its own internal memory to store the past. Thus, in the gamma neural net, an adaptive short term mechanism obviates a priori signal segmentation. We evaluate the relation between the gamma net and competing dynamic neural models. Interestingly, the gamma model brings many popular dynamic net architectures, such as the time-delay-neural-net and the concentration-in-time-neural-net, into a unifying framework. In fact, the gamma memory structure appears as general as a temporal convolution memory structure with arbitrary time varying weight kernel w(t). Yet, the gamma model remains mathematically equivalent to the additive (Grossberg) model with constant weights. We present a back propagation procedure to adapt the weights in a particular feedforward structure, the focused gamma net.

AB Federated learning (FL) allows multiple parties (distributed devices) to train a machine learning model without sharing raw data. How to effectively and efficiently utilize the resources on devices and the central server is a highly interesting yet challenging problem. In this article, we propose an efficient split FL (ESFL) algorithm to take full advantage of the powerful computing capabilities at a central server under a split FL framework with heterogeneous end devices (EDs). By splitting the model into different submodels between the server and EDs, our approach jointly optimizes user-side workload and server-side computing resource allocation by considering users' heterogeneity. We formulate the whole optimization problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear program, which is an NP-hard problem, and develop an iterative approach to obtain an approximate solution efficiently. Extensive simulations have been conducted to validate the significantly increased efficiency of our ESFL approach compared with standard FL, split learning, and splitfed learning.

AB The support vector machine (SVM) is a popular classifier in machine learning, but it is not robust to outliers. In this paper, based on the Correntropy induced loss function, we propose the resealed hinge loss function which is a monotonic, bounded and nonconvex loss that is robust to outliers. We further show that the hinge loss is a special case of the proposed resealed hinge loss. Then, we develop a new robust SVM based on the resealed hinge loss. After using the half-quadratic optimization method, we find that the new robust SVM is equivalent to an iterative weighted SVM, which can help explain the robustness of iterative weighted SVM from a loss function perspective. Experimental results confirm that the new robust SVM not only performs better than SVM and the existing robust SVMs on the datasets that have outliers, but also presents better sparseness than SVM.

ID LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; POSTOPERATIVE PAIN; AGREEMENT; NETWORKS
AB Objective. We report on a classification approach using machine learning (ML) algorithms for prediction of postoperative femoral nerve block (FNB) requirement following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.
   Background. FNBs are commonly performed for ACL reconstruction to control postoperative pain. Ideally, anesthesiologists would target preoperative FNB only to ACL reconstruction patients expected to experience severe postoperative pain. Perioperative factors associated with postoperative FNB placement following ACL reconstruction remain unclear, may differ among separate surgical facilities, and render such predictions difficult.
   Methods. We conducted a chart review of 349 patients who underwent ACL reconstruction at a single outpatient surgical facility. Standard perioperative data commonly available during routine preoperative examination were recorded. ML classifiers based on logistic regression, BayesNet, multilayer perceptron, support vector machine, and alternating decision tree (ADTree) algorithms were then developed to predict which patients would require postoperative FNB.
   Results. Each of the ML algorithms outperformed traditional logistic regression using a very limited data set as measured by the area under the receiver operating curve, with ADTree achieving the highest score of 0.7 in the cross-validated sample. Logistic regression outperformed all other classifiers with regard to kappa statistics and percent correctly classified. All models were prone to overfitting in comparisons of training vs cross-validated samples.
   Conclusion. ML classifiers may offer improved predictive capabilities when analyzing medical data sets compared with traditional statistical methodologies in predicting severe postoperative pain requiring peripheral nerve block.

AB Objective The objective of this study is to develop a deep learning pipeline to detect signals on dietary supplement-related adverse events (DS AEs) from Twitter. Materials and Methods We obtained 247 807 tweets ranging from 2012 to 2018 that mentioned both DS and AE. We designed a tailor-made annotation guideline for DS AEs and annotated biomedical entities and relations on 2000 tweets. For the concept extraction task, we fine-tuned and compared the performance of BioClinical-BERT, PubMedBERT, ELECTRA, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa models with a CRF classifier. For the relation extraction task, we fine-tuned and compared BERT models to BioClinical-BERT, PubMedBERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa models. We chose the best-performing models in each task to assemble an end-to-end deep learning pipeline to detect DS AE signals and compared the results to the known DS AEs from a DS knowledge base (ie, iDISK). Results DeBERTa-CRF model outperformed other models in the concept extraction task, scoring a lenient microaveraged F1 score of 0.866. RoBERTa model outperformed other models in the relation extraction task, scoring a lenient microaveraged F1 score of 0.788. The end-to-end pipeline built on these 2 models was able to extract DS indication and DS AEs with a lenient microaveraged F1 score of 0.666. Conclusion We have developed a deep learning pipeline that can detect DS AE signals from Twitter. We have found DS AEs that were not recorded in an existing knowledge base (iDISK) and our proposed pipeline can as sist DS AE pharmacovigilance.

AB Occupational health and safety (OHS) is of the utmost concern in the construction sector. For decades, researchers and practitioners have endeavoured to enhance construction OHS performance through various measures ranging from "hard" technologies (in this paper, the "first wave" of construction OHS management) such as provision of personal protective equipment, to the more recent "soft", managerial approaches (the "second wave") such as fostering a safety culture. Although considerable improvements have been made in construction OHS, the general sentiment is that construction remains one of the most dangerous sectors, warranting more innovative or even revolutionary approaches. This research seeks to develop a smart construction object (SCO)-enabled OHS management system. The central tenet of the system is that artificial intelligence (AI), as the art of creating machines that perform functions that require intelligence when performed by people, represents a direction of the "third wave" in construction OHS management. The system embraces emergent SCOs and harnesses the power of their smart properties of awareness, communicativeness, and autonomy. The system is demonstrated and validated in real-life construction practice and a controlled lab test with a tower crane, the cause of many construction-related injuries and fatalities, as the subject. It is found that the SCO-enabled OHS management system can identify dangerous situations and respond to them autonomously. This research suggests that smarter construction, through incorporation of AI in particular, is a direction of much promise in terms of improving construction OHS.

AB Data on the likelihood of becoming a professional athlete are abundant and readily available, yet athletes consistently overestimate their chances of achieving the top levels of career success. Research is needed to examine whether athletes and others update their career expectations when seeing new information. In this study, minor league baseball players created a career tree estimating their probabilities of moving through the minor league system and then read personalized trees built by a C5.0 machine learning algorithm. After seeing the C5.0 trees, many players updated their expectations consistent with updating theory, especially when reevaluating their chances of being out of the system; however, there was evidence of asymmetric updating. Some acted opposite to what Bayesian reasoning would suggest. Analysis of the interview data reveals three themes that explain asymmetric and contrary updating. Players believed optimism is necessary for their baseball career, they neglected their reference group, and they saw information as possessing affective qualities. Using these three themes caused athletes to ignore some information and, occasionally, circumvent the updating process altogether.

AB A remote sensing technique was developed to detect citrus canker in laboratory conditions and was verified in the grove by utilizing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). In the laboratory, a hyperspectral (400-1000 nm) imaging system was utilized for the detection of citrus canker in several disease development stages (i.e., asymptomatic, early, and late symptoms) on Sugar Belle leaves and immature (green) fruit by using two classification methods: (i) radial basis function (RBF) and (ii) K nearest neighbor (KNN). The same imaging system mounted on an UAV was used to detect citrus canker on tree canopies in the orchard. The overall classification accuracy of the RBF was higher (94%, 96%, and 100%) than the KNN method (94%, 95%, and 96%) for detecting canker in leaves. Among the 31 studied vegetation indices, the water index (WI) and the Modified Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index (ARI and TCARI 1) more accurately detected canker in laboratory and in orchard conditions, respectively. Immature fruit was not a reliable tissue for early detection of canker. However, the proposed technique successfully distinguished the late stage canker-infected fruit with 92% classification accuracy. The UAV-based technique achieved 100% classification accuracy for identifying healthy and canker-infected trees.

ID COMBINATORIAL OPTIMIZATION
AB Selecting a set of initial users from a social network in order to maximize the envisaged number of influenced users is known as influence maximization (IM). Researchers have achieved significant advancements in the theoretical design and performance gain of several classical approaches, but these advances are almost reaching their pinnacle. Learning-based IM approaches have emerged recently with a higher generalization to unknown graphs than conventional methods. The development of learning-based IM methods is still constrained by a number of fundamental hardships, including (1) solving the objective function efficiently, (2) struggling to characterize the diverse underlying diffusion patterns, and (3) adapting the solution to different node- centrality-constrained IM variants. To address the aforementioned issues, we design a novel framework DeepIM for generatively characterizing the latent representation of seed sets, as well as learning the diversified information diffusion pattern in a data-driven and end-to-end way. Subsequently, we design a novel objective function to infer optimal seed sets under flexible node-centrality-based budget constraints. Extensive analyses are conducted over both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the overall performance of DeepIM.

AB Frequent spontaneous facial self-touches, predominantly during outbreaks, have the theoretical potential to be a mechanism of contracting and transmitting diseases. Despite the recent advent of vaccines, behavioral approaches remain an integral part of reducing the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses. The aim of this study was to utilize the functionality and the spread of smartwatches to develop a smartwatch application to identify motion signatures that are mapped accurately to face touching. Participants (n = 10, five women, aged 20-83) performed 10 physical activities classified into face touching (FT) and non-face touching (NFT) categories in a standardized laboratory setting. We developed a smartwatch application on Samsung Galaxy Watch to collect raw accelerometer data from participants. Data features were extracted from consecutive non-overlapping windows varying from 2 to 16 s. We examined the performance of state-of-the-art machine learning methods on face-touching movement recognition (FT vs. NFT) and individual activity recognition (IAR): logistic regression, support vector machine, decision trees, and random forest. While all machine learning models were accurate in recognizing FT categories, logistic regression achieved the best performance across all metrics (accuracy: 0.93 & PLUSMN; 0.08, recall: 0.89 & PLUSMN; 0.16, precision: 0.93 & PLUSMN; 0.08, F1-score: 0.90 & PLUSMN; 0.11, AUC: 0.95 & PLUSMN; 0.07) at the window size of 5 s. IAR models resulted in lower performance, where the random forest classifier achieved the best performance across all metrics (accuracy: 0.70 & PLUSMN; 0.14, recall: 0.70 & PLUSMN; 0.14, precision: 0.70 & PLUSMN; 0.16, F1-score: 0.67 & PLUSMN; 0.15) at the window size of 9 s. In conclusion, wearable devices, powered by machine learning, are effective in detecting facial touches. This is highly significant during respiratory infection outbreaks as it has the potential to limit face touching as a transmission vector.

AB With rapid urbanization and industrialization, the number of light-duty gasoline vehicles (LDGVs) in China has continued to grow rapidly, leading to a significant increase in traffic pollution. Therefore, it is essential to accurately calculate the emission of LDGVs for air quality monitoring and management. Fortunately, Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES) is a sophisticated model for estimating mobile source emissions with good prediction accuracy. However, the parameters of MOVES are based on the field tests in the US, which is worth exploring whether MOVES can be applied to other countries. Hence, in this paper, we used the portable emission measurement system (PEMS) to conduct real driving emission (RDE) tests of LDGVs, aiming to explore the possibility of the MOVES application in China. Based on the field tests, we modified basic parameters in the MOVES model, but unsatisfactory prediction performance was obtained. Existing research on improving MOVES performance mainly involved new binning of operating modes, but these methods had limited improvements. Though studies have also used machine learning methods for predicting LDGV emissions, they lacked comparison and integration with the MOVES model. To further improve the prediction accuracy, we proposed a novel road vehicle emission model that integrated the machine learning method and the MOVES to predict the road-level emission rates of NO and CO2 emissions of LDGVs. In addition, we employed the Boruta algorithm to capture the key influencing factors and promote prediction performance. The enhanced model outperformed MOVES and achieved higher R-2 values. On average, the improvement for CO2 was 0.132, and for NO, it was 0.261. This work will provide references for MOVES improvements in practical scenarios and better predict pollutant emissions for LDGVs using limited resources of field tests in cities outside the US.

AB BACKGROUND:Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) remain a challenging neurological diagnosis associated with significant morbidity and mortality. There is a plethora of microsurgical and endovascular techniques for the treatment of both ruptured and unruptured aneurysms. There is no definitive consensus as to the best treatment option for this cerebrovascular pathology. The Aneurysm, Arteriovenous Malformation, and Chronic Subdural Hematoma Roundtable Discussion With Industry and Stroke Experts discussed best practices and the most promising approaches to improve the management of brain aneurysms.METHODS:A group of experts from academia, industry, and federal regulators convened to discuss updated clinical trials, scientific research on preclinical system models, management options, screening and monitoring, and promising novel device technologies, aiming to improve the outcomes of patients with IA.RESULTS:Aneurysm, Arteriovenous Malformation, and Chronic Subdural Hematoma Roundtable Discussion With Industry and Stroke Experts suggested the incorporation of artificial intelligence to capture sequential aneurysm growth, identify predictors of rupture, and predict the risk of rupture to guide treatment options. The consensus strongly recommended nationwide systemic data collection of unruptured IA radiographic images for the analysis and development of machine learning algorithms for rupture risk. The consensus supported centers of excellence for preclinical multicenter trials in areas such as genetics, cellular composition, and radiogenomics. Optical coherence tomography and magnetic resonance imaging contrast-enhanced 3T vessel wall imaging are promising technologies; however, more data are needed to define their role in IA management. Ruptured aneurysms are best managed at large volume centers, which should include comprehensive patient management with expertise in microsurgery, endovascular surgery, neurology, and neurocritical care.CONCLUSIONS:Clinical and preclinical studies and scientific research on IA should engage high-volume centers and be conducted in multicenter collaborative efforts. The future of IA diagnosis and monitoring could be enhanced by the incorporation of artificial intelligence and national radiographic and biologic registries. A collaborative effort between academic centers, government regulators, and the device industry is paramount for the adequate management of IA and the advancement of the field.

AB Background: Childhood Sjogren's disease is a rare, underdiagnosed, and poorly-understood condition. By integrating machine learning models on a paediatric cohort in the USA, we aimed to develop a novel system (the Florida Scoring System) for stratifying symptomatic paediatric patients with suspected Sjogren's disease. Methods: This cross-sectional study was done in symptomatic patients who visited the Department of Pediatric Rheumatology at the University of Florida, FL, USA. Eligible patients were younger than 18 years or had symptom onset before 18 years of age. Patients with confirmed diagnosis of another autoimmune condition or infection with a clear aetiological microorganism were excluded. Eligible patients underwent comprehensive examinations to rule out or diagnose childhood Sjogren's disease. We used latent class analysis with clinical and laboratory variables to detect heterogeneous patient classes. Machine learning models, including random forest, gradient-boosted decision tree, partial least square discriminatory analysis, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-penalised ordinal regression, artificial neural network, and super learner were used to predict patient classes and rank the importance of variables. Causal graph learning selected key features to build the final Florida Scoring System. The predictors for all models were the clinical and laboratory variables and the outcome was the definition of patient classes. Findings: Between Jan 16, 2018, and April 28, 2022, we screened 448 patients for inclusion. After excluding 205 patients due to symptom onset later than 18 years of age, we recruited 243 patients into our cohort. 26 patients were excluded because of confirmed diagnosis of a disorder other than Sj & ouml;gren's disease, and 217 patients were included in the final analysis. Median age at diagnosis was 15 years (IQR 11-17). 155 (72%) of 216 patients were female and 61 (28%) were male, 167 (79%) of 212 were White, and 20 (9%) of 213 were Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish. The latent class analysis identified three distinct patient classes: class I (dryness dominant with positive tests, n=27), class II (high symptoms with negative tests, n=98), and class III (low symptoms with negative tests, n=92). Machine learning models accurately predicted patient class and ranked variable importance consistently. The causal graphical model discovered key features for constructing the Florida Scoring System. Interpretation: The Florida Scoring System is a paediatrician-friendly tool that can be used to assist classification and long-term monitoring of suspected childhood Sjogren's disease. The resulting stratification has important implications for clinical management, trial design, and pathobiological research. We found a highly symptomatic patient group with negative serology and diagnostic profiles, which warrants clinical attention. We further revealed that salivary gland ultrasonography can be a non-invasive alternative to minor salivary gland biopsy in children. The Florida Scoring System requires validation in larger prospective paediatric cohorts.

AB Smart Grid (SG) research and development has drawn much attention from academia, industry and government due to the great impact it will have on society, economics and the environment. Securing the SG is a considerably significant challenge due the increased dependency on communication networks to assist in physical process control, exposing them to various cyber-threats. In addition to attacks that change measurement values using False Data Injection (FDI) techniques, attacks on the communication network may disrupt the power system's real-time operation by intercepting messages, or by flooding the communication channels with unnecessary data. Addressing these attacks requires a cross-layer approach. In this paper a cross-layered strategy is presented, called Cross-Layer Ensemble CorrDet with Adaptive Statistics(CECD-AS), which integrates the detection of faulty SG measurement data as well as inconsistent network inter-arrival times and transmission delays for more reliable and accurate anomaly detection and attack interpretation. Numerical results show that CECD-AS can detect multiple False Data Injections, Denial of Service (DoS) and Man In The Middle (MITM) attacks with a high F1-score compared to current approaches that only use SG measurement data for detection such as the traditional physics-based State Estimation, ECD-AS strategy and other machine learning classification-based detection schemes.

AB To better understand encoding and decoding of stimulus information in two specific hippocampal sub-regions, we isolated and co-cultured rat primary dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 neurons within a two-chamber device with axonal connectivity via micro-tunnels. We tested the hypothesis that, in these engineered networks, decoding performance of stimulus site information would be more accurate when stimuli and information flow occur in anatomically correct feed-forward DG to CA3 vs. CA3 back to DG. In particular, we characterized the neural code of these sub-regions by measuring sparseness and uniqueness of the responses evoked by specific paired-pulse stimuli. We used the evoked responses in CA3 to decode the stimulation sites in DG (and vice-versa) by means of learning algorithms for classification (support vector machine, SVM). The device was placed over an 8 x 8 grid of extracellular electrodes (micro-electrode array, MEA) in order to provide a platform for monitoring development, self-organization, and improved access to stimulation and recording at multiple sites. The micro-tunnels were designed with dimensions 3 x 10 x 400 mu m allowing axonal growth but not migration of cell bodies and long enough to exclude traversal by dendrites. Paired-pulse stimulation (inter-pulse interval 50 ms) was applied at 22 different sites and repeated 25 times in each chamber for each sub-region to evoke time-locked activity. DG-DG and CA3-CA3 networks were used as controls. Stimulation in DG drove signals through the axons in the tunnels to activate a relatively small set of specific electrodes in CA3 (sparse code). CA3CA3 and DG-DG controls were less sparse in coding than CA3 in DG-CA3 networks. Using all target electrodes with the three highest spike rates (14%), the evoked responses in CA3 specified each stimulation site in DG with optimum uniqueness of 64%. Finally, by SVM learning, these evoked responses in CA3 correctly decoded the stimulation sites in DG for 43% of the trials, significantly higher than the reverse, i. e., how well-recording in DG could predict the stimulation site in CA3. In conclusion, our co-cultured model for the in vivo DG-CA3 hippocampal network showed sparse and specific responses in CA3, selectively evoked by each stimulation site in DG.

AB The uniform application (UA) of agrochemicals results in the over-application of harmful chemicals, increases crop input costs, and deteriorates the environment when compared with variable rate application (VA). A smart variable rate sprayer (SVRS) was designed, developed, and tested using deep learning (DL) for VA application of agrochemicals. Real-time testing of the SVRS took place for detecting and spraying and/or skipping lambsquarters weed and early blight infected and healthy potato plants. About 24,000 images were collected from potato fields in Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick under varying sunny, cloudy, and partly cloudy conditions and processed/trained using YOLOv3 and tiny-YOLOv3 models. Due to faster performance, the tiny-YOLOv3 was chosen to deploy in SVRS. A laboratory experiment was designed under factorial arrangements, where the two spraying techniques (UA and VA) and the three weather conditions (cloudy, partly cloudy, and sunny) were the two independent variables with spray volume consumption as a response variable. The experimental treatments had six repetitions in a 2 x 3 factorial design. Results of the two-way ANOVA showed a significant effect of spraying application techniques on volume consumption of spraying liquid (p-value < 0.05). There was no significant effect of weather conditions and interactions between the two independent variables on volume consumption during weeds and simulated diseased plant detection experiments (p-value > 0.05). The SVRS was able to save 42 and 43% spraying liquid during weeds and simulated diseased plant detection experiments, respectively. Water sensitive papers' analysis showed the applicability of SVRS for VA with >40% savings of spraying liquid by SVRS when compared with UA. Field applications of this technique would reduce the crop input costs and the environmental risks in conditions (weed and disease) like experimental testing.

DE capstone course; GPT; LLM; scoring
AB Grading is one of the most relevant hurdles for instructors, diverting instructor's focus on the development of engaging learning activities, class preparation, and attending to students' questions. Institutions and instructors are continuously looking for alternatives to reduce educators' time required on grading, frequently, resulting in hiring teaching assistants whose inexperience and frequent rotation can lead to inconsistent and subjective evaluations. Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 may alleviate grading challenges; however, research in this field is limited when dealing with assignments requiring specialized knowledge, complex critical thinking, subjective, and creative. This research investigates whether GPT-4's scores correlate with human grading in a construction capstone project and how the use of criteria and rubrics in GPT influences this correlation. Projects were graded by two human graders and three training configurations in GPT-4: no detailed criteria, paraphrased criteria, and explicit rubrics. Each configuration was tested through 10 iterations to evaluate GPT consistency. Results challenge GPT-4's potential to grade argumentative assignments. GPT-4's score correlates slightly better (although poor overall) with human evaluations when no additional information is provided, underscoring the poor impact of the specificity of training materials for GPT scoring in this type of assignment. Despite the LLMs' promises, their limitations include variability in consistency and reliance on statistical pattern analysis, which can lead to misleading evaluations along with privacy concerns when handling sensitive student data. Educators must carefully design grading guidelines to harness the full potential of LLMs in academic assessments, balancing AI's efficiency with the need for nuanced human judgment.

AB Estuarine water salinity is important to coastal ecosystems and the economy. To examine the potential effect of the Mississippi River freshwater discharge on water salinity of other estuaries, we used the machine learning Cubist algorithm to model salinity of three estuaries (Apalachicola Bay, Weeks Bay, and Grand Bay) of the northern Gulf of Mexico (GoM). The models were trained - both with and without the Mississippi River discharge as input - to examine its effect on the salinity of other estuaries along with other variables including wind, discharge, and water depth. By including the Mississippi discharge, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of the model training sets decreased by 0.81, 1.06 and 1.73 for the Apalachicola Bay, Weeks Bay, and Grand Bay, respectively, while the decrease of the model testing sets was 0.20, 0.64, and 0.84, respectively, using the practical salinity scale. The rank of predictor importance of the Mississippi discharge increased as the modeled estuary proximity increased to the Mississippi outlet. The results showed that the Mississippi River discharge can affect the water quality of other estuaries along the northern GoM, although the variation of the salinity explained by this flow was smaller than that explained by local river flow (except for the Grand Bay where there is no local river flow) and local wind.

AB Short-term demand forecasting for on-demand ride-hailing services is a fundamental issue in intelligent transportation systems. However, previous research predominantly focused on improving prediction accuracy, ignoring fairness issues such as systematic underestimations of travel demand in disadvantaged neighborhoods. This study investigates how to measure, evaluate, and enhance prediction fairness between disadvantaged and privileged communities in spatial-temporal demand forecasting of ride-hailing services. We developed a socially-aware neural network (SA-Net) that integrates socio-demographics and ridership information for fair demand prediction, and introduced a bias-mitigation regularization to reduce the prediction error gap between black and non-black, and low-income and high-income communities. The experimental results, using Chicago Transportation Network Company (TNC) data, demonstrate that our de-biasing SA-Net model outperforms other models in both prediction accuracy and fairness. Notably, the SA-Net exhibits a significant improvement in prediction accuracy, reducing 2.3% in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) compared to state-of-the-art models. When coupled with the bias-mitigation regularization, the de-biasing SA-Net effectively bridges the mean percentage prediction error (MPE) gap between the disadvantaged and privileged groups, and protects the disadvantaged regions against systematic underestimation of TNC demand. Specifically, our approach reduces the MPE gap between black and non-black communities by 67% without compromising overall prediction accuracy.

AB This research aimed to use a computational approach to aid infection prevention strategies during the predesign phase of healthcare environment planning. The objective of this study was to decompose and analyze health system catchment area 'outside design basis factors' such as demographic, public health, and environmental characteristics that may contribute to infection causing pathogen spread in healthcare environments using state of Florida data as a context for analysis. Supervised Machine Learning methodologies were used to determine relationships between Socioecological System (SES) factors and observed incidence rates of specific Hospital Acquired Infections (HAI). Results of the analysis suggest that relevant regional population SES factors, when included as independent variables, can forecast the potential co-occurrence of specific types of HAI in regional health system service areas. Outcomes of the analysis suggest that demographic and regional characteristics are significantly related to the predictive incidence of Antimicrobial-resistant infections in healthcare settings in Florida Agency for Healthcare Administration (ACHA) regions. The outcomes of this research suggest the benefit of using SES computational modeling for decision-making in health system Architectural Programming and predesign. This process allows for manifesting meaningful patterns by applying quantitative methods to analyze patient population characteristics that may influence the prevalence of pathogen spread within the interior environments of healthcare inpatient settings. This information contributes to a deeper understanding of context-specific priorities for operationalizing human-centered Infection Prevention through Design (PtD) infrastructure and planning.

AB The identification of electromagnetic emission from gravitational-wave sources typically requires multiple follow-up observations due to the limited fields of view of follow-up observatories compared to the poorly localized direction of gravitational waves. Gravitational-wave localization regions are typically covered with multiple telescope pointings using a "honeycomb" structure, which is optimal only on an infinite, flat surface. Here we present a machine-learning algorithm which uses genetic algorithms along with Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno optimization to find an optimal configuration of tiles to cover the gravitational-wave sky localization area on a spherical surface.

AB The astounding development of optical sensing imaging technology, coupled with the impressive improvements in machine learning algorithms, has increased our ability to understand and extract information from scenic events. In most cases, Convolution neural networks (CNNs) are largely adopted to infer knowledge due to their surprising success in automation, surveillance, and many other application domains. However, the convolution operations' overwhelming computation demand has somewhat limited their use in remote sensing edge devices. In these platforms, real-time processing remains a challenging task due to the tight constraints on resources and power. Here, the transfer and processing of non-relevant image pixels act as a bottleneck on the entire system. It is possible to overcome this bottleneck by exploiting the high bandwidth available at the sensor interface by designing a CNN inference architecture near the sensor. This paper presents an attention-based pixel processing architecture to facilitate the CNN inference near the image sensor. We propose an efficient computation method to reduce the dynamic power by decreasing the overall computation of the convolution operations. The proposed method reduces redundancies by using a hierarchical optimization approach. The approach minimizes power consumption for convolution operations by exploiting the Spatio-temporal redundancies found in the incoming feature maps and performs computations only on selected regions based on their relevance score. The proposed design addresses problems related to the mapping of computations onto an array of processing elements (PEs) and introduces a suitable network structure for communication. The PEs are highly optimized to provide low latency and power for CNN applications. While designing the model, we exploit the concepts of biological vision systems to reduce computation and energy. We prototype the model in a Virtex UltraScale+ FPGA and implement it in Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) using the TSMC 90nm technology library. The results suggest that the proposed architecture significantly reduces dynamic power consumption and achieves high-speed up surpassing existing embedded processors' computational capabilities.

ID SERVICE MIGRATION
AB Driven by the rapid development of accelerators and diverse efficiency requirements of the naturally heterogeneous neural network computation, recent years have seen increased heterogeneity in neural network accelerator systems in terms of network structures, accelerator dataflows and implementations. However, existing research fails to schedule and map the heterogeneous neural networks on heterogeneous accelerators efficiently. They rely on clumpy exhaustive search or complicated ad hoc mapping approaches due to the semantic gap between the networks and accelerators. This paper proposes a systematic method to transform various accelerators into standard parameterized containers of the neural network loops, which builds a direct connection between the computation and the underlying hardware resources. This enables us to match the neural networks with accelerators based on their essential characteristics (e.g., reuse opportunities and bandwidth requirements) without diving into the detailed architectures. To this end, we propose AINNS, an all-inclusive neural network scheduler, that automatically schedules and maps the NN computation on heterogeneous accelerators with just one universal algorithm. Our experimental results show the proposed AINNS not only performs well in the traditional neural network acceleration but also improves the system throughput and energy efficiency by 1.8x and 1.7x respectively in the most challenging heterogeneous acceleration system.

AB This manifesto critically examines the unfolding integration of Generative AI (GenAI), chatbots, and algorithms into higher education, using a collective and thoughtful approach to navigate the future of teaching and learning. GenAI, while celebrated for its potential to personalize learning, enhance efficiency, and expand educational accessibility, is far from a neutral tool. Algorithms now shape human interaction, communication, and content creation, raising profound questions about human agency and biases and values embedded in their designs. As GenAI continues to evolve, we face critical challenges in maintaining human oversight, safeguarding equity, and facilitating meaningful, authentic learning experiences. This manifesto emphasizes that GenAI is not ideologically and culturally neutral. Instead, it reflects worldviews that can reinforce existing biases and marginalize diverse voices. Furthermore, as the use of GenAI reshapes education, it risks eroding essential human elements- creativity, critical thinking, and empathy-and could displace meaningful human interactions with algorithmic solutions. This manifesto calls for robust, evidence-based research and conscious decision-making to ensure that GenAI enhances, rather than diminishes, human agency and ethical responsibility in education.

AB Premise When plants are exposed to stress conditions, irreversible damage can occur, negatively impacting yields. It is therefore important to detect stress symptoms in plants, such as the accumulation of anthocyanin, as early as possible. Methods and Results Twenty-two regression models in five color spaces were trained to develop a prediction model for plant anthocyanin levels from digital color imaging data. Of these, a quantile random forest regression model trained with standard red, green, blue (sRGB) color space data most accurately predicted the actual anthocyanin levels. This model was then used to noninvasively monitor the spatial and temporal accumulation of anthocyanin in Arabidopsis thaliana leaves. Conclusions The digital imaging-based nature of this protocol makes it a low-cost and noninvasive method for the detection of plant stress. Applying a similar protocol to more economically viable crops could lead to the development of large-scale, cost-effective systems for monitoring plant health.

AB A technique for enhancing finite-element analysis equation solvers for particular problem domains, i.e., particular classes of structures such as highway bridges, is presented. The technique involves merging artificial neural networks, used as a domain knowledge-encoding mechanism, together with a preconditioned conjugate gradient iterative equation-solving algorithm. In the algorithm, neural networks are used to seed the initial solution vector and to precondition the matrix system using customizable and trainable neural networks. A case study is presented in which the technique is applied to the particular domain of flat-slab highway bridge analysis. In the case study, neural networks are trained to encode the load-displacement relationships for concrete flat-slab highway bridges. Analytical load-displacement data are generated using finite-element analyses and subsequently used to train neural networks. Acting collectively, the neural networks predict approximate displacement patterns for flat-slab bridges under arbitrary loading conditions.

AB Objective: Brain-computer interface (BCI) provide a non-muscular communication channel for patients with impairments of the motor system. A significant number of BCI users is unable to obtain voluntary control of a BCI-system in proper time. This makes methods that can be used to determine the aptitude of a user necessary.
   Methods: We hypothesized that integrity and connectivity of involved white matter connections may serve as a predictor of individual BCI-performance. Therefore, we analyzed structural data from anatomical scans and DTI of motor imagery BCI-users differentiated into high and low BCI-aptitude groups based on their over all performance.
   Results: Using a machine learning classification method we identified discriminating structural brain trait features and correlated the best features with a continuous measure of individual BCI-performance. Prediction of the aptitude group of each participant was possible withn ear perfect accuracy (one error).
   Conclusions: Tissue volumetric analysis yielded only poor classification results. In contrast, the structural integrity and my elination quality of deep white matter structures such as the Corpus Callosum, Cingulum, and Superior Fronto-Occipital Fascicle were positively correlated with individual BCI performance.
   Significance: This confirms that structural brain traits contribute to individual performance in BCI use.

AB Background: A machine learning analysis was conducted on 5774 shoulder arthroplasty patients to create predictive models for multiple clinical outcome measures after anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (aTSA) and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (rTSA). The goal of this study was to compare the accuracy associated with a full feature set predictive model (ie, full model, comprising 291 parameters) and a minimal feature set model (ie, abbreviated model, comprising 19 input parameters) to predict clinical outcomes to assess the efficacy of using a minimal feature set of inputs as a shoulder arthroplasty clinical decision-support tool.
   Methods: Clinical data from 2153 primary aTSA patients and 3621 primary rTSA patients were analyzed using the XGBoost machine learning technique to create and test predictive models for multiple outcome measures at different postoperative time points via the full and abbreviated models. Mean absolute errors (MAEs) quantified the difference between actual and predicted outcomes, and each model also predicted whether a patient would experience clinical improvement greater than the patient satisfaction anchor-based thresholds of the minimal clinically important difference and substantial clinical benefit for each outcome measure at 2-3 years after surgery.
   Results: Across all postoperative time points analyzed, the full and abbreviated models had similar MAEs for the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score (+/- 11.7 with full model vs. +/- 12.0 with abbreviated model), Constant score (+8.9 vs. +/- 9.8), Global Shoulder Function score (+/- 1.4 vs. +/- 1.5), visual analog scale pain score (+/- 1.3 vs. +/- 1.4), active abduction (+/- 20.4 degrees - vs. +/- 21.8 degrees), forward elevation (+/- 17.6 degrees vs. +/- 19.2 degrees), and external rotation (+/- 12.2 degrees vs. +/- 12.6 degrees). Marginal improvements in MAEs were observed for each outcome measure prediction when the abbreviated model was supplemented with data on implant size and/or type and measurements of native glenoid anatomy. The full and abbreviated models each effectively risk stratified patients using only preoperative data by accurately identifying patients with improvement greater than the minimal clinically important difference and substantial clinical benefit thresholds.
   Discussion: Our study showed that the full and abbreviated machine learning models achieved similar accuracy in predicting clinical outcomes after aTSA and rTSA at multiple postoperative time points. These promising results demonstrate an efficient utilization of machine learning algorithms to predict clinical outcomes. Our findings using a minimal feature set of only 19 preoperative inputs suggest that this tool may be easily used during a surgical consultation to improve decision making related to shoulder arthroplasty.

TI GTOOLS - AN ACTIVE GUI TOOLSET FOR AN OBJECT-ORIENTED KBMS
SO COMPUTING SYSTEMS
LA English
DT Article
DE DATABASE MANAGEMENT; GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE; KNOWLEDGE-BASE MANAGEMENT
   SYSTEM
AB The value of a system with high functionalities is limited if it is not usable by a large number of users due to its complexity. For database applications supported by a conventional database management system (DBMS), the database is generally  defined using a data definition language and accessed using some data manipulation or query language. Although adequate for DBMSs based on simple models like the relational model, the language approach to user interface design is no longer adequate or desirable for a knowledge base management system (KBMS) which is constructed based on a more powerful and complex object-oriented, semantic model. In this paper, an active graphical user interface toolset (GTOOLS) for an object-oriented KBMS is presented. GTOOLS is a part of a prototype knowledge base management system which is based on an object-oriented semantic association model, OSAM*. It is an integrated set of tools consisting of schema design and editing tools, a querying tool, a schema browser, and facilities for rule browsing and editing. Using a windowing environment, GTOOLS possesses all the user-friendly features of the conventional windowing tools (e.g. interactive, graphical, highly structured menus, etc.). Additionally, each of the tools in GTOOLS is design to be usable by users of various levels of expertise. Most importantly, by taking advantage of the added semantics provided by the under-lying object-oriented semantic association model, GTOOLS is able to provide not only the conventional 'passive' help mechanisms (e.g. help screens, error messages, and interactive acquisition of information), but also 'active' help mechanisms throughout the toolset.

AB Objective: To accurately calculate the risk for postoperative complications and death after surgery in the preoperative period using machine-learning modeling of clinical data.
   Background: Postoperative complications cause a 2-fold increase in the 30-day mortality and cost, and arc associated with long-term consequences. The ability to precisely forecast the risk for major complications before surgery is limited.
   Methods: In a single-center cohort of 51,457 surgical patients undergoing major inpatient surgery, we have developed and validated an automated analytics framework for a preoperative risk algorithm (MySurgeryRisk) that uses existing clinical data in electronic health records to forecast patient-level probabilistic risk scores for 8 major postoperative complications (acute kidney injury, sepsis. venous thromboembolism, intensive care unit admission >48 hours, mechanical ventilation >48 hours. wound. neurologic, and cardiovascular complications) and death up to 24 months after surgery. We used the area under the receiver characteristic curve (AUC) and predictiveness curves to evaluate model performance.
   Results: MySurgeryRisk calculates probabilistic risk scores for 8 postoperative complications with AUC values ranging between 0.82 and 0.94 [99% confidence intervals (CIs) 0.81-0.94]. The model predicts the risk for death at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months with AUC values ranging between 0.77 and 0.83 (99% CI 0.76-0.85).
   Conclusions: We constructed an automated predictive analytics framework for machine-learning algorithm with high discriminatory ability for assessing the risk of surgical complications and death using readily available preoperative electronic health records data. The feasibility of this novel algorithm implemented in real time clinical workflow requires further testing.

AB Yield mapping for citrus fruit is a challenging task due to factors such as varying illumination conditions, clustering, and occlusions. Mapping the yield for immature citrus fruit presents an additional challenge that is the colours of fruit and leaves are almost identical. Commonly used machine vision techniques using colour cameras become less effective for immature citrus fruit detection. This study explores a novel active thermal imaging method to tackle the problem of colour similarity between immature citrus fruit and leaves. In this study, a thermal camera was combined with a water spray system that applied water mist to citrus trees. The water mist caused temperatures of both the fruit and leaf surfaces to change but at different rates. Multiple parameters of the spray system were experimented with the goal to induce as much temperature differences as possible between fruit and leaf surfaces. The combined system was tested in a citrus grove for fruit detections. Deep learning models were built based on the active thermal imaging system and tracking and fruit counting algorithms were created to count fruit in thermal videos. A mean average precision of 87.2% was achieved by the models and an accuracy of 96% was achieved when comparing the number of fruit counted by the algorithms with the true number of fruit counted manually in the field.

AB Contact-awareness poses a significant challenge in the locomotion control of soft snake robots. This article is to develop bioinspired contact-aware locomotion controllers, grounded in a novel theory pertaining to the feedback mechanism of the Matsuoka oscillator. This mechanism enables the Matsuoka central pattern generator (CPG) system to function analogously to a "spinal cord" in the entire contact-aware control framework. Specifically, it concurrently integrates stimuli, such as tonic input signals originating from the "brain" (a goal-tracking locomotion controller) and sensory feedback signals from the "reflex arc" (the contact reactive controller), for generating different types of rhythmic signals to orchestrate the movement of the soft snake robot traversing through densely populated obstacles and even narrow aisles. Within the "reflex arc" design, we have designed two distinct types of contact reactive controllers: 1) a reinforcement learning-based sensor regulator that learns to modulate the sensory feedback inputs of the CPG system, and 2) a local reflexive controller that establishes a direct connection between sensor readings and the CPG's feedback inputs, adhering to a specific topological configuration. These two reactive controllers, when combined with the goal-tracking locomotion controller and the Matsuoka CPG system, facilitate the implementation of two contact-aware locomotion control schemes. Both control schemes have been rigorous tested and evaluated in both simulated and real-world soft snake robots, demonstrating commendable performance in contact-aware locomotion tasks. These experimental outcomes further validate the benefits of the modified Matsuoka CPG system, augmented by a novel sensory feedback mechanism, for the design of bioinspired robot controllers.

AB This paper contributes a tutorial level discussion of some interesting properties of the recent Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) divergence measure between probability density functions. This measure brings together elements from several different machine learning fields, namely information theory, graph theory and Mercer kernel and spectral theory. These connections are revealed when estimating the CS divergence non-parametrically using the Parzen window technique for density estimation. An important consequence of these connections is that they enhance our understanding of the different machine learning schemes relative to each other. (C) 2006 The Franklin Institute.

AB Background: Prediabetes affects 1 in 3 US adults. Most are not receiving evidence-based interventions, so understanding how providers discuss prediabetes with patients will inform how to improve their care.
   Objective: This study aimed to develop a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm using machine learning techniques to identify discussions of prediabetes in narrative documentation.
   Methods: We developed and applied a keyword search strategy to identify discussions of prediabetes in clinical documentation for patients with prediabetes. We manually reviewed matching notes to determine which represented actual prediabetes discussions. We applied 7 machine learning models against our manual annotation.
   Results: Machine learning classifiers were able to achieve classification results that were close to human performance with up to 98% precision and recall to identify prediabetes discussions in clinical documentation.
   Conclusions: We demonstrated that prediabetes discussions can be accurately identified using an NLP algorithm. This approach can be used to understand and identify prediabetes management practices in primary care, thereby informing interventions to improve guideline-concordant care.

AB To continue space operations with the increasing space debris, accurate characterization of fragment fly-out properties from hypervelocity impacts is essential. However, with limited realistic experimentation and the need for data, available static arena test data, collected utilizing a novel stereoscopic imaging technique, is the primary dataset for this paper. This research leverages machine learning methodologies to predict fragmentation characteristics using combined data from this imaging technique and simulations, produced considering dynamic impact conditions. Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), fit via expectation maximization (EM), are used to model fragment track intersections on a defined surface of intersection. After modeling the fragment distributions, knearest neighbor (K-NN) regressors are used to predict the desired characteristics. Using Monte Carlo simulations, the K-NN regression is shown to predict the distributions for both the total number of fragments intersecting a given surface, as well as the expected total fragment velocity and mass associated with that surface. This information can then be used to estimate the kinetic energy of the particle to classify the particle and avoid debris collisions.

AB Background: Machine learning-enabled clinical information systems (ML-CISs) have the potential to drive health care delivery and research. The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) data standard has been increasingly applied in developing these systems. However, methods for applying FHIR to ML-CISs are variable.Objective: This study evaluates and compares the functionalities, strengths, and weaknesses of existing systems and proposes guidelines for optimizing future work with ML-CISs.Methods: Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science were searched for articles describing machine learning systems that were used for clinical data analytics or decision support in compliance with FHIR standards. Information regarding each system's functionality, data sources, formats, security, performance, resource requirements, scalability, strengths, and limitations was compared across systems.Results: A total of 39 articles describing FHIR-based ML-CISs were divided into the following three categories according to their primary focus: clinical decision support systems (n=18), data management and analytic platforms (n=10), or auxiliary modules and application programming interfaces (n=11). Model strengths included novel use of cloud systems, Bayesian networks, visualization strategies, and techniques for translating unstructured or free-text data to FHIR frameworks. Many intelligent systems lacked electronic health record interoperability and externally validated evidence of clinical efficacy.Conclusions: Shortcomings in current ML-CISs can be addressed by incorporating modular and interoperable data manage-scalability to support both real-time and prospective clinical applications that use electronic health record platforms with

AB The expression of microRNA (miRNA) is influenced by ongoing biological processes, including aging, and has begun to play a role in the measurement of neurodegenerative processes in central nervous system. The purpose of this study is to utilize machine learning approaches to determine whether miRNA can be utilized as a blood-based biomarker of cognitive aging. A random forest regression combining miRNA with biological (brain volume), clinical (comorbid conditions), and demographic variables in 115 typically aging older adults explained the greatest level of variance in cognitive performance compared to the other machine learning models explored. Three miRNA (miR-140-5p, miR-197-3p, and miR-501-3p) were top-ranked predictors of multiple cognitive outcomes (Fluid, Crystallized, and Overall Cognition) and past studies of these miRNA link them to cellular senescence, inflammatory signals for atherosclerotic formation, and potential development of neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease). Several novel miRNAs were also linked to age and multiple cognitive functions, findings which together warrant further exploration linking these miRNAs to brain-derived metrics of neurodegeneration in typically aging older adults.

AB The theory of artificial neural networks has been successfully applied to a wide variety of pattern recognition problems. In this theory, the first step in computing the next state of a neuron or in performing the next layer neural-network computation involves the linear operation of multiplying neural values by their synaptic strengths and adding the results. A nonlinear activation function usually follows the linear operation in order to provide for nonlinearity of the network and set the next state of the neuron. In this paper we introduce a novel class of artificial neural networks, called morphological neural networks, in which the operations of multiplication and addition are replaced by addition and maximum (or minimum), respectively. By taking the maximum (or minimum) of sums instead of the sum of products, morphological network computation is nonlinear before possible application of a nonlinear activation function. As a consequence, the properties of morphological neural networks are drastically different than those of traditional neural-network models. The main emphasis of the research presented here is on morphological associative memories. We examine the computing and storage capabilities of morphological associative memories and discuss differences between morphological models and traditional semilinear models such as the Hopfield net.

TI TIME-SERIES FORECASTING USING NEURAL NETWORKS VS BOX-JENKINS METHODOLOGY

DT Article
AB We discuss the results of a comparative study of the performance of neural networks and conventional methods in forecasting time series.  Our work was initially inspired by previously published works that yielded inconsistent results about comparative performance.  We have experimented with three time series of different complexity using different feed forward, backpropagation neural network models and the standard Box-Jenkins model.  Our experiments demonstrate that for time series with long memory, both methods produced comparable results.  However, for series with short memory, neural networks outperformed the Box-Jenkins model.  We note that some of the comparable results arise since the neural network and time series model appear to be functionally similar models.  We have found that for time series of different complexities there are optimal neural network topologies and parameters that enable them to learn more efficiently.  Our initial conclusions are that neural networks are robust and provide good long-term forecasting.  They are also parsimonious in their data requirements.  Neural networks represent a promising alternative for forecasting, but there are problems determining the optimal topology and parameters for efficient learning.

AB Credit-risk evaluation decisions are important for the financial institutions involved due to the high level of risk associated with wrong decisions. The process of making credit-risk evaluation decision is complex and unstructured. Neural networks are known to perform reasonably well compared to alternate methods for this problem. However, a drawback of using neural networks for credit-risk evaluation decision is that once a decision is made, it is extremely difficult to explain the rationale behind that decision, Researchers have developed methods using neural network to extract rules, which are then used to explain the reasoning behind a given neural network output. These rules do not capture the learned knowledge well enough. Neurofuzzy systems have been recently developed utilizing the desirable properties of both fuzzy systems as well as neural networks. These neurofuzzy systems can be used to develop fuzzy rules naturally. In this study, we analyze the beneficial aspects of using both neurofuzzy systems as well as neural networks for credit-risk evaluation decisions. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The behaviour of building occupants in the first stage of an evacuation can dramatically impact the time required to evacuate buildings. This behaviour has been widely investigated by scholars with a macroscopic approach fitting random distributions to represent the pre-evacuation time, i.e. time from noticing the first cue until deliberate movement. However, microscopic investigations on how building occupants respond to several social and environmental factors are still rare in the literature.
   This paper aims to leverage machine learning as a possible solution to investigate factors affecting building occupants' decision-making during pre-evacuation stage. In particular, we focus on applying interpretable machine learning to reveal the interactions among the input variables and to capture nonlinear relationships between the input variables and the outcome. As such, we use a well-established machine-learning algorithm-random forest-to model and predict people's emergency behaviour pre-evacuation. We then apply tools to interpret the black-box random forest model to extract useful knowledge and gain insights for emergency planning. Specifically, this algorithm is applied here to investigate the behaviour of 569 building occupants split between five unannounced evacuation drills in a cinema theatre. The results indicate that both social and environmental factors affect the probability of responding. Several independent variables, such as the time elapsed after the alarm has started and the decision-maker's group size, are presenting strong nonlinear relationships with the probability of switching to the response stage. Furthermore, we find interactions exist between the row number where the decision-maker sits and the number of responding occupants visible to her; the complex relationship between the outcome and these two variables can be visualized by using a two-dimensional partial dependence plot. An interesting finding is that a decision-maker is more sensitive to the proportion of responding occupants than the number of them; hence, the people sitting in the back are often responding more slowly than the people in the front.

AB Network alignment, which aims at learning amatching between the same entities across multiple information networks, often suffers challenges from feature inconsistency, high-dimensional features, to unstable alignment results. This article presents a novel network alignment framework, Unsupervised Adversarial learning based Network Alignment (UANA), that combines generative adversarial network (GAN) and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to tackle the above critical challenges. First, we propose a bidirectional adversarial network distribution matching model to perform the bidirectional cross-network alignment translations between two networks, such that the distributions of real and translated networks completely overlap together. In addition, two cross-network alignment translation cycles are constructed for training the unsupervised alignment without the need of prior alignment knowledge. Second, in order to address the feature inconsistency issue, we integrate a dual adversarial autoencoder module with an adversarial binary classification model together to project two copies of the same vertices with high-dimensional inconsistent features into the same low-dimensional embedding space. This facilitates the translations of the distributions of two networks in the adversarial network distribution matching model. Finally, we develop an RL based optimization approach to solve the vertex matching problem in the discrete space of the GAN model, i.e., directly select the vertices in target networks most relevant to the vertices in source networks, without unstable similarity computation that is sensitive to discriminative features and similarity metrics. Extensive evaluation on realworld graph datasets demonstrates the outstanding capability of UANA to address the unsupervised network alignment problem, in terms of both effectiveness and scalability.

AB We propose modeling Group Support System (GSS) search tasks with Genetic Algorithms. Using explicit mathematical models for Genetic Algorithms (GAS), we show how to estimate the underlying GA parameters from an observed GSS solution path. Once these parameters are estimated, they may be related to GSS variables such as group composition and membership, leadership presence, the specific GSS tools available, incentive structure, and organizational culture. The estimated Genetic Algorithm parameters can be used with the mathematical models for GAS to compute or simulate expected GSS process outcomes.

AB This study aimed to (a) explore the roles of cognitive and language variables in predicting reading abilities of two groups of individuals with reading disabilities (i.e., dyslexia and specific language impairment) and (b) examine which variable(s) is the most predictive in differentiating two groups. Inclusion/exclusion criteria applied to categorize the two groups yielded a total of 63 participants (n = 44 for the dyslexia; n = 19 for the specific language impairment). A stepwise multiple regression approach was conducted to examine which cognitive and/or language variables made the largest contribution to reading abilities (i.e., Phonetic Decoding Efficiency, Word Attack, Sight Word Efficiency, and Passage Comprehension). Results revealed that there were significant differences in which measures of cognitive and language ability predicted individuals with dyslexia and speech and language impairments reading ability, showing that the cognitive and language variables underlying their difficulty with reading abilities were not the same across the two groups. A discriminant function analysis showed that a measure of Verbal Comprehension, Phonological Awareness, and Phonetic Decoding Efficiency can be used to differentiate the two groups. These findings support the tenet that dyslexia and specific language impairment are two subgroups of reading disabilities and that thorough diagnostic evaluations are needed to differentiate between these two subgroups. Distinctions of this nature are central to determining the type and intensity of language-based interventions.

AB Simulations are increasingly used for instruction and training purposes in many application areas such as commercial and military aviation, battlefield management, building construction, product manufacturing, medical education and others. However, most simulation systems are monolithic, ad hoc and non-reusable. In this work, we apply learning object and e-leaming service technologies to modularize an existing Web-based simulation system called the Virtual Anesthesia Machine (VAM). Instructional materials associated with the components of the simulation system are encapsulated as reusable Atomic Learning Objects, each of which consists of content items, practice items, assessment items, meta-information and constraints. Instructional materials associated with the entire simulation system is modeled as a Composite Learning Object having a structure of activities, which is used by a Learning Process Execution Engine to enact the process of delivering contents, instructing learners to use the simulation system for practice on what they learn, and performing assessment to evaluate the performances of learners in learning the functions and operations of the simulation system and its components. An event-trigger-rule server is used in an event-driven, rule-based execution of a learning process to make the learning process active, adaptive, customizable and flexible.

AB The nature of firefighters' duties requires them to work for long periods under unfavorable conditions. To perform their jobs effectively, they are required to endure long hours of extensive, stressful training. Creating such training environments is very expensive and it is difficult to guarantee trainees' safety. In this study, firefighters are trained in a virtual environment that includes virtual perturbations such as fires, alarms, and smoke. The objective of this paper is to use machine learning methods to discern encoding and retrieval states in firefighters during a visuospatial episodic memory task and explore which regions of the brain provide suitable signals to solve this classification problem. Our results show that the Random Forest algorithm could be used to distinguish between information encoding and retrieval using features extracted from fNIRS data. Our algorithm achieved an F-1 score of 0.844 and an accuracy of 79.10% if the training and testing data are obtained at similar environmental conditions. However, the algorithm's performance dropped to an F-1 score of 0.723 and accuracy of 60.61% when evaluated on data collected under different environmental conditions than the training data. We also found that if the training and evaluation data were recorded under the same environmental conditions, the RPM, LDLPFC, RDLPFC were the most relevant brain regions under non-stressful, stressful, and a mix of stressful and non-stressful conditions, respectively.

AB Background: Advances in computational algorithms and the availability of large datasets with clinically relevant characteristics provide an opportunity to develop machine learning prediction models to aid in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of older adults. Some studies have employed machine learning methods for prediction modeling, but skepticism of these methods remains due to lack of reproducibility and difficulty in understanding the complex algorithms that underlie models. We aim to provide an overview of two common machine learning methods: decision tree and random forest. We focus on these methods because they provide a high degree of interpretability.
   Method: We discuss the underlying algorithms of decision tree and random forest methods and present a tutorial for developing prediction models for serious fall injury using data from the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study.
   Results: Decision tree is a machine learning method that produces a model resembling a flow chart. Random forest consists of a collection of many decision trees whose results are aggregated. In the tutorial example, we discuss evaluation metrics and interpretation for these models. Illustrated using data from the LIFE study, prediction models for serious fall injury were moderate at best (area under the receiver operating curve of 0.54 for decision tree and 0.66 for random forest).
   Conclusions: Machine learning methods offer an alternative to traditional approaches for modeling outcomes in aging, but their use should be justified and output should be carefully described. Models should be assessed by clinical experts to ensure compatibility with clinical practice.

ID IDEATION
AB Background: Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide, making early identification of suicidal behaviors crucial for clinicians. Current Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches for identifying suicidal behaviors in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) rely on keyword searches, rule-based methods, and binary classification, which may not fully capture the complexity and spectrum of suicidal behaviors. This study aims to create a multi-class labeled dataset with annotation guidelines and develop a novel NLP approach for fine-grained, multi-label classification of suicidal behaviors, improving the efficiency of the annotation process and accuracy of the NLP methods. Methods: We develop a multi-class labeling system based on guidelines from FDA, CDC, and WHO, distinguishing between six categories of suicidal behaviors and allowing for multiple labels per data sample. To efficiently create an annotated dataset, we use an MPNet-based semantic retrieval framework to extract relevant sentences from a large EHR dataset, reducing annotation space while capturing diverse expressions. Experts annotate the extracted sentences using the multi-class system. We then formulate the task as a multi-label classification problem and fine-tune transformer-based models on the curated dataset to accurately classify suicidal behaviors in EHRs. Results: Lexical analysis revealed key themes in assessing suicide risk, considering an individual's history, mental health, substance use, and family background. Fine-tuned transformer-based models effectively identified suicidal behaviors from EHRs, with Bio_ClinicalBERT, BioBERT, and XLNet achieving the F1 scores (0.81), outperforming BERT and RoBERTa. The proposed approach, based on a multi-label classification system, captures the complexity of suicidal behaviors effectively particularly "Suicide Attempt"and "Family History"instances. The proposed approach, using task-specific NLP models and a multi-label classification system, captures the complexity of suicidal behaviors more effectively than traditional binary classification. However, direct comparisons with existing studies are difficult due to varying metrics and label definitions. Conclusion: This study presents a robust NLP framework for detecting suicidal behaviors in EHRs, leveraging task-specific fine-tuning of transformer-based models and a semi-automated pipeline. Despite limitations, the approach demonstrates the potential of advanced NLP techniques in enhancing the identification of suicidal behaviors. Future work should focus on model expansion and integration to further improve patient care and clinical decision-making.

TI Noise2Clean: Cross-Device Side-Channel Traces Denoising with

DE deep learning; side-channel analysis; denoising model
AB Deep learning (DL)-based side-channel analysis (SCA) has posed a severe challenge to the security and privacy of embedded devices. During its execution, an attacker exploits physical SCA leakages collected from profiling devices to create a DL model for recovering secret information from victim devices. Despite this success, recent works have demonstrated that certain countermeasures, such as random delay interrupts or clock jitters, would make these attacks more complex and less practical in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we present a novel denoising scheme that exploits the U-Net model to pre-process SCA traces for "noises" (i.e., countermeasures) removal. Specifically, we first pre-train the U-Net model on the paired noisy-clean profiling traces to obtain suitable parameters. This model is then fine-tuned on the noisy-only traces collected from the attacking device. The well-trained model will be finally deployed on the attacking device to remove the noises (i.e., countermeasures) from the measured power traces. In particular, a new inductive transfer learning method is also utilized in our scheme to transfer knowledge learned from the source domain (i.e., profiling device) to the target domain (i.e., attacking device) to improve the model's generalization ability. During our experimental evaluations, we conduct a detailed analysis of various countermeasures separately or combined and show that the proposed denoising model outperforms current state-of-the-art work by a large margin, e.g., a reduction of at least 30% in computation costs and 5x in guessing entropy.

AB Psychological crackdown of phishing emails can gain major momentum and success through understanding and classifying phishing emails. Phishing is a preferred way of hackers and has always provided back door entry to the file systems through browsers, plugins and malwares. As analysis is getting refined and people can be identified based on several aspects like network traffic and application usage, people with certain contexts can be traced and targeted easily. While hacking system can be specific and requires definite skills and information, phishing emails can be an easy way to target specific people of interest through information and analysis. To counter that, we propose a model to engage people about these vulnerabilities through creating better understanding the contents and psychology of language. To handle the multiclass language classification problem, we propose an ensemble of classifiers with two-stage training. The ensemble method is characterized by data augmented feature training and negative sampling approach-based generalization. Phishing email-based attack is more psychological than technical as it involves the victim voluntarily (through deception) get into it than exploiting technical fallacies and are difficult to segregate. In this work, we have discussed the various psychological aspects in phishing emails from the point of view of natural language processing and learning to detect them.

ID SELECTION-BIAS; SMOTE; CARE
AB Machine learning models are increasingly adopted for facilitating clinical decision-making. However, recent research has shown that machine learning techniques may result in potential biases when making decisions for peo-ple in different subgroups, which can lead to detrimental effects on the health and well-being of specific demo-graphic groups such as vulnerable ethnic minorities. This problem, termed algorithmic bias, has been extensively studied in theoretical machine learning recently. However, the impact of algorithmic bias on medicine and methods to mitigate this bias remain topics of active discussion. This paper presents a comprehensive review of algorithmic fairness in the context of computational medicine, which aims at improving medicine with computational approaches. Specifically, we overview the different types of algorithmic bias, fairness quantification metrics, and bias mitigation methods, and summarize popular software libraries and tools for bias evaluation and mitigation, with the goal of providing reference and insights to researchers and practitioners in computational medicine.Copyright (c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB Global food systems can benefit significantly from continuous monitoring of microbial food safety, a task for which tedious operations, destructive sampling, and the inability to monitor multiple pathogens remain challenging. This study reports significant improvements to a paper chromogenic array sensor - machine learning (PCA-ML) methodology sensing concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted on a speciesspecific basis by pathogens by streamlining dye selection, sensor fabrication, database construction, and machine learning and validation. This approach enables noncontact, time-dependent, simultaneous monitoring of multiple pathogens (Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, and E. coli O157:H7) at levels as low as 1 log CFU/g with over 90% accuracy. The report provides theoretical and practical frameworks demonstrating that chromogenic response, including limits of detection, depends on time integrals of VOC concentrations. The paper also discusses the potential for implementing PCA-ML in the food supply chain for different food matrices and pathogens, with species- and strain-specific identification.

ID TWITTER; INFORMATION; TWEETS
AB Previous research has employed social media index such as disaster-related ratio (DIRR) or damage-related ratio (DARR) and sentiment to estimate the damages during disasters. These studies mainly used predefined keywords to filter disaster- and damage-related social media data. However, many tweets containing predefined keywords (e.g., Hurricane Matthew) do not describe disaster events or their impacts. Meanwhile, previous sentiment analysis has not considered users' tweet frequencies, which can bring in data bias. These studies also lacked a baseline to reflect disaster impacts on the public's sentiment. Therefore, this research proposes to use supervised machine-learning approach to identify the damage-related social media data. It also analyzes users' tweet frequencies and introduces the annual average sentiment as the baseline to calculate the normalized sentiment. Compared with previous research, the authors' method has identified more damage-related tweets and demonstrated higher precision and recall. Correlation analysis is conducted between the social media index and the insurance claim data in Hurricane Matthew. The results show a strong and positive correlation between the DARR and claim data. A strong and negative correlation is found between sentiment and claim data. The adjusted R2 of the final regression model between damage and social media index demonstrates the feasibility of mining social media data for rapid damage assessment. The results can benefit crisis response managers in collecting real-time information and understanding timely situations during disasters. (c) 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB Frailty, an age-related syndrome, is associated with poor post-operative outcomes. The impact of community-level social determinants of health (SDoH) on pre-operative frailty has not been investigated yet. We developed a machine learning model to predict pre-operative frailty using an institutional dataset and applied it to a more geographically diverse population from the OneFlorida+ Clinical Research Consortium. Computable phenotyping for SDoH stratification using unsupervised learning was employed to identify distinct patient profiles based on zip code-level SDoH characteristics. We applied multivariate logistic regression to examine the association between SDoH profiles and pre-operative frailty risk. Adverse community-level SDoH profiles are independently associated with higher pre-operative frailty risk; patients from the disadvantaged SDoH profile had 1.21 times higher odds (95% CI 1.16-1.26) of being frail compared to the advantaged SDoH cluster after adjusting for potential confounders. Considering patients' social context could improve pre-operative care and surgical outcomes, informing clinical practice and policies.

DE CONCEPTUAL CLUSTERING; SCHEMA EVOLUTION; MACHINE LEARNING; CASE-BASED
   REASONING; EXPLANATION-BASED LEARNING; EXCEPTION HANDLING
AB Conceptual clustering techniques based on current theories of categorization provide a way to design database schemas that more accurately represent classes. An approach is presented in which classes are treated as complex clusters of concepts rather than as simple predicates. An important service provided by the database is determining whether a particular instance is a member of a class. A conceptual clustering algorithm based on theories of categorization aids in building classes by grouping related instances and developing class descriptions. The resulting database schema addresses a number of properties of categories, including default values and prototypes, analogical reasoning, exception handling, and family resemblance. Class cohesion results from trying to resolve conflicts between building generalized class descriptions and accommodating members of the class that deviate from these descriptions. This is achieved by combining techniques from machine learning, specifically explanation-based learning and case-based reasoning. A subsumption function is used to compare two class descriptions. A realization function is used to determine whether an instance meets an existing class description. A new function, INTERSECT, is introduced to compare the similarity of two instances. INTERSECT is used in defining an exception condition. Exception handling results in schema modification. This approach is applied to the database problems of schema integration, schema generation, query processing, and view creation.

AB Background: The aim of this study was to improve understanding of hospital length of stay (LOS) in patients undergoing total joint arthroplasty (TJA) in a high-efficiency, hospital-based pathway. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 1401 consecutive primary and revision TJA patients across 67 patient and preoperative care characteristics from 2016 to 2019 from the institutional electronic health records. A machine learning approach, testing multiple models, was used to assess predictors of LOS. Results: The median LOS was 1 day; outpatients accounted for 16.5%, 1-day inpatient stays for 38.0%, 2day stays for 26.4%, and 3-days or more for 19.1%. Patients characteristically fell into 1 of 3 broad categories that contained relatively similar characteristics: outpatient (0-day LOS), short stay (1- to 2-day LOS), and prolonged stay (3 days or greater). The random forest models suggested that a lower Risk Assessment and Prediction Tool score, unplanned admission or hospital transfer, and a medical history of cardiovascular disease were associated with an increased LOS. Documented narcotic use for surgery preparation prior to hospitalization and preoperative corticosteroid use were factors independently associated with a decreased LOS. Conclusions: After TJA, most patients have either an outpatient or short-stay hospital episode. Patients who stay 2 days do not differ substantially from patients who stay 1 day, while there is a distinct group that requires prolonged admission. Our machine learning models support a better understanding of the patient factors associated with different hospital LOS categories for TJA, demonstrating the potential for improved health policy decisions and risk stratification for centers caring for complex patients.

AB Fresh fruit and vegetables are invaluable for human health; however, their quality often deteriorates before reaching consumers due to ongoing biochemical processes and compositional changes. We currently lack any objective indices which indicate the freshness of fruit or vegetables resulting in limited capacity to improve product quality eventually leading to food loss and waste. In this conducted study, we hypothesized that certain proteins and compounds, such as glucosinolates, could be used as one potential indicator to monitor the freshness of broccoli following harvest. To support our study, glucosinolate contents in broccoli based on HPLC measurement and transcript expression of glucosinolate biosynthetic genes in response to postharvest stresses were evaluated. We found that the glucosinolate biosynthetic pathway coincided with the progression of senescence in postharvest broccoli during storage. Additionally, we applied machine learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) analysis, unmixing, and subpixel target detection approaches to evaluate glucosinolate level to detect postharvest senescence in broccoli. This study provides an accessible approach to precisely estimate freshness in broccoli through machine learning-based hyperspectral image analysis. Such a tool would further allow significant advancement in postharvest logistics and bolster the availability of high-quality, nutritious fresh produce.

AB With the rapid growth in the volume of relevant and available data, feature engineering is emerging as a popular research subject in data-driven building energy prediction owing to its essential role in improving data quality. Many studies have examined the feasibility of applying feature engineering methods to data-driven building energy prediction. However, a systematic review of this area's research status, characteristics, and limitations is lacking. Therefore, this study analyzes the current status of research and directions of future work in feature engineering for building energy prediction. In this article, we first discuss the concept of feature engineering and its main methods, including the construction, selection, and extraction of features. We, then, summarize the status and characteristics of feature engineering research in the building energy domain using a comprehensive study of 172 relevant articles. We also discuss critical issues in feature engineering in data-driven building energy prediction, including why feature engineering has recently received increasing attention, whether it is useful in this domain, and effective ways to apply it. Finally, we identify promising research directions in the area based on its current state and limitations. The results here provide researchers and the industry with a better understanding of the state of the art and future research trends in feature engineering for data-driven building energy prediction.

AB Background The use of Intra-aortic Balloon Pump (IABP) and Impella devices as a bridge to heart transplantation (HTx) has increased significantly in recent times. This study aimed to create and validate an explainable machine learning (ML) model that can predict the failure of status two listings and identify the clinical features that significantly impact this outcome.Methods We used the UNOS registry database to identify HTx candidates listed as UNOS Status 2 between 2018 and 2022 and supported with either Impella (5.0 or 5.5) or IABP. We used the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm to build and validate ML models. We developed two models: (1) a comprehensive model that included all patients in our cohort and (2) separate models designed for each of the 11 UNOS regions.Results We analyzed data from 4,178 patients listed as Status 2. Out of them, 12% had primary outcomes indicating Status 2 failure. Our ML models were based on 19 variables from the UNOS data. The comprehensive model had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.71 (+/- 0.03), with a range between 0.44 (+/- 0.08) and 0.74 (+/- 0.01) across different regions. The models' specificity ranged from 0.75 to 0.96. The top five most important predictors were the number of inotropes, creatinine, sodium, BMI, and blood group.Conclusion Using ML is clinically valuable for highlighting patients at risk, enabling healthcare providers to offer intensified monitoring, optimization, and care escalation selectively.

   Bycatch; Machine learning; Random Forest
ID SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS; CLASSIFIER; SPACE
AB Relative to target species, priority conservation species occur rarely in fishery interactions, resulting in imbalanced, overdispersed data. We present Ensemble Random Forests (ERFs) as an intuitive extension of the Random Forest algorithm to handle rare event bias. Each Random Forest receives individual stratified randomly sampled training/test sets, then down-samples the majority class for each decision tree. Results are averaged across Random Forests to generate an ensemble prediction. Through simulation, we show that ERFs outperform Random Forest with and without down-sampling, as well as with the synthetic minority over-sampling technique, for highly class imbalanced to balanced datasets. Spatial covariance greatly impacts ERFs' perceived performance, as shown through simulation and case studies. In case studies from the Hawaii deep-set longline fishery, giant manta ray Mobula birostris syn. Manta birostris and scalloped hammerhead Sphyrna lewini presence had high spatial covariance and high model test performance, while false killer whale Pseudorca crassidens had low spatial covariance and low model test performance. Overall, we find ERFs have 4 advantages: (1) reduced successive partitioning effects; (2) prediction uncertainty propagation; (3) better accounting for interacting covariates through balancing; and (4) minimization of false positives, as the majority of Random Forests within the ensemble vote correctly. As ERFs can readily mitigate rare event bias without requiring large presence sample sizes or imparting considerable balancing bias, they are likely to be a valuable tool in bycatch and species distribution modeling, as well as spatial conservation planning, especially for protected species where presence can be rare.

AB Introduction Monitoring bycatch of protected species is a fisheries management priority. In practice, protected species bycatch is difficult to precisely or accurately estimate with commonly used ratio estimators or parametric, linear model-based methods. Machine-learning algorithms have been proposed as means of overcoming some of the analytical hurdles in estimating protected species bycatch.Methods Using 17 years of set-specific bycatch data derived from 100% observer coverage of the Hawaii shallow-set longline fishery and 25 aligned environmental predictors, we evaluated a new approach for protected species bycatch estimation using Ensemble Random Forests (ERFs). We tested the ability of ERFs to predict interactions with five protected species with varying levels of bycatch in the fishery and methods for correcting these predictions using Type I and Type II error rates from the training data. We also assessed the amount of training data needed to inform a ERF approach by mimicking the sequential addition of new data in each subsequent fishing year.Results We showed that ERF bycatch estimation was most effective for species with greater than 2% interaction rates and error correction improved bycatch estimates for all species but introduced a tendency to regress estimates towards mean rates in the training data. Training data needs differed among species but those above 2% interaction rates required 7-12 years of bycatch data.Discussion Our machine learning approach can improve bycatch estimates for rare species but comparisons are needed to other approaches to assess which methods perform best for hyperrare species.

AB Objective The purpose of this study is to assess the "real-world" impact of an artificial intelligence (AI) tool designed to detect breast cancer in digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) screening exams following 12 months of utilization in a subspecialized academic breast center. Methods Following IRB approval, mammography audit reports, as specified in the BI-RADS atlas, were retrospectively generated for five radiologists reading at three locations during a 12-month time frame. One location had the AI tool (iCAD ProFound AI v2.0), and the other two locations did not. The co-primary endpoints were cancer detection rate (CDR) and abnormal interpretation rate (AIR). Secondary endpoints included positive predictive values (PPVs) for cancer among screenings with abnormal interpretations (PPV1) and for biopsies performed (PPV3). Odds ratios (OR) with two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) summarized the impact of AI across radiologists using generalized estimating equations. Results Nonsignificant differences were observed in CDR, AIR, and PPVs. The CDR was 7.3 with AI and 5.9 without AI (OR 1.3, 95% CI: 0.9-1.7). The AIR was 11.7% with AI and 11.8% without AI (OR 1.0, 95% CI: 0.8-1.3). The PPV1 was 6.2% with AI and 5.0% without AI (OR 1.3, 95% CI: 0.97-1.7). The PPV3 was 33.3% with AI and 32.0% without AI (OR 1.1, 95% CI: 0.8-1.5). Conclusion Although we are unable to show statistically significant changes in CDR and AIR outcomes in the two groups, the results are consistent with prior reader studies. There is a nonsignificant trend toward improvement in CDR with AI, without significant increases in AIR.

ID DISPARITIES
AB Background: We investigated a diverse population of newly diagnosed breast cancer patients to characterize factors associated with adherence to timely surgery. Methods: Machine learning (ML) methods were applied to electronic health record (EHR) and tumor registry data of women diagnosed with stage 0 through III breast cancer between 2014 and 2019. The ML architectures were evaluated and selected to stratify patients by risk of non-adherence to surgery. The most performant model was selected using the area under the curve (AUC) criteria. The high over low Area Deprivation Index (ADI) adherence ratio (HLAR) was plotted against time. The patients who received timely surgery that followed diagnostic confirmation indicated adherence. Results: A total of 1,004 women with breast cancer were included. The performance of the ML model at 110 days had an AUC of 0.82. The ADI was found to be the most important feature. The HLAR curve for high (most deprived) ADI shifted to the right compared to the low ADI curve, suggesting an increased delay to treatment for patients living in the most deprived zones. Conclusions: The degree of deprivation appeared to be a valid feature to help predict non-adherence, along with cancer stage and patient demographics. This important finding will guide future interventions to first predict who is at risk for non-adherence and then to study interventions to mitigate the risks. Future research needs to move from identification of non-adherence risk factors to development and implementation of interventions to mitigate the risk and improve timely adherence.

AB Outsourced printed circuit board (PCB) fabrication necessitates increased hardware assurance capabilities. Several assurance techniques based on automated optical inspection (AOI) have been proposed that leverage PCB images acquired using digital cameras. We review state-of-the-art AOI techniques and observe a strong, rapid trend toward machine learning (ML) solutions. These require significant amounts of labeled ground truth data, which is lacking in the publicly available PCB data space. We contribute the FICS PCB Image Collection (FPIC) dataset to address this need. Additionally, we outline new hardware security methodologies enabled by our dataset.

TI How effective is machine learning to detect long transient gravitational
   waves from neutron stars in a real search?
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
LA English
DT Article
AB We present a comprehensive study of the effectiveness of convolution neural networks (CNNs) to detect long-duration transient gravitational-wave signals lasting O(hours-days) from isolated neutron stars. We determine that CNNs are robust towards signal morphologies that differ from the training set, and they do not require many training injections/data to guarantee good detection efficiency and low false alarm probability. In fact, we only need to train one CNN on signal/noise maps in a single 150 Hz band; afterwards, the CNN can distinguish signals/noise well in any band, though with different efficiencies and false alarm probabilities due to the nonstationary noise in LIGO/Virgo. We demonstrate that we can control the false alarm probability for the CNNs by selecting the optimal threshold on the outputs of the CNN, which appears to be frequency dependent. Finally we compare the detection efficiencies of the networks to a well-established algorithm, the Generalized FrequencyHough (GFH), which maps curves in the time/frequency plane to lines in a plane that relates to the initial frequency/spin-down of the source. The networks have similar sensitivities to the GFH but are orders of magnitude faster to run and can detect signals to which the GFH is blind. Using the results of our analysis, we propose strategies to apply CNNs to a real search using LIGO/Virgo data to overcome the obstacles that we would encounter, such as a finite amount of training data. We then use our networks and strategies to run a real search for a remnant of GW170817, making this the first time ever that a machine learning method has been applied to search for a gravitational-wave signal from an isolated neutron star.

AB In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the mixture of experts (ME). We discuss the fundamental models for regression and classification and also their training with the expectation-maximization algorithm. We follow the discussion with improvements to the ME model and focus particularly on the mixtures of Gaussian process experts. We provide a review of the literature for other training methods, such as the alternative localized ME training, and cover the variational learning of ME in detail. In addition, we describe the model selection literature which encompasses finding the optimum number of experts, as well as the depth of the tree. We present the advances in ME in the classification area and present some issues concerning the classification model. We list the statistical properties of ME, discuss how the model has been modified over the years, compare ME to some popular algorithms, and list several applications. We conclude our survey with future directions and provide a list of publicly available datasets and a list of publicly available software that implement ME. Finally, we provide examples for regression and classification. We believe that the study described in this paper will provide quick access to the relevant literature for researchers and practitioners who would like to improve or use ME, and that it will stimulate further studies in ME.

AB Background: The primary objective of this study is to identify non-laboratory predictors for 30-day hospital readmission and 180-day in-hospital mortality rates among patients hospitalized with ischemic heart disease (IHD).
   Research design and methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized patients (>= 40 years) with a primary diagnosis of IHD. Data were extracted from the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration dataset from 2006 to 2016. A machine learning approach was used to identify predictors of 30-day hospital readmission and 180-day in-hospital mortality.
   Results: 346,390 patient records for incident IHD cases were identified. The top two predictors of 30-day readmission were the length of stay and the Elixhauser comorbidity index for readmission [ECI] (Area Under the Curve [AUC]=88%) using decision tree algorithms. For in-hospital mortality, the top two predictors were LOS and ECI (AUC=92%) using gradient boosting regressors. The cumulative 30-day readmission and the 180-day probability of mortality rates were 9.82% and 4.6% respectively.
   Conclusions: Risk factors of 30-day readmission and 180-day mortality in hospitalized IHD patients identified by machine learning and their relative importance (value) will help pharmacists and other health care providers to prioritize their disease management strategies as they improve the care provided to IHD patients.

AB Traffic emissions are a primary source of air pollution in urban areas, with air quality being influenced by different types of roads characterized by varying traffic volumes and speeds. Comprehending the distribution of air pollutants and the factors influencing it across different road types holds immense significance in endeavors to enhance air quality within urbanized regions. This study recorded concentrations of PM, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3 on different road types in Shenyang, China, using mobile monitoring. The impacts of road type and microclimatic factors on air quality were quantified using automated machine learning. Among the six road types, the suburban highway exhibited the highest PM, SO2, and NO2 pollution. On the other hand, secondary roads experienced the highest levels of CO and O3 pollution. The automated machine learning models provided accurate predictions for PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and O3 concentrations (R2 = 0.91, 0.83, 0.82, 0.83, 0.79, respectively). Relative humidity played the most significant role in PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations (55.93% and 59.39%, respectively), followed by air temperature (15.36% and 17.73%) and road types (14.28% and 8.74%). Road types contributed 24.33%, 20.60%, 16.61%, and 11.90% to SO2, CO, O3, and NO2 concentrations, respectively. Overall, this study addresses the limitations of previous research and provides a comprehensive understanding of the impact of road types on air pollutant concentrations in urban environments.

AB In the emerging field of mechanical metamaterials, using periodic lattice structures as a primary ingredient is relatively frequent. However, the choice of aperiodic lattices in these structures presents unique advantages regarding failure, e.g., buckling or fracture, because avoiding repeated patterns prevents global failures, with local failures occurring in turn that can beneficially delay structural collapse. Therefore, it is expedient to develop models for computing efficiently the effective mechanical properties in lattices from different general features while addressing the challenge of presenting topologies (or graphs) of different sizes. In this paper, we develop a deep learning model to predict energetically-equivalent mechanical properties of linear elastic lattices effectively. Considering the lattice as a graph and defining material and geometrical features on such, we show that Graph Neural Networks provide more accurate predictions than a dense, fully connected strategy, thanks to the geometrically induced bias through graph representation, closer to the underlying equilibrium laws from mechanics solved in the direct problem. Leveraging the efficient forward-evaluation of a vast number of lattices using this surrogate enables the inverse problem, i.e., to obtain a structure having prescribed specific behavior, which is ultimately suitable for multiscale structural optimization problems.

AB A new concept learning neural network is presented. This network builds correlation learning into a rule learning neural network where the certainty factor model of traditional expert systems is taken as the network activation function. The main argument for this approach is that correlation learning can help when the neural network fails to converge to the target concept due to insufficient or noisy training data. Both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation are provided to validate the system.

AB Background: Models that predict postoperative complications often ignore important intraoperative events and physiological changes. This study tested the hypothesis that accuracy, discrimination, and precision in predicting postoperative complications would improve when using both preoperative and intraoperative data input data compared with preoperative data alone.
   Methods: This retrospective cohort analysis included 43,943 adults undergoing 52,529 inpatient surgeries at a single institution during a 5-y period. Random forest machine learning models in the validated MySurgeryRisk platform made patient-level predictions for seven postoperative complications and mortality occurring during hospital admission using electronic health record data and patient neighborhood characteristics. For each outcome, one model trained with preoperative data alone; one model trained with both preoperative and intraoperative data. Models were compared by accuracy, discrimination (expressed as area under the receiver operating characteristic curve), precision (expressed as area under the precision-recall curve), and reclassification indices.
   Results: Machine learning models incorporating both preoperative and intraoperative data had greater accuracy, discrimination, and precision than models using preoperative data alone for predicting all seven postoperative complications (intensive care unit length of stay >48 h, mechanical ventilation >48 h, neurologic complications including delirium, cardiovascular complications, acute kidney injury, venous thromboembolism, and wound complications), and in-hospital mortality (accuracy: 88% versus 77%; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.93 versus 0.87; area under the precision-recall curve: 0.21 versus 0.15). Overall reclassification improvement was 2.4%-10.0% for compli-cations and 11.2% for in-hospital mortality.
   Conclusions: Incorporating both preoperative and intraoperative data significantly increased the accuracy, discrimination, and precision of machine learning models predicting post-operative complications and mortality. (c) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB One effective technique that has recently been considered for solving classification problems is parametric -support vector regression. This method obtains a concurrent learning framework for both margin determination and function approximation and leads to a convex quadratic programming problem. In this paper we introduce a new idea that converts this problem into an unconstrained convex problem. Moreover, we propose an extension of Newton's method for solving the unconstrained convex problem. We compare the accuracy and efficiency of our method with support vector machines and parametric -support vector regression methods. Experimental results on several UCI benchmark data sets indicate the high efficiency and accuracy of this method.

AB In this work we have analyzed a novel concept of sequential binding based learning capable network based on the coupling of recurrent units with Bayesian Prior definition. The coupling structure encodes to generate efficient tensor representations that can be decoded to generate efficient sentences and can describe certain events. These descriptions are derived from structural representations of visual features of images and media. An elaborated study of the different types of coupling recurrent structures are studied and some insights of their performance are provided. Supervised learning performance for natural language processing is judged based on statistical evaluations, however, the truth is perspective, and in this case the qualitative evaluations reveal the real capability of the different architectural strengths and variations. Bayesian Prior definition of different embedding helps in better characterization of the sentences based on the natural language structure related to parts of speech and other semantic level categorization in a form which is machine interpret-able and inherits the characteristics of the Tensor Representation binding and unbinding based on the mutually orthogonality. Our approach has surpassed some of the existing basic works related to image captioning.

AB We propose a novel nearest-neighbors approach to organize and curb the growth of radial basis function network in kernel adaptive filtering (KAF). The nearest-instance-centroid-estimation (NICE) kernel least-mean-square (KLMS) algorithm provides an appropriate time-space tradeoff with good performance. Its centers in the input/feature space are organized by quasi-orthogonal regions for greatly simplified filter evaluation. Instead of using all centers to evaluate/update the function approximation at every new point, a linear search among the iteratively-updated centroids determines the partial function to be used, naturally forming locally-supported partial functionals. Under this framework, partial functionals that compose the adaptive filter are quickly stored/retrieved based on input, each corresponding to a specialized "spatial-band" subfilter. The filter evaluation becomes the update of one of the subfilters, creating a content addressable filter bank (CAFB). This CAFB is incrementally updated for new signal applications with mild constraints, always using the past-learned partial filter sums, opening the door for transfer learning and significant efficiency for new data scenarios, avoiding training from scratch as have been done since the invention of adaptive filtering. Using energy conservation relation, we show the sufficient condition for mean square convergence of the NICE-KLMS algorithm and establish the upper and lower bounds of steady-state excess-mean-square-error (EMSE). Simulations on chaotic time-series prediction demonstrate similar levels of accuracy as existing methods, but with much faster computation involving fewer input samples. Simulations on transfer learning using both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that NICE CAFB can leverage previously learned knowledge to related task or domain.

AB Correntropy is a local similarity measure defined in kernel space, and the maximum correntropy criterion (mcc) has been successfully applied in many areas of signal processing and machine learning in recent years. The kernel function in correntropy is usually restricted to the Gaussian function with the center located at zero. However, the zero-mean Gaussian function may not be a good choice for many practical applications. In this letter, we propose an extended version of correntropy, whose center can be located at any position. Accordingly, we propose a new optimization criterion called maximum correntropy criterion with variable center (MCC-VC). We also propose an efficient approach to optimize the kernel width and center location in the MCC-VC. Simulation results of regression with linear-in-parameter (LIP) models confirm the desirable performance of the new method.

AB Mosquito-borne diseases account for human morbidity and mortality worldwide, caused by the parasites (e.g., malaria) or viruses (e.g., dengue, Zika) transmitted through bites of infected female mosquitoes. Globally, billions of people are at risk of infection, imposing significant economic and public health burdens. As such, efficient methods to monitor mosquito populations and prevent the spread of these diseases are at a premium. One proposed technique is to apply acoustic monitoring to the challenge of identifying wingbeats of individual mosquitoes. Although researchers have successfully used wingbeats to survey mosquito populations, implementation of these techniques in areas most affected by mosquito-borne diseases remains challenging. Here, methods utilizing easily accessible equipment and encouraging community-scientist participation are more likely to provide sufficient monitoring. We present a practical, community-science-based method of monitoring mosquito populations using smartphones. We applied deep-learning algorithms (TensorFlow Inception v3) to spectrogram images generated from smartphone recordings associated with six mosquito species to develop a multiclass mosquito identification system, and flag potential invasive vectors not present in our sound reference library. Though TensorFlow did not flag potential invasive species with high accuracy, it was able to identify species present in the reference library at an 85% correct identification rate, an identification rate markedly higher than similar studies employing expensive recording devices. Given that we used smartphone recordings with limited sample sizes, these results are promising. With further optimization, we propose this novel technique as a way to accurately and efficiently monitor mosquito populations in areas where doing so is most critical.

AB The combination of the famed kernel trick and the least-mean-square (LMS) algorithm provides an interesting sample-by-sample update for an adaptive filter in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), which is named in this paper the KLMS. Unlike the accepted view in kernel methods, this paper shows that in the finite training data case, the KLMS algorithm is well posed in RKHS without the addition of an extra regularization term to penalize solution norms as was suggested by Kivinen [Kivinen, Smola and Williamson, "Online Learning With Kernels," IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, vol. 52, no. 8, pp. 2165-2176, Aug. 2004] and Smale [Smale and Yao, "Online Learning Algorithms," Foundations in Computational Mathematics, vol. 6, no. 2, pp. 145-176, 2006]. This result is the main contribution of the paper and enhances the present understanding of the LMS algorithm with a machine learning perspective. The effect of the KLMS step size is also studied from the viewpoint of regularization. Two experiments are presented to support our conclusion that with finite data the KLMS algorithm can be readily used in high dimensional spaces and particularly in RKHS to derive nonlinear, stable algorithms with comparable performance to batch, regularized solutions.

AB Introduction The current diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) comorbidity with depression (DPD) largely depends on clinical evaluation. However, the modality may tend to lack precision in detecting PD with depression. A radiomic approach that combines functional connectivity and activity with clinical scores has the potential to achieve accurate and differential diagnosis between PD and DPD.
   Methods In this study, we aimed to employ the radiomic approach to extract large-scale features of functional connectivity and activity for differentiating among DPD, PD with no depression (NDPD), and healthy controls (HC). We extracted 6,557 features of five types from all subjects including clinical characteristics, resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC), amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC). Lasso, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM) were implemented for feature selection and dimension reduction based on the training sets, and the prediction performance for different methods in the testing sets was compared.
   Results The results showed that nineteen features were selected for the group of DPD versus HC, 34 features were selected for the group of NDPD versus HC, and 17 features were retained for the group of DPD versus NDPD. In the testing sets, Lasso prediction achieved the accuracies of 0.95, 0.96, and 0.85 for distinguishing between DPD and HC, NDPD and HC, and DPD and NDPD, respectively. Random forest achieved the accuracies of 0.90, 0.82, and 0.90 for distinguishing between DPD and HC, NDPD and HC, and DPD and NDPD, respectively, while SVM yielded the accuracies of 1, 0.86 and 0.65 for distinguishing between DPD and HC, NDPD and HC, and DPD and NDPD, respectively.
   Conclusions By identifying aberrant functional connectivity and activity as potential biomarkers, the radiomic approach facilitates a deeper understanding and provides new insights into the pathophysiology of DPD to support the clinical diagnosis with high prediction accuracy.

AB Smart speakers' voice recognition technology has not only advanced the efficiency of communication between users and machines, but also raised users' privacy concerns. As smart speakers listen to users' voice commands and collect audio data to improve algorithms, it is crucial to understand how users manage their privacy settings to protect personal information. Combining the uses and gratifications approach, the Media Equation, and communication privacy management theory, this study surveyed 991 participants' attitudes and behavior patterns related to smart speaker use. The study explored the unique gratifications that users seek, identified the main strategies that users adopt to manage their privacy, and suggested that users apply interpersonal privacy management rules to interactions with smart media. In addition, users' gratifications affect their privacy management via two routes: a protective route that highlights the role of perceived privacy risks, and a precautionary route that emphasizes the impact of users' social presence experiences.

AB Using a systematic literature search of original articles published during 2023 in Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (GIE) and other high-impact medical and gastroenterology journals, the GIE Editorial Board of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy compiled a list of the top 10 most significant topic areas in general and advanced GI endoscopy during the year. Each GIE Editorial Board member was directed to consider 3 criteria in generating candidate topics-significance, novelty, and impact on global clinical practice-and subject matter consensus was facilitated by the Chair through electronic voting and a meeting of the entire GIE Editorial Board. The 10 identified areas collectively represent advances in the following endoscopic spheres: GI bleeding, endohepatology, endoscopic palliation, artificial intelligence and polyp detection, artificial intelligence beyond the colon, better polypectomy and EMR, how to make endoscopy units greener, high-quality upper endoscopy, endoscopic tissue apposition and closure devices, and endoscopic submucosal dissection. Each board member was assigned a topic area around which to summarize relevant important articles, thereby generating this overview of the "top 10" endoscopic advances of 2023.

AB Existing models and methods report crop coefficient (K-c) as a function of time but do not consider the variations due to surface conditions, wetting methods, meteorological conditions, and other biophysical factors. These limitations result in erroneous crop evapotranspiration (ETc) estimates, especially for nonstandard conditions (e.g. plastic mulch). We present Support Vector Machine (SVM), a data-driven model based on statistical learning theory, for predicting generic K-c and ETc using a uniquely large dataset (10 seasons) from lysimeters for multiple crop-seasons combination under the plastic mulch conditions. The data used in this study were obtained from six years of lysimeter-based measurements (Shukla et al., 2006, 2012, 2014a, 2014b; Shukla and Knowles, 2011) for two distinctly different crop types (vine and erect) under two contrasting irrigation methods, drip and sub-irrigation. The SVM-based models predicted bell pepper (erect crop; r(2) =0.71) and watermelon (vine crop; r(2) =0.82) K-c as a function of time, water table depth, and number of rainfall events. The time since transplant represents the plant growth and, therefore, transpiration. The water table depth and rainfall events capture the effect of surface soil moisture on evaporation. The crop type-specific model is robust since it works for two different irrigation methods and growing seasons (spring and fall). The SVM model was superior to the Artificial Neural Network and Relevance Vector Machine models, two data-driven models used in hydrology. The errors in predicting ETc from the SVM model were only 2.6% and 11.2% for watermelon and bell pepper, respectively, highlighting the model accuracy. For both crops, the SVM predicted K-c values were not statistically different from the actual K-c values. In contrast, the FAO-56 values were significantly lower than the actual K-c values for both bell pepper (p = 0.016) and watermelon (p = 0.025). When evaluated in the context of watershed-scale budgets, the SVM model improved the accuracy in ETc estimates by 49.3 mm over the FAO-56 method, and this improvement represents 70% (70.7 mm) of the observed surface flow. Improved accuracy of the SVM model makes it useful in deriving local K-c using readily available hydro-climatic data for applications ranging from field-scale water management to watershed-scale modeling. The proposed model can be used to develop region-specific K-c to improve ETc estimates. Future efforts should be made to explore the development of similar models for open-field crops.

AB There are many intertwined factors such as urban fabric, vegetation combination, and meteorological conditions that influence the spatial distribution of fine particles (PM2.5, aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 mu m) in near -road urban areas, and it is difficult yet important to disentangle them. Identifying the relative importance of those factors could facilitate designing urban fabric and roadside vegetation combination patterns to mitigate the negative impacts of particles. This study first proposes an effective and reliable integrated method of the ENVI-met microclimate model and interpretable machine learning to quantify the multifactorial effects. Data from ENVI-met models with different built environments and meteorological conditions are used to train and test the machine learning (ML) models. All ML models show high accuracy in predicting PM2.5 concentrations with R2 high than 0.87. Results indicate that height level and study area are the two most important features, explaining 22.8% and 20.4% of the variation in PM2.5 concentration, respectively. The feature pairwise interactions account for 45.8% of ambient particle concentrations. The combination of trees and hedges in urban fabrics with longer building length than width could mitigate PM2.5 concentrations in residential areas. The integrated methods in this study could be extrapolated to future research to perform source identification analysis.

TI Using spatial video and deep learning for automated mapping of
   ground-level context in relief camps
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH GEOGRAPHICS

ID TORNADO
AB BackgroundThe creation of relief camps following a disaster, conflict or other form of externality often generates additional health problems. The density of people in a highly stressed environment with questionable safe food and water access presents the potential for infectious disease outbreaks. These camps are also not static data events but rather fluctuate in size, composition, and level and quality of service provision. While contextualized geospatial data collection and mapping are vital for understanding the nature of these camps, various challenges, including a lack of data at the required spatial or temporal granularity, as well as the issue of sustainability, can act as major impediments. Here, we present the first steps toward a deep learning-based solution for dynamic mapping using spatial video (SV).MethodsWe trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) model on a SV dataset collected from Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to identify relief camps from video imagery. We developed a spatial filtering approach to tackle the challenges associated with spatially tagging objects such as the accuracy of global positioning system and positioning of camera. The spatial filtering approach generates smooth surfaces of detection, which can further be used to capture changes in microenvironments by applying techniques such as raster math.ResultsThe initial results suggest that our model can detect temporary physical dwellings from SV imagery with a high level of precision, recall, and object localization. The spatial filtering approach helps to identify areas with higher concentrations of camps and the web-based tool helps to explore these areas. The longitudinal analysis based on applying raster math on the detection surfaces revealed locations, which had a considerable change in the distribution of tents over space and time.ConclusionsThe results lay the groundwork for automated mapping of spatial features from imagery data. We anticipate that this work is the building block for a future combination of SV, object identification and automatic mapping that could provide sustainable data generation possibilities for challenging environments such as relief camps or other informal settlements.

TI Surgeons' perspectives on artificial intelligence to support clinical

AB Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining traction in medicine and surgery. AI-based applications can offer tools to examine high-volume data to inform predictive analytics that supports complex decision-making processes. Time-sensitive trauma and emergency contexts are often challenging. The study aims to investigate trauma and emergency surgeons' knowledge and perception of using AI-based tools in clinical decision-making processes. Methods: An online survey grounded on literature regarding AI-enabled surgical decision-making aids was created by a multidisciplinary committee and endorsed by the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES). The survey was advertised to 917 WSES members through the society's website and Twitter profile. Results: 650 surgeons from 71 countries in five continents participated in the survey. Results depict the presence of technology enthusiasts and skeptics and surgeons' preference toward more classical decision-making aids like clinical guidelines, traditional training, and the support of their multidisciplinary colleagues. A lack of knowledge about several AI-related aspects emerges and is associated with mistrust. Discussion: The trauma and emergency surgical community is divided into those who firmly believe in the potential of AI and those who do not understand or trust AI-enabled surgical decision-making aids. Academic societies and surgical training programs should promote a foundational, working knowledge of clinical AI.

AB Vehicular communication has emerged as a powerful tool for providing a safe and comfortable driving experience for users. Long Term Evolution (LTE) supports and enhances the quality of vehicular communication due to its properties such as high data rate, spatial reuse, and low delay. However, high mobility of vehicles introduces a wide variety of security threats, including Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. In this paper, we propose effective solutions for real-time detection and localization of DoS attacks in an LTE-based vehicular network with mobile network components (e.g., vehicles, femto access points, etc.). We consider malicious data transmission by vehicles in two ways- using real identification (unintentional) and using fake identification (intentional). This paper makes three important contributions. First, we propose an efficient attack detection technique based on data packet counter and average Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR). Next, we present an improved attack detection framework using machine learning algorithms. We use some ML-based supervised classification algorithms to make detection more robust and consistent. Finally, we propose Data Packet Counter (DPC)-based, triangulation-based and measurement report based localization for both intentional and unintentional DoS attacks. We analyze the average packet delay incurred by vehicles by modelling the system as an M/M/m queue. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our proposed technique significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.

AB Purpose: To test the psychometric properties of a newly developed Mandarin Clinical Evaluation of Language for Preschooler's Core Scale (MCELP-CS).
   Methods: Data were collected from 379 preschool-aged participants, including 81 children with language disorders associated with clinical conditions. The 155-item MCELP-CS consists of five subscales: vocabulary comprehension (VC), sentence comprehension (SC), vocabulary naming (VN), sentence structure imitation (SSI), and story narration (SN). The scale was used to measure the receptive and expressive language abilities of children aged 3-5 years and 11 months. The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-revised (PPVT-R) was used to measure the receptive vocabulary abilities among the children (n = 338). The internal consistency, test-retest reliability, structural validity, convergent validity, and diagnostic accuracy were used to evaluate the scale. Differences between age groups were also examined using analysis of variance.
   Results: The MCELP-CS had high internal consistency and good test-retest reliability. Fitting indices of the two-factor model from confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), including chi(2), CFI, TLI, RSEAM, and SRMR, suggested that the model is consistent with the theoretical structure. Significant correlations between the MCELP-CS and PPVT-R showed a high convergent validity. In addition, the scale indicated good diagnostic accuracy in differentiating the language disorders of children with autism, cerebral palsy (CP), and hearing impairment (HI).
   Conclusions: The MCELP-CS is a reliable and valid diagnostic tool for language disorders of Mandarin-speaking preschool children with autism, CP, and HI. It is appropriate to collect normative data for the MCELP-CS with a large sample population of preschool children.

AB (Aim) COVID-19 is an ongoing infectious disease. It has caused more than 107.45 m confirmed cases and 2.35 m deaths till 11/Feb/2021. Traditional computer vision methods have achieved promising results on the automatic smart diagnosis. (Method) This study aims to propose a novel deep learning method that can obtain better performance. We use the pseudo-Zernike moment (PZM), derived from Zernike moment, as the extracted features. Two settings are introducing: (i) image plane over unit circle; and (ii) image plane inside the unit circle. Afterward, we use a deep-stacked sparse autoencoder (DSSAE) as the classifier. Besides, multiple-way data augmentation is chosen to overcome overfitting. The multiple-way data augmentation is based on Gaussian noise, salt-and-pepper noise, speckle noise, horizontal and vertical shear, rotation, Gamma correction, random translation and scaling. (Results) 10 runs of 10-fold cross validation shows that our PZM-DSSAE method achieves a sensitivity of 92.06% +/- 1.54%, a specificity of 92.56% +/- 1.06%, a precision of 92.53% +/- 1.03%, and an accuracy of 92.31% +/- 1.08%. Its F1 score, MCC, and FMI arrive at 92.29% +/- 1.10%, 84.64% +/- 2.15%, and 92.29% +/- 1.10%, respectively. The AUC of our model is 0.9576. (Conclusion) We demonstrate "image plane over unit circle" can get better results than "image plane inside a unit circle." Besides, this proposed PZM-DSSAE model is better than eight state-of-the-art approaches.

TI TDAExplore: Quantitative analysis of fluorescence microscopy images
   through topology-based machine learning
SO PATTERNS

AB Recent advances in machine learning have greatly enhanced automatic methods to extract information from fluorescence microscopy data. However, current machine-learning-based models can require hundreds to thousands of images to train, and the most readily accessible models classify images without describing which parts of an image contributed to classification. Here, we introduce TDAExplore, a machine learning image analysis pipeline based on topological data analysis. It can classify different types of cellular perturbations after training with only 20-30 high-resolution images and performs robustly on images from multiple subjects and microscopy modes. Using only images and whole-image labels for training, TDAExplore provides quantitative, spatial information, characterizing which image regions contribute to classification. Computational requirements to train TDAExplore models are modest and a standard PC can perform training with minimal user input. TDAExplore is therefore an accessible, powerful option for obtaining quantitative information about imaging data in a wide variety of applications.

AB Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) is a fundamental connected vehicle application. In CACC, a vehicle coordinates its longitudinal movements to safely and efficiently follow the vehicle in front. The follower vehicle relies on a combination of sensory and communication inputs to identify the position, velocity, and acceleration of the preceding vehicle. Malicious subversion of these inputs can cause catastrophic accidents, string instability, and disruption in the transportation infrastructure. In this paper, we develop a security system, RECAP , to provide real-time resiliency in CACC against adversarial subversion of both sensory and communication inputs. RECAP makes use of a combination of techniques based on kinematics and machine learning to detect anomalous inputs, narrow down the source of subversion, and perform mitigation. We provide extensive simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of RECAP against a diverse spectrum of attacks under complex, multi-channel adversaries.

ID FLOW; DISINFECTION; PERFORMANCE; MODEL
AB Clarification basins are ubiquitous water treatment units applied across urban water systems. Diverse applications include stormwater systems, stabilization lagoons, equalization, storage and green infrastructure. Residence time (RT), surface overflow rate (SOR) and the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) are readily implemented but are not formulated to optimize basin geometrics because transport dynamics remain unresolved. As a result, basin design yields high costs from hundreds of thousands to tens of million USD. Basin optimization and retrofits can benefit from more robust and efficient tools. More advanced methods such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD), while demonstrating benefits for resolving transport, can be complex and computationally expensive for routine applications. To provide stakeholders with an efficient and robust tool, this study develops a novel optimization framework for basin geometrics with machine learning (ML). This framework (1) leverages high-performance computing (HPC) and the predictive capability of CFD to provide artificial neural network (ANN) development and (2) integrates a trained ANN model with a hybrid evolutionary-gradient-based optimization algorithm through the ANN automatic differentiation (AD) functionality. ANN model results for particulate matter (PM) clarification demonstrate high predictive capability with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.998 on the test dataset. The ANN model for total PM clarification of three (3) heterodisperse particle size distributions (PSDs) also illustrates good performance (R2 > 0.986). The proposed framework was implemented for a basin and watershed loading conditions in Florida (USA), the ML basin designs yield substantially improved cost-effectiveness compared to common designs (square and circular basins) and RT-based design for all PSDs tested. To meet a presumptive regulatory criteria of 80% PM separation (widely adopted in the USA), the ML framework yields 4.7X to 8X lower cost than the common basin designs tested. Compared to the RT-based design, the ML design yields 5.6X to 83.5X cost reduction as a function of the finer, medium, and coarser PSDs. Furthermore, the proposed framework benefits from ANN's high computational efficiency. Optimization of basin geometrics is performed in minutes on a laptop using the framework. The framework is a promising adjuvant tool for cost-effective and sustainable basin implementation across urban water systems.

AB Huanglongbing (HLB) is a highly destructive disease that inflicts significant economic losses on the citrus industry worldwide but with no cure available. However, microbiomes formulated by citrus plants may serve as disease antagonists, increasing the level of HLB tolerance. This study established an integrated analysis of untargeted metabolomics and microbiomics data for different citrus cultivars, providing critical insights into the interactions between plant metabolism and plant-associated bacteria in the development of HLB. Machine learning models were applied to screen important metabolites and bacteria in multiple citrus materials, and the selected metabolites were then analyzed to identify essential pathways enriched in the plant and to correlate with the selected bacteria. Results demonstrated that the regulation of plant pathways, especially ABC transporters and ubiquinone and other terpene-ubiquinone biosynthesis pathways, could affect the microbial community structure, indicating potential solutions for controlling HLB by modulating bacteria in citrus plants or breeding tolerant citrus cultivars.

AB Hardware Trojans are malicious modifications in integrated circuits (ICs) with an intent to breach security and compromise the reliability of an electronic system. This article proposes a framework using self-testing, advanced imaging, and image processing with machine learning to detect hardware Trojans inserted by untrusted foundries. It includes on-chip test structures with negligible power, delay, and silicon area overheads. The core step of the framework is on-chip golden circuit design, which can provide authentic samples for image-based Trojan detection through self-testing. This core step enables a golden-chip-free Trojan detection that does not rely on an existing image data set from Trojan-free chip or image synthesizing. We have conducted an in-depth analysis of detection steps and discussed possible attacks with countermeasures to strengthen this framework. The performance evaluation on a 28-nm FPGA and a 90-nm IC validates its high accuracy and reliability for practical applications.

ID SELECTION
AB Early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) during the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) stage could enable effective intervention to slow down disease progression. Computer-aided diagnosis of AD relies on a sufficient amount of biomarker data. When this requirement is not fulfilled, transfer learning can be used to transfer knowledge from a source domain with more amount of labeled data than available in the desired target domain. In this study, an instance-based transfer learning framework is presented based on the gradient boosting machine (GBM). In GBM, a sequence of base learners is built, and each learner focuses on the errors (residuals) of the previous learner. In our transfer learning version of GBM (TrGB), a weighting mechanism based on the residuals of the base learners is defined for the source instances. Consequently, instances with different distribution than the target data will have a lower impact on the target learner. The proposed weighting scheme aims to transfer as much information as possible from the source domain while avoiding negative transfer. The target data in this study was obtained from the Mount Sinai dataset which is collected and processed in a collaborative 5-year project at the Mount Sinai Medical Center. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset was used as the source domain. The experimental results showed that the proposed TrGB algorithm could improve the classification accuracy by 1.5 and 4.5% for CN vs. MCI and multiclass classification, respectively, as compared to the conventional methods. Also, using the TrGB model and transferred knowledge from the CN vs. AD classification of the source domain, the average score of early MCI vs. late MCI classification improved by 5%.

AB Nutrient pollution caused by excessive total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) is a significant environmental challenge globally, threatening water quality and ecosystem health. This study investigates the interplay between rainfall, topography, and human disturbances in shaping TN and TP dynamics, aiming to identify critical factors driving nutrient pollution. Using integrated machine learning and statistical approaches, including Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), and logistic regression, the study reveals that rainfall acts as a dominant dilution factor, reducing nutrient concentrations and explaining 72.8% of TN variance and 55.6% of TP variance. Conversely, steep slopes and human-disturbed land use are positively correlated with nutrient levels but are moderated by rainfall's mitigating effect. Logistic regression further confirms rainfall's predictive significance, achieving high classification accuracy for TN (AUC = 0.82) and TP (AUC = 0.76). The identification of Critical Source Areas (CSAs) highlights priority regions for intervention, demonstrating the utility of the proposed framework for targeting water quality improvement measures. By integrating spatial and statistical modeling, this study provides actionable solutions and contributes to advancing water quality management strategies through enhanced understanding of natural and anthropogenic influences on nutrient pollution.

ID SELECTION
AB Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and the leading cause of dementia. Early diagnosis is critical for patients to benefit from potential intervention and treatment. The retina has emerged as a plausible diagnostic site for AD detection owing to its anatomical connection with the brain. However, existing AI models for this purpose have yet to provide a rational explanation behind their decisions and have not been able to infer the stage of the disease's progression. Along this direction, we propose a novel model-agnostic explainable-AI framework, called Granular Neuron-level Explainer (LAVA), an interpretation prototype that probes into intermediate layers of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to directly assess the continuum of AD from the retinal imaging without the need for longitudinal or clinical evaluations. This innovative approach aims to validate retinal vasculature as a biomarker and diagnostic modality for evaluating Alzheimer's Disease. Leveraged UK Biobank cognitive tests and vascular morphological features demonstrate significant promise and effectiveness of LAVA in identifying AD stages across the progression continuum.

AB Simple Summary Endometrial cancer and mixed M & uuml;llerian tumors are different types of uterine malignancies, yet differentiating these diseases can be challenging and often requires surgery. A timely and accurate diagnosis of these conditions is crucial for providing optimal treatment options. The emerging field of radiomics may assist clinicians in diagnosing these conditions preoperatively by extracting complex patterns from clinical imaging to identify features unique to each type of tumor. This study aims to analyze radiomics data from patients with endometrial cancer and mixed M & uuml;llerian tumors to identify distinguishing features that could help clinicians diagnose each disease.Abstract The objective of this study was to compare the quantitative radiomics data between malignant mixed M & uuml;llerian tumors (MMMTs) and endometrial carcinoma (EC) and identify texture features associated with overall survival (OS). This study included 61 patients (36 with EC and 25 with MMMTs) and analyzed various radiomic features and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features. These variables and patient clinicopathologic characteristics were compared between EC and MMMTs using the Wilcoxon Rank sum and Fisher's exact test. The area under the curve of the receiving operating characteristics (AUC ROC) was calculated for univariate analysis in predicting EC status. Logistic regression with elastic net regularization was performed for texture feature selection. This study showed that skewness (p = 0.045) and tumor volume (p = 0.007) significantly differed between EC and MMMTs. The range of cluster shade, the angular variance of cluster shade, and the range of the sum of squares variance were significant predictors of EC status (p <= 0.05). The regularized Cox regression analysis identified the "256 Angular Variance of Energy" texture feature as significantly associated with OS independently of the EC/MMMT grouping (p = 0.004). The volume and texture features of the tumor region may help distinguish between EC and MMMTs and predict patient outcomes.

AB In this paper, multiple instance learning (MIL) algorithms to automatically perform root detection and segmentation in minirhizotron imagery using only image-level labels are proposed. Root and soil characteristics vary from location to location, and thus, supervised machine learning approaches that are trained with local data provide the best ability to identify and segment roots in minirhizotron imagery. However, labeling roots for training data (or otherwise) is an extremely tedious and time-consuming task. This paper aims to address this problem by labeling data at the image level (rather than the individual root or root pixel level) and train algorithms to perform individual root pixel level segmentation using MIL strategies. Three MIL methods (multiple instance adaptive cosine coherence estimator, multiple instance support vector machine, multiple instance learning with randomized trees) were applied to root detection and compared to non-MIL approaches. The results show that MIL methods improve root segmentation in challenging minirhizotron imagery and reduce the labeling burden. In our results, multiple instance support vector machine outperformed other methods. The multiple instance adaptive cosine coherence estimator algorithm was a close second with an added advantage that it learned an interpretable root signature which identified the traits used to distinguish roots from soil and did not require parameter selection.

ID CHALLENGES
AB Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), e.g., drones, have become crucial assets in the military's fleet of vehicles. UAVs can provide limited bandwidth for tactical communications and can act as relays over battlefields. Modern drones provide much higher bandwidth than their legacy predecessors with dynamic antenna capabilities that would be useful in communicating around obstacles, such as urban corridors formed by rows of tall buildings that limit terrestrial lines of sight and attenuate high frequencies. While it is still more likely that one UAV is used for this purpose, a well-managed cluster of UAVs could increase the functionality of the entire terrestrial-drone network. Software-defined networking (SDN) is recognized as an effective way to manage distributed wireless networks. In our previous research, we used a software-defined UAV (SD-UAV) network to offer organized and secure communication resources and relaying capabilities to soldiers, military vehicles, and assets on the ground in a signal-challenged urban environment. Additionally, we developed a framework for detecting common multiple types of cyberattacks (black hole, gray hole, and jamming) using the Light Gradient Boosting machine learning algorithm. However, zero-day attacks are newly developed cyberattacks that can cause significant harm to the functionality of a SD-UAV network. Due to the novelty of these attacks, there is a lack of data samples for ML model training and testing. In order to tackle this problem, this paper provides a predictive queuing analysis of a SD-UAV network. To our knowledge, no previous work has proposed using queuing analysis to predict network performance statistics of SD-UAV networks for the purpose of enhancing security against zero-day cyberattacks. This analysis allows the network operator to calculate the expected theoretical values of the average interarrival time, transmission delay, and packet count of each SD-UAV in a swarm under normal, non-attack operating conditions. This allows the network operator to establish a normal baseline for ML training in order to compare and detect zero-day attacks by detecting any malicious or abnormal SD-UAV network behavior. In this study, we conduct an analysis, simulation, and discussion of the results of our predictive queuing analysis. Our simulation results confirm the accuracy of our predictive queuing analysis we obtained for the average interarrival times, transmission delay, and packet count for the SD-UAVs in the swarm. Our predictive queuing analysis enables the network operator to predict network performance statistics of the SD-UAVs for the purpose of enhancing security against zero-day cyberattacks.

AB Creating dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) that mimic natural muscle has proven difficult, as a DEA provides in-plane expansion when actuated, while natural muscle creates contraction upon stimulation. Using a composite fiber-mesh dielectric, a DEA can create planar contraction when compressed through the thickness due to reorientation of the fiber reinforcement. This letter investigates the performance of a fiber-reinforced dielectric elastomer tension actuator (FRDETA) under a variety of loading conditions. We present modeling that considers the extensibility and packing density of the embedded fiber reinforcement to predict the mechanical response of the actuator. We then experimentally validate the results and determine the optimal fiber angle to maximize mechanical work for a FRDETA under a dead load. The FRDETAs tested were able to obtain tensile stresses of 880 kPa, tensile strains up to 14.7%, and a mass-specific energy density of 10.7 ,l/kg, which all fall within the ranges reported for natural muscle. Overall, these tensile actuators present an easily implementable solution for creating tension in larger soft robotic systems.

AB SATCOM is crucial for tactical networks, particularly submarines with sporadic communication requirements. Emerging SATCOM technologies, such as low-earth-orbit (LEO) satellite networks, provide lower latency, greater data reliability, and higher throughput than long-distance geostationary (GEO) satellites. Software-defined networking (SDN) has been introduced to SATCOM networks due to its ability to enhance management while strengthening network control and security. In our previous work, we proposed a SD-LEO constellation for naval submarine communication networks, as well as an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine-learning (ML) approach for classifying denial-of-service attacks against the constellation. Nevertheless, zero-day attacks have the potential to cause major damage to the SATCOM network, particularly the controller architecture, due to the scarcity of data for training and testing ML models due to their novelty. This study tackles this challenge by employing a predictive queuing analysis of the SD-SATCOM controller design to rapidly generate ML training data for zero-day attack detection. In addition, we redesign our singular controller architecture to a decentralized controller architecture to eliminate singular points of failure. To our knowledge, no prior research has investigated using queuing analysis to predict SD-SATCOM controller architecture network performance for ML training to prevent zero-day attacks. Our queuing analysis accelerates the training of ML models and enhances data adaptability, enabling network operators to defend against zero-day attacks without precollected data. We utilized the CatBoost algorithm to train a multi-output regression model to predict network performance statistics. Our method successfully identified and classified normal, non-attack samples and zero-day cyberattacks with over 94% accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-scores.

AB Accelerometer-based fitness trackers and smartwatches are proliferating with incessant attention towards health tracking. Despite their growing popularity, accurately measuring hallmark measures of physical activities has yet to be accomplished in adults of all ages. In this work, we evaluated the performance of four machine learning models: decision tree, random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), to estimate the hallmark measures of physical activities in young (20-50 years), middle-aged (50-70 years], and older adults (70-89 years]. Our models were built to recognize physical activity types, recognize physical activity intensities, estimate energy expenditure (EE) and recognize individual physical activities using wrist-worn tri-axial accelerometer data (33 activities per participant) from a large sample of participants (n = 253, 62% women, aged 20-89 years old). Results showed that the machine learning models were quite accurate at recognizing physical activity type and intensity and estimating energy expenditure. However, models performed less optimally when recognizing individual physical activities. F1-Scores derived from XGBoost's models were high for sedentary (0.955-0.973), locomotion (0.942-0.964) and lifestyle (0.913-0.949) activity types with no apparent difference across age groups. Low (0.919-0.947), light (0.813-0.828) and moderate (0.846-0.875) physical activity intensities were also recognized accurately. The root mean square error range for EE was approximately 1 equivalent of resting EE [0.835-1.009 METs]. Generally, random forest and XGBoost models outperformed other models. In conclusion, machine learning models to label physical activity types, activity intensity and energy expenditure are accurate and there are minimal differences in their performance across young, middle-aged and older adults.

AB Introduction The continual evolution of dental education, dental practice and the delivery of optimal oral health care is rooted in the practice of leadership. This paper explores opportunities and challenges facing dental education with a specific focus on incorporating the use of artificial intelligence (AI). Methods Using the model in Bolman and Deal's Reframing Organizations, the Four Frames model serves as a road map for building infrastructure within dental schools for the adoption of AI. Conclusion AI can complement and boost human tasks and have a far-reaching impact in academia and health care. Its adoption could enhance educational experiences and the delivery of care, and support current functions and future innovation. The framework suggested in this paper, while specific to AI, could be adapted and applied to a myriad of innovations and new organizational ideals and goals within institutions of dental education.

AB Concerning power systems, real-time monitoring of cyber-physical security, false data injection attacks on wide-area measurements are of major concern. However, the database of the network parameters is just as crucial to the state estimation process. Maintaining the accuracy of the system model is the other part of the equation, since almost all applications in power systems heavily depend on the state estimator outputs. While much effort has been given to measurements of false data injection attacks, seldom reported work is found on the broad theme of false data injection on the database of network parameters. State-of-the-art physics-based model solutions correct false data injection on network parameter database considering only available wide-area measurements. In addition, deterministic models are used for correction. In this paper, an overdetermined physics-based parameter false data injection correction model is presented. The overdetermined model uses a parameter database correction Jacobian matrix and a Taylor series expansion approximation. The method further applies the concept of synthetic measurements, which refers to measurements that do not exist in the real-life system. A machine learning linear regression-based model for measurement prediction is integrated in the framework through deriving weights for synthetic measurements creation. Validation of the presented model is performed on the IEEE 118-bus system. Numerical results show that the approximation error is lower than the state-of-the-art, while providing robustness to the correction process. Easy-to-implement model on the classical weighted-least-squares solution, highlights real-life implementation potential aspects.

AB Introduction: To predict acute kidney injury (AKI) risk in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) prescribed sodium-glucose cotransporter two inhibitors (SGLT2i).Methods: Using a 5% random sample of Medicare claims data, we identified 17,694 patients who filled >= 1 prescriptions for canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin in 2013-2016. The cohort was split randomly and equally into training and testing sets. We measured 65 predictor candidates using claims data from the year prior to SGLT2i initiation. We then applied three machine learning models, including random forests (RF), elastic net and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) for risk prediction.Results: The incidence rate of AKI was 1.1% over a median 1.5 year follow up. Among three machine learning methods, RF produced the best prediction (C-statistic = 0.72), followed by LASSO and elastic net (both C-statistics = 0.69). Among individuals classified in the top 10% of the RF risk score (i.e., high risk group), the actual incidence rate of AKI was as high as 3.7%. In the logistic regression model including 14 important risk factors selected by LASSO, use of loop diuretics [adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 3.72 (2.44-5.76)] had the strongest association with AKI incidence.Disscusion: Our machine learning model efficiently identified patients at risk of AKI among Medicare beneficiaries with T2D undergoing SGLT2i treatment.

AB There is a paucity of predictive models for uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. The present study applied different machine learning algorithms on multiple patient characteristics to predict uncontrolled diabetes. Patients with diabetes above the age of 18 from the All of Us Research Program were included. Random forest, extreme gradient boost, logistic regression, and weighted ensemble model algorithms were employed. Patients who had a record of uncontrolled diabetes based on the international classification of diseases code were identified as cases. A set of features including basic demographic, biomarkers and hematological indices were included in the model. The random forest model demonstrated high performance in predicting uncontrolled diabetes, yielding an accuracy of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.79-0.81) as compared to the extreme gradient boost 0.74 (95% CI: 0.73-0.75), the logistic regression 0.64 (95% CI: 0.63-0.65) and the weighted ensemble model 0.77 (95% CI: 0.76-0.79). The maximum area under the receiver characteristics curve value was 0.77 (random forest model), while the minimum value was 0.7 (logistic regression model). Potassium levels, body weight, aspartate aminotransferase, height, and heart rate were important predictors of uncontrolled diabetes. The random forest model demonstrated a high performance in predicting uncontrolled diabetes. Serum electrolytes and physical measurements were important features in predicting uncontrolled diabetes. Machine learning techniques may be used to predict uncontrolled diabetes by incorporating these clinical characteristics.

AB Resource-constrained classification tasks are common in real-world applications such as allocating tests for disease diagnosis, hiring decisions when filling a limited number of positions, and defect detection in manufacturing settings under a limited inspection budget. Typical classification algorithms treat the learning process and the resource constraints as two separate and sequential tasks. We develop an adaptive learning approach that considers resource constraints and learning jointly by iteratively fine-tuning misclassification costs. Via a structured experimental study using a publicly available data set, we evaluate a decision tree classifier that utilizes the proposed approach. The adaptive learning approach performs significantly better than alternative approaches, especially for difficult classification problems in which the performance of common approaches may be unsatisfactory. The suggested approach reaches similar classification decisions for different costs, thus it may be useful when misclassification costs are not known precisely or are costly to achieve. We envision the suggested learning approach as an important addition to the repertoire of techniques for handling resource-constrained classification problems.

ID GAMES
AB Previous research in reverse auction B2B exchanges found that in an environment where sellers collectively can cater to the total demand, with the final (i.e. the highest-priced bidding) seller catering to a residual, the sellers resort to a mixed strategy equilibrium [2]. While price randomization in industrial bids is an accepted norm, it may be argued that managers in reality do not resort to advanced game theoretic calculations to bid for an order. What is more likely is that managers learn that strategy and over time finally converge towards the theoretic equilibrium. To test this assertion, we model the two-player game in a synthetic environment, where the agents use a simple reinforcement learning algorithm to put progressively more weights on selecting price bands where they make higher profits. We find that after a sufficient number of iterations, the agents do indeed converge towards the theoretic equilibrium.

ID IDENTIFICATION
AB In this study, an innovative odor imaging system capable of detecting adulteration in quince seed edible oils mixed with sunflower oil and sesame oil based on their volatile organic compound (VOC) profiles was developed. The system comprises a colorimetric sensor array (CSA), a data acquisition unit, and a machine learning algorithm for identifying adulterants. The CSA was created using a method that involves applying a mixture of six different pH indicators (methyl violet, chlorophenol red, Nile blue, methyl orange, alizarin, cresol red) onto a Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) silica gel plate. Subsequently, difference maps were generated by subtracting the "initial" image from the "final" image, with the resulting color changes being converted into digital data, which were then further analyzed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Following this, a Support Vector Machine was employed to scrutinize quince seed oil that had been adulterated with varying proportions of sunflower oil and sesame oil. The classifier was progressively supplied with an increasing number of principal components (PCs), starting from one and incrementally increasing up to five. Each time, the classifier was optimized to determine the hyperparameters utilizing a random search algorithm. With one to five PCs, the classification error accounted for a range of 37.18% to 1.29%. According to the results, this novel system is simple, cost-effective, and has potential applications in food quality control and consumer protection.

AB The paper proposes and evaluates an artificial neural network based method of modeling the dynamic behavior of continua. The technique is applicable to situations where the differential equations governing the behavior of a system are nonlinear and poorly understood, and the data available for training is noisy. A method of modeling the unknown component of governing differential equations using neural network technology, is first described. This includes a method for averaging out localized errors in the neural network function that results from noise in the training data. A description is then given of a radial-Gaussian neural network architecture and training algorithm adopted for this application The construction of a complete simulation model of a specific system from the trained neural networks is demonstrated. The performance of the proposed approach is assessed in a series of experiments simulating the nonlinear thermal behavior of a translucent solid material. The system is proven to perform most effectively using the proposed error averaging technique, and to be capable of providing an accurate simulation of a system's behavior sustained over many thousands of simulation time steps.

AB BACKGROUND Over the past decade, several studies have shown that potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in dermatology. However, there has yet to be a systematic review evaluating the usage of AI specifically within the field of Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS). OBJECTIVE In this review, we aimed to comprehensively evaluate the current state, efficacy, and future implications of AI when applied to MMS for the treatment of nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSC). MATERIALS AND METHODS A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted following PRISMA guidelines across several databases, including PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane libraries. A predefined protocol was registered in PROSPERO, with literature search involving specific keywords related to AI and Mohs surgery for NMSC. RESULTS From 23 studies evaluated, our results find that AI shows promise as a prediction tool for precisely identifying NMSC in tissue sections during MMS. Furthermore, high AUC and concordance values were also found across the various usages of AI in MMS, including margin control, surgical recommendations, similarity metrics, and in the prediction of stage and construction complexity. CONCLUSION The findings of this review suggest promising potential for AI to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of Mohs surgery, particularly for NMSC.

DT Article
AB This paper deals with the role of neural-network based prediction for the modeling of nonlinear dynamical systems. We show experimentally that the backpropagation learning rule to train neural networks and the prediction error, so widely utilized in teaching and comparing nonlinear predictors, do not consistently indicate that the neural network based model has indeed captured the dynamics of the system that produced the time series. Frequently, but not always, the neural network when used as an autonomous system in a feedback configuration was able to generate a time series that has dynamical invariants similar to the original time series. We show that the estimation of the dynamical invariants (correlation dimension, largest Lyapunov exponent) of the predicted and original time series are an appropriate tool to validate the predictive model.

AB Introduction: The aim of the present systematic review (SR) is to summarize Machine Learning (ML) models currently used to predict head and neck cancer (HNC) treatment-related toxicities, and to understand the impact of image biomarkers (IBMs) in prediction models (PMs). The present SR was conducted following the guidelines of the PRISMA 2022 and registered in PROSPERO database (CRD42020219304). Methods: The acronym PICOS was used to develop the focused review question (Can PMs accurately predict HNC treatment toxicities?) and the eligibility criteria. The inclusion criteria enrolled Prediction Model Studies (PMSs) with patient cohorts that were treated for HNC and developed toxicities. Electronic database search encompassed PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, LILACS, and Gray Literature (Google Scholar and ProQuest). Risk of Bias (RoB) was assessed through PROBAST and the results were synthesized based on the data format (with and without IBMs) to allow comparison. Results: A total of 28 studies and 4,713 patients were included. Xerostomia was the most frequently investigated toxicity (17; 60.71 %). Sixteen (57.14 %) studies reported using radiomics features in combination with clinical or dosimetrics/dosiomics for modelling. High RoB was identified in 23 studies. Meta-analysis (MA) showed an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0.82 for models with IBMs and 0.81 for models without IBMs (p value < 0.001), demonstrating no difference among IBM-and non-IBM-based models. Discussion: The development of a PM based on sample-specific features represents patient selection bias and may affect a model's performance. Heterogeneity of the studies as well as non-standardized metrics prevent proper comparison of studies, and the absence of an independent/external test does not allow the evaluation of the model's generalization ability. Conclusion: IBM-featured PMs are not superior to PMs based on non-IBM predictors. The evidence was appraised as of low certainty.

AB Peptide epitopes mediate as many as 40% of protein- protein interactions and fulfill signaling, inhibition, and activation roles within the cell. Beyond protein recognition, some peptides can self-or coassemble into stable hydrogels, making them a readily available source of biomaterials. While these 3D assemblies are routinely characterized at the fiber level, there are missing atomistic details about the assembly scaffold. Such atomistic detail can be useful in the rational design of more stable scaffold structures and with improved accessibility to functional motifs. Computational approaches can in principle reduce the experimental cost of such an endeavor by predicting the assembly scaffold and identifying novel sequences that adopt said structure. Yet, inaccuracies in physical models and inefficient sampling have limited atomistic studies to short (two or three amino acid) peptides. Given recent developments in machine learning and advances in sampling strategies, we revisit the suitability of physical models for this task. We use the MELD (Modeling Employing Limited Data) approach to drive self-assembly in combination with generic data in cases where conventional MD is unsuccessful. Finally, despite recent developments in machine learning algorithms for protein structure and sequence predictions, we find the algorithms are not yet suited for studying the assembly of short peptides.

AB A major development in knowledge-based neural networks is the integration of symbolic expert rule-based knowledge into neural networks, resulting in so-called rule-based neural (or connectionist) networks. An expert network here refers to a particular construct in which the uncertainty management model of symbolic expert systems is mapped into the activation function of the neural network. This paper addresses a yet-to-be-answered question: Why can expert networks generalize more effectively from a finite number of training instances than multilayer perceptrons? It formally shows that expert networks reduce generalization dimensionality and require relatively small sample sizes for correct generalization.

ID VEGETATION
AB Floods are one of the most wide-spread, frequent, and devastating natural disasters that continue to increase in frequency and intensity. Remote sensing, specifically synthetic aperture radar (SAR), has been widely used to detect surface water inundation to provide retrospective and near-real time (NRT) information due to its high-spatial resolution, self-illumination, and low atmospheric attenuation. However, the efficacy of flood inundation mapping with SAR is susceptible to reflections and scattering from a variety of factors including dense vegetation and urban areas. In this study, the topographic dataset Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) was investigated as a potential supplement to Sentinel-1A C-Band SAR along with supervised machine learning to improve the detection of inundation in heterogeneous areas. Three machine learning classifiers were trained on two sets of features dual-polarized SAR only and dual-polarized SAR along with HAND to map inundated areas. Three study sites along the Neuse River in North Carolina, USA during the record flood of Hurricane Matthew in October 2016 were selected. The binary classification analysis (inundated as positive vs. non-inundated as negative) revealed significant improvements when incorporating HAND in several metrics including classification accuracy (ACC) (+36.0%), critical success index (CSI) (+39.95%), true positive rate (TPR) (+42.02%), and negative predictive value (NPV) (+17.26%). A marginal change of +0.15% was seen for positive predictive value (PPV), but true negative rate (TNR) fell -14.4%. By incorporating HAND, a significant number of areas with high SAR backscatter but low HAND values were detected as inundated which increased true positives. This in turn also increased the false positives detected but to a lesser extent as evident in the metrics. This study demonstrates that HAND could be considered a valuable feature to enhance SAR flood inundation mapping especially in areas with heterogeneous land covers with dense vegetation that interfere with SAR.

AB The global citrus industry faces a great threat from Huanglongbing (HLB), a destructive disease caused by 'Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus' (CLas) that induces significant economic losses without any known cure. Understanding how citrus plants defend against HLB, particularly at the early stages of infection, is crucial for developing long-term solutions. This study investigated the earliest metabolic responses of fresh citrus leaves to CLas infection using untargeted metabolomics and machine learning models. HLB-tolerant and HLB-sensitive cultivars were compared to analyze their biochemical reactions within 48 hours post-infection. HESI/Q-Orbitrap MS analysis identified temporal differential metabolites, revealing distinct metabolic pathways activated in response to CLas infection. Both cultivars responded by increasing specific metabolite concentrations, such as flavonoids, within 2 hours post-infection, but the HLB-tolerant cultivar maintained higher levels throughout the 48-hour period. This early metabolic activity could influence long-term plant health by enhancing disease resistance and reducing pathogen impact. These findings provide potential biomarkers for breeding HLB-resistant cultivars and offer valuable insights for developing sustainable management strategies to mitigate the impact of HLB on the citrus industry, ensuring its long-term productivity and economic viability.

ID MALICIOUS DATA ATTACK; PHYSICAL SECURITY; MODEL
AB Communication networks in power systems are a major part of the smart grid paradigm. It enables and facilitates the automation of power grid operation as well as self-healing in contingencies. Such dependencies on communication networks, though, create a roam for cyber-threats. An adversary can launch an attack on the communication network, which in turn reflects on power grid operation. Attacks could be in the form of false data injection into system measurements, flooding the communication channels with unnecessary data, or intercepting messages. Using machine learning-based processing on data gathered from communication networks and the power grid is a promising solution for detecting cyber threats. In this paper, a co-simulation of cyber-security for cross-layer strategy is presented. The advantage of such a framework is the augmentation of valuable data that enhances the detection as well as identification of anomalies in the operation of the power grid. The framework is implemented on the IEEE 118-bus system. The system is constructed in Mininet to simulate a communication network and obtain data for analysis. A distributed three controller software-defined networking (SDN) framework is proposed that utilizes the Open Network Operating System (ONOS) cluster. According to the findings of our suggested architecture, it outperforms a single SDN controller framework by a factor of more than ten times the throughput. This provides for a higher flow of data throughout the network while decreasing congestion caused by a single controller's processing restrictions. Furthermore, our CECD-AS approach outperforms state-of-the-art physics and machine learning-based techniques in terms of attack classification. The performance of the framework is investigated under various types of communication attacks.

AB In human neuroscience, machine learning can help reveal lower-dimensional neural representations relevant to subjects' behavior. However, state-of-the-art models typically require large datasets to train, and so are prone to overfitting on human neuroimaging data that often possess few samples but many input dimensions. Here, we capitalized on the fact that the features we seek in human neuroscience are precisely those relevant to subjects' behavior rather than noise or other irrelevant factors. We thus developed a Task-Relevant Autoencoder via Classifier Enhancement (TRACE) designed to identify behaviorally-relevant target neural patterns. We benchmarked TRACE against a standard autoencoder and other models for two severely truncated machine learning datasets (to match the data typically available in functional magnetic resonance imaging [fMRI] data for an individual subject), then evaluated all models on fMRI data from 59 subjects who observed animals and objects. TRACE outperformed alternative models nearly unilaterally, showing up to 12% increased classification accuracy and up to 56% improvement in discovering "cleaner", task-relevant representations. These results showcase TRACE's potential for a wide variety of data related to human behavior.

AB In the present study, Raman spectroscopy is employed to assess the potential toxicity of chemical substances. Having several advantages compared to other traditional methods, Raman spectroscopy is an ideal solution for investigating cells in their natural environment. In the present work, we combine the power of spectral resolution of Raman with one of the most widely used machine learning techniques. Support vector machines (SVMs) are used in the context of classification on a well established database. The database is constructed on three different classes: healthy cells, Triton X-100 (necrotic death), and etoposide (apoptotic death). SVM classifiers successfully assess the potential effect of the test toxins (Triton X-100, etoposide). The cells that are exposed to heat (45 A degrees C) are tested using the classification rules obtained. It is shown that the heat effect results in apoptotic death, which is in agreement with existing literature.

AB Region visual features enhance the generative capability of the machines based on features. However, they lack proper interaction-based attentional perceptions and end up with biased or uncorrelated sentences or pieces of misinformation. In this work, we propose Attribute Interaction-Tensor Product Representation (aiTPR), which is a convenient way of gathering more information through orthogonal combination and learning the interactions as physical entities (tensors) and improving the captions. Compared to previous works, where features add up to undefined feature spaces, TPR helps maintain sanity in combinations, and orthogonality helps define familiar spaces. We have introduced a new concept layer that defines the objects and their interactions that can play a crucial role in determining different descriptions. The interaction portions have contributed heavily to better caption quality and have out-performed various previous works on this domain and MSCOCO dataset. For the first time, we introduced the notion of combining regional image features and abstracted interaction likelihood embedding for image captioning.

DE Machine learning; Severe weather; Emergency system incidents;
   Predictions; Catalonia
AB In this work, Machine Learning (ML) techniques are used to develop tools capable of accurately predicting the impact of severe weather events. We use readily accessible predictors, including daily meteorological data, basic demographics, geographic and terrain features, along with the number of daily meteorological incidents reported to the emergency services. The model was built using disaggregated data from the 947 municipalities from the region of Catalonia between January 1, 2015 and June 30, 2021. Catalonia's region is situated in the northeastern part of Spain along the Mediterranean Basin, and frequently experiences storms with strong winds and intense rainfall. In 2020, such weather events resulted in 64 injuries and damages amounting to approximately 70 million USD. The ML-based model presented in this study shows a predictive capacity for extreme weather risk superior to that of the daily meteorological warning system of the Meteorological Service of Catalonia. In addition, the model has been used to estimate how urbanization modifies the extreme weather impact. Given the expected increase in the intensity, frequency, and duration of extreme weather events in the context of global warming, the methodology presented in this work could be helpful in developing tools to assist emergency service managers and policy makers in making rapid and effective decisions.

AB Machine learning methods, combined with large electronic health databases, could enable a personalised approach to medicine through improved diagnosis and prediction of individual responses to therapies. If successful, this strategy would represent a revolution in clinical research and practice. However, although the vision of individually tailored medicine is alluring, there is a need to distinguish genuine potential from hype. We argue that the goal of personalised medical care faces serious challenges, many of which cannot be addressed through algorithmic complexity, and call for collaboration between traditional methodologists and experts in medical machine learning to avoid extensive research waste.

ID CONTINUOUS-TIME; SYSTEMS; TRACKING; DESIGN
AB An infinite-horizon optimal regulation problem for a control-affine deterministic system is solved online using a local state following (StaF) kernel and a regional model-based reinforcement learning (R-MBRL) method to approximate the value function. Unlike traditional methods such as R-MBRL that aim to approximate the value function over a large compact set, the StaF kernel approach aims to approximate the value function in a local neighborhood of the state that travels within a compact set. In this paper, the value function is approximated using a state-dependent convex combination of the StaF-based and the R-MBRL-based approximations. As the state enters a neighborhood containing the origin, the value function transitions from being approximated by the StaF approach to the R-MBRL approach. Semiglobal uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB) convergence of the system states to the origin is established using a Lyapunov-based analysis. Simulation results are provided for two, three, six, and ten-state dynamical systems to demonstrate the scalability and performance of the developed method.

AB Background: In a previous study, we developed a highly performant and clinically-translatable machine learning algorithm for a prediction of three-year conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Pre-mild Cognitive Impairment. Further tests are necessary to demonstrate its accuracy when applied to subjects not used in the original training process. In this study, we aimed to provide preliminary evidence of this via a transfer learning approach. Methods: We initially employed the same baseline information (i.e. clinical and neuropsychological test scores, cardiovascular risk indexes, and a visual rating scale for brain atrophy) and the same machine learning technique (support vector machine with radial-basis function kernel) used in our previous study to retrain the algorithm to discriminate between participants with AD (n = 75) and normal cognition (n = 197). Then, the algorithm was applied to perform the original task of predicting the three-year conversion to AD in the sample of 61 MCI subjects that we used in the previous study. Results: Even after the retraining, the algorithm demonstrated a significant predictive performance in the MCI sample (AUC = 0.821, 95% CI bootstrap = 0.705-0.912, best balanced accuracy = 0.779, sensitivity = 0.852, specificity = 0.706). Conclusions: These results provide a first indirect evidence that our original algorithm can also perform relevant generalized predictions when applied to new MCI individuals. This motivates future efforts to bring the algorithm to sufficient levels of optimization and trustworthiness that will allow its application in both clinical and research settings.

AB Classification of High Dimension Low Sample Size (HDLSS) datasets is a challenging task in supervised learning. Such datasets are prevalent in various areas including biomedical applications and business analytics. In this paper, a new embedded feature selection method for HDLSS datasets is introduced by incorporating sparsity in Proximal Support Vector Machines (PSVMs). Our method, called Sparse Proximal Support Vector Machines (sPSVMs), learns a sparse representation of PSVMs by first casting it as an equivalent least squares problem and then introducing the l(1)-norm for sparsity. An efficient algorithm based on alternating optimization techniques is proposed. sPSVMs remove more than 98% of features in many high dimensional datasets without compromising on generalization performance. Stability in the feature selection process of sPSVMs is also studied and compared with other univariate filter techniques. Additionally, sPSVMs offer the advantage of interpreting the selected features in the context of the classes by inducing class-specific local sparsity instead of global sparsity like other embedded methods. sPSVMs appear to be robust with respect to data dimensionality. Moreover, sPSVMs are able to perform feature selection and classification in one step, eliminating the need for dimensionality reduction on the data. To that end, sPSVMs can be used for preprocessing free classification tasks. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Peer review of GPT-4 technical report and systems card
SO PLOS DIGITAL HEALTH
LA English
DT Review
AB The study provides a comprehensive review of OpenAI's Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 (GPT-4) technical report, with an emphasis on applications in high-risk settings like healthcare. A diverse team, including experts in artificial intelligence (AI), natural language processing, public health, law, policy, social science, healthcare research, and bioethics, analyzed the report against established peer review guidelines. The GPT-4 report shows a significant commitment to transparent AI research, particularly in creating a systems card for risk assessment and mitigation. However, it reveals limitations such as restricted access to training data, inadequate confidence and uncertainty estimations, and concerns over privacy and intellectual property rights. Key strengths identified include the considerable time and economic investment in transparent AI research and the creation of a comprehensive systems card. On the other hand, the lack of clarity in training processes and data raises concerns about encoded biases and interests in GPT-4. The report also lacks confidence and uncertainty estimations, crucial in high-risk areas like healthcare, and fails to address potential privacy and intellectual property issues. Furthermore, this study emphasizes the need for diverse, global involvement in developing and evaluating large language models (LLMs) to ensure broad societal benefits and mitigate risks. The paper presents recommendations such as improving data transparency, developing accountability frameworks, establishing confidence standards for LLM outputs in high-risk settings, and enhancing industry research review processes. It concludes that while GPT-4's report is a step towards open discussions on LLMs, more extensive interdisciplinary reviews are essential for addressing bias, harm, and risk concerns, especially in high-risk domains. The review aims to expand the understanding of LLMs in general and highlights the need for new reflection forms on how LLMs are reviewed, the data required for effective evaluation, and addressing critical issues like bias and risk.

AB Monitoring physical demands during task execution with exoskeletons can be instrumental in understanding their suitability for industrial tasks. This study aimed at developing a fatigue level prediction model for Back-Support Industrial Exoskeletons (BSIEs) using wearable sensors. Fourteen participants performed a set of intermittent trunk-flexion task cycles consisting of static, sustained, and dynamic activities, until they reached medium-high fatigue levels, while wearing BSIEs. Three classification algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost (XGB), were implemented to predict perceived fatigue level in the back and leg regions using features from four wearable wireless Electromyography (EMG) sensors with integrated Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). We examined the best grouping and sensor combinations by comparing prediction performance. The findings showed best performance in binary classification of leg and back fatigue with 95% (2 EMG + IMU sensors) and 82% (single IMU sensor) accuracy, respectively. Tertiary classification for back and leg fatigue level prediction required four sensor setups with both EMG and IMU measures to perform at 79% and 67% accuracy, respectively. The efforts presented in our article demonstrate the feasibility of an accessible fatigue level detection system, which can be beneficial for objective fatigue assessment, design selection, and implementation of BSIEs in real-world scenarios.

TI DO AIS DREAM OF ELECTRIC BOARDS?
SO NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW
LA English
DT Article
ID CORPORATE; LIABILITY; LAW
AB When artificial intelligence (AI) acquires self-awareness, agency, and unique intelligence, it will attain ontological personhood. Management of firms by AI would be technologically and economically feasible. The law could confer upon AI the status of legal personhood, as it did upon traditional business firms in the past, thus dispensing with the need for inserting AI as property within the legal boundary of a firm. As a separate and distinct entity, AI could function independently as a manager in the way that legal or natural persons do today: i.e., AI as director, officer, partner, member, or manager. Such a future is desirable only if AI as manager creates more value than AI as tool or android serf. The principle of legal personhood is not intrinsically incompatible with the idea of machine person. This Article explores the legal, policy, and economic questions: Could we confer legal personhood on AI? Should we? This Article answers that the idea of AI as manager, qua legal person, is compelling. Economic and legal theories suggest that the conferral of AI personhood, permitting AI as manager, would create more value. With respect to law and policy, current laws of business firms suffice to provide the essential framework for the future. They mandate that corporate managers must be natural persons, but permit managers of noncorporate firms to be legal persons. This dichotomy provides the appropriate conceptual compromise. The use of AI as manager should be limited to private and noncorporate firms. This compromise, coupled with the limiting conditions identified in this Article, reflects the balances of cost and benefit as well as risk and value. Corporations have always been more consequential enterprises, and permitting AIto serve as corporate officers or directors could impose greater social and economic externalities. Legal personhood of AI would usher in a brave new world, which should be welcomed in the spirit of innovation-but the law should ensure a stable old world.

ID RECOGNITION
AB Computer vision (CV), a non-intrusive and cost-effective technology, has furthered the development of precision livestock farming by enabling optimized decision-making through timely and individualized animal care. The availability of affordable two- and three-dimensional camera sensors, combined with various machine learning and deep learning algorithms, has provided a valuable opportunity to improve livestock production systems. However, despite the availability of various CV tools in the public domain, applying these tools to animal data can be challenging, often requiring users to have programming and data analysis skills, as well as access to computing resources. Moreover, the rapid expansion of precision livestock farming is creating a growing need to educate and train animal science students in CV. This presents educators with the challenge of efficiently demonstrating the complex algorithms involved in CV. Thus, the objective of this study was to develop ShinyAnimalCV, an open-source cloud-based web application designed to facilitate CV teaching in animal science. This application provides a user-friendly interface for performing CV tasks, including object segmentation, detection, three-dimensional surface visualization, and extraction of two- and three-dimensional morphological features. Nine pre-trained CV models using top-view animal data are included in the application. ShinyAnimalCV has been deployed online using cloud computing platforms. The source code of ShinyAnimalCV is available on GitHub, along with detailed documentation on training CV models using custom data and deploying ShinyAnimalCV locally to allow users to fully leverage the capabilities of the application. ShinyAnimalCV can help to support the teaching of CV, thereby laying the groundwork to promote the adoption of CV in the animal science community.
   The integration of cameras and data science has great potential to revolutionize livestock production systems, making them more efficient and sustainable by replacing human-based management with real-time individualized animal care. However, applying these digital tools to animal data presents challenges that require computer programming and data analysis skills, as well as access to computing resources. Additionally, there is a growing need to train animal science students to analyze image or video data using data science algorithms. However, teaching computer programming to all types of students from the ground up can prove complicated and challenging. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop ShinyAnimalCV, a user-friendly online web application that supports users to learn the application of data science to analyze animal digital video data, without the need for complex coding. The application includes nine pre-trained models for detecting and segmenting animals in image data and can be easily accessed through a web browser. We have also made the source code and detailed documentation available online for advanced users who wish to use the application locally. This software tool facilitates the teaching of digital animal data analysis in the animal science community, with potential benefits to livestock production systems.

AB Once a week, intact and castrated male Wistar rats were intramuscularly injected with a 0.2 ml suspension of either 0, 10, or 50 mg nandrolone decanoate in cottonseed oil, for 8 consecutive weeks. After the sixth injection, locomotor activity was measured in an open-field and the acquisition of lever press behavior was assessed in an autoshaping procedure. Subsequently, all subjects were exposed to four sessions of continuous reinforcement prior to one session in which the effects of steroid administration on extinction were assessed. Locomotor activity decreased for all groups of rats with continued exposure to the open-field, differences between groups were not observed. Rats treated with the highest dose of nandrolone decanoate spent more time in the margin of the open-field. There were no significant differences between groups on any of the learning measures. Long-term, high-dose steroid administration in conjunction with mild food deprivation inhibited growth in intact and castrated rats, while low dose administration affected body weight in intact rats only. Steroid administration resulted in heavier and enlarged kidneys and lighter testes as well. These results suggest that the administration of anabolic steroids not only produces observable physiological changes, but that it may also affect spontaneous behavior. The failure to find differences in learning indices may have been a function of the particular paradigms used in the present experiment.

AB Purpose Ionization chambers are the detectors of choice for photon beam profile scanning. However, they introduce significant volume averaging effect (VAE) that can artificially broaden the penumbra width by 2-3 mm. The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of photon beam profile deconvolution (the elimination of VAE from ionization chamber-measured beam profiles) using a three-layer feedforward neural network. Methods Transverse beam profiles of photon fields between 2 x 2 and 10 x 10 cm(2) were collected with both a CC13 ionization chamber and an EDGE diode detector on an Elekta Versa HD accelerator. These profiles were divided into three datasets (training, validation and test) to train and test a three-layer feedforward neural network. A sliding window was used to extract input data from the CC13-measured profiles. The neural network produced the deconvolved value at the center of the sliding window. The full deconvolved profile was obtained after the sliding window was moved over the measured profile from end to end. The EDGE-measured beam profiles were used as reference for the training, validation, and test. The number of input neurons, which equals the sliding window width, and the number of hidden neurons were optimized with a parametric sweeping method. A total of 135 neural networks were fully trained with the Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation algorithm. The one with the best overall performance on the training and validation dataset was selected to test its generalization ability on the test dataset. The agreement between the neural network-deconvolved profiles and the EDGE-measured profiles was evaluated with two metrics: mean squared error (MSE) and penumbra width difference (PWD). Results Based on the two-dimensional MSE plots, the optimal combination of sliding window width of 15 and 5 hidden neurons was selected for the final neural network. Excellent agreement was achieved between the neural network-deconvolved profiles and the reference profiles in all three datasets. After deconvolution, the mean PWD reduced from 2.43 +/- 0.26, 2.44 +/- 0.36, and 2.46 +/- 0.29 mm to 0.15 +/- 0.15, 0.04 +/- 0.03, and 0.14 +/- 0.09 mm for the training, validation, and test dataset, respectively. Conclusions We demonstrated the feasibility of photon beam profile deconvolution with a feedforward neural network in this work. The beam profiles deconvolved with a three-layer neural network had excellent agreement with diode-measured profiles.

AB This study aims to provide a systematic review of recent eye-tracking studies conducted with children and adolescents in learning settings, as well as a scoping review of the technologies and machine learning approaches used for eye-tracking. To this end, 68 empirical studies containing 78 experiments were analyzed. Eye-tracking devices as well as the ever-evolving mechanisms of gaze prediction endorsed in the prior and current research were identified. The review results indicated a set of salient patterns governing the employment of eye-tracking measures and the inferred cognitive constructs in learning, along with the common practices in analyzing and presenting the eye-tracking data. Eye-tracking has been used to track engagement, learning interactions, and learning-relevant cognitive activities mainly in a research lab or a highly-controlled learning setting. The mechanisms of gaze capturing and prediction with learners in a dynamic and authentic learning environment are evolving.

ID TEMPERATURE; MODEL
AB This paper focuses on the methodology for evaluating the degree of total curling in concrete pavement using machine learning. Deflection induced by falling weight deflectometer (FWD) testing is known as a direct correlation to total curling including built-in and daily curling. However, deflection measurement in the in-service road is also affected by others, such as environmental conditions, pavement geometry, subgrade stiffness, and mixture design. Thus, it is challenging to determine the level of curling from FWD data due to the complexity of influencing parameters. To navigate this complexity, prominent machine learning models are exploited to identify a non-linear relationship between curling and FWD deflections. A finite-element simulation of FWD is conducted to generate a vast data set, and a robust regression model is trained to estimate the total effective temperature difference (TETD) to quantify the effects of curling. Since input parameters for testing pavements can be measurable in the field, curling from TETD can be readily obtained using the proposed methodology. Comparative simulations highlight that the proposed models, with an MAE less than 0.5 degrees C significantly outperform the multiple regression performance, which registers an MAE of 3.45 degrees C in TETD, particularly in offering cost-effective and noise-tolerant prediction.

AB Generative AI including large language models (LLMs) has recently gained significant interest in the geoscience community through its versatile task-solving capabilities including programming, arithmetic reasoning, generation of sample data, time-series forecasting, toponym recognition, or image classification. Existing performance assessments of LLMs for spatial tasks have primarily focused on ChatGPT, whereas other chatbots received less attention. To narrow this research gap, this study conducts a zero-shot correctness evaluation for a set of 76 spatial tasks across seven task categories assigned to four prominent chatbots, that is, ChatGPT-4, Gemini, Claude-3, and Copilot. The chatbots generally performed well on tasks related to spatial literacy, GIS theory, and interpretation of programming code and functions, but revealed weaknesses in mapping, code writing, and spatial reasoning. Furthermore, there was a significant difference in the correctness of results between the four chatbots. Responses from repeated tasks assigned to each chatbot showed a high level of consistency in responses with matching rates of over 80% for most task categories in the four chatbots.

AB This study addresses the urgent need for effective methods to monitor and conserve Araucaria angustifolia, a critically endangered species of immense ecological and cultural significance in southern Brazil. Using high-resolution satellite images from Google Earth, we apply the YOLOv7x deep learning model to detect this species in two distinct urban contexts in Curitiba, Paran & aacute;: isolated trees across the urban landscape and A. angustifolia individuals within forest remnants. Data augmentation techniques, including image rotation, hue and saturation adjustments, and mosaic augmentation, were employed to increase the model's accuracy and robustness. Through a 5-fold cross-validation, the model achieved a mean Average Precision (AP) of 90.79% and an F1-score of 88.68%. Results show higher detection accuracy in forest remnants, where the homogeneous background of natural landscapes facilitated the identification of trees, compared to urban areas where complex visual elements like building shadows presented challenges. To reduce false positives, especially misclassifications involving palm species, additional annotations were introduced, significantly enhancing performance in urban environments. These findings highlight the potential of integrating remote sensing with deep learning to automate large-scale forest inventories. Furthermore, the study highlights the broader applicability of the YOLOv7x model for urban forestry planning, offering a cost-effective solution for biodiversity monitoring. The integration of predictive data with urban forest maps reveals a spatial correlation between A. angustifolia density and the presence of forest fragments, suggesting that the preservation of these areas is vital for the species' sustainability. The model's scalability also opens the door for future applications in ecological monitoring across larger urban areas. As urban environments continue to expand, understanding and conserving key species like A. angustifolia is critical for enhancing biodiversity, resilience, and addressing climate change.

AB Large volumes of video data recorded by the increasing mobile devices and embedded sensors can be leveraged to answer queries of our lives, physical world and our evolving society. Especially, the rapid development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the past few years offers the great advantage for multiple tasks in video analysis. However, adopting running CNNs directly on mobile devices and embedded sensors for video analytics brings heavy burden due to their limited capacity, especially for learning a large volume of data. A promising approach is to outsource the computation-intensive part of CNN to cloud. However, the reveal of data to cloud may cause privacy leakage. In addition, the cloud-assisted approach may also bring some communication efficiency challenges for large volume of data. To address both privacy and efficiency issues, we design a privacy-preserving and computationally efficient framework for mobile video analytics. To protect the private information, we split the CNN model into two subnetworks, and first part is used as a feature extractor deployed in the mobile side and the second part is utilized as a classifier deployed in the cloud side. A specific-designed adversarial training process is adopted in order to extract features for normal task classification while hiding the features for sensitive task. In addition, to improve video process efficiency, we design a two-stage framework. The first stage is to extract key frames and necessary intermediate frames, while skipping redundant ones. The second stage is to extract the features of key frames by CNN-based feature extractor but apply optical-flow-based feature propagation algorithm to obtain the features of intermediate frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate our proposed system PrivacyEye can effectively protect private information while keep the accuracy of the normal tasks with less than 2 percent drop, and it saves up to 82.9 percent execution time and 78.8 percent energy consumption.

AB Interest in applying Big Data to tourism is increasing, and automated sentiment analysis has been used to extract public opinion from various sources. This article evaluates the suitability of different types of automated classifiers for applications typical in tourism, hospitality, and marketing studies by comparing their performance to that of human raters. While the commonly used performance indices suggest that on easier-to-classify data sets machine learning methods demonstrate performance comparable to that by human raters, other performance measures such as Cohen's kappa show that the results of machine learning are still inferior to manual processing. On more difficult and noisy data sets, automated analysis has poorer performance than human raters. The article discusses issues pertinent to selection of appropriate sentiment analysis software and offers a word of caution against using automated classifiers uncritically.

AB Flavor and quality are the major drivers of fruit consumption in the US. However, the poor flavor of modern commercial tomato varieties is a major cause of consumer dissatisfaction. Studies in flavor research have informed the role of volatile organic compounds in improving overall liking and sweetness of tomatoes. These studies have utilized and applied the tools of molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry, omics, machine learning, and gene editing to elucidate the compounds and biochemical pathways essential for good tasting fruit. Here, we discuss the progress in identifying the biosynthetic pathways and chemical modifications of important tomato volatile compounds. We also summarize the advances in developing highly flavorful tomato varieties and future steps toward developing a "perfect tomato".

AB ObjectivesComplex diseases, like diabetic kidney disease (DKD), often exhibit heterogeneity, challenging accurate risk prediction with machine learning. Traditional global models ignore patient differences, and subgroup learning lacks interpretability and predictive efficiency. This study introduces the Interpretable Subgroup Learning-based Modeling (iSLIM) framework to address these issues.MethodsiSLIM integrates expert knowledge with a tree-based recursive partitioning approach to identify DKD subgroups within an EHR dataset of 11,559 patients. It then constructs separate models for each subgroup, enhancing predictive accuracy while preserving interpretability.ResultsFive clinically relevant subgroups are identified, achieving an average sensitivity of 0.8074, outperforming a single global model by 0.1104. Post hoc analyses provide pathological and biological evidence supporting subgroup validity and potential DKD risk factors.ConclusionThe iSLIM surpasses traditional global model in predictive performance and subgroup-specific risk factor interpretation, enhancing the understanding of DKD's heterogeneous mechanisms and potentially increasing the adoption of machine learning models in clinical decision-making.

AB Simple Summary Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is commonly treated using high-dose radiotherapy. Careful radiotherapy planning is crucial for the eradication of cancer cells while avoiding injuries to normal structures. This balance is often delicate given the complex anatomic location in which NPC is situated. This article highlights the considerations, practical pearls, and recent advances in the precise delivery of radiotherapy in NPC patients. Radiotherapy is the primary treatment modality for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Successful curative treatment requires optimal radiotherapy planning and precise beam delivery that maximizes locoregional control while minimizing treatment-related side effects. In this article, we highlight considerations in target delineation, radiation dose, and the adoption of technological advances with the aim of optimizing the benefits of radiotherapy in NPC patients.

AB A study has been made of the ability of neural networks to estimate the aqueous solubility of a wide range of organic compounds. A training set of 331 compounds was used and the trained neural network tested on a prediction set of 19 unknown compounds. A comparison was made with the results obtained from a previous study using regression analysis (Bodor et al. 2). On the basis of training set results, the neural network model exceeded the performance of the regression analysis technique and gave a prediction which was sufficiently accurate to estimate the water solubility of an organic compound based entirely on calculated values of selected properties.

AB Parkinson's disease (PD) is a serious neurodegenerative disorder marked by significant clinical and progression heterogeneity. This study aimed at addressing heterogeneity of PD through integrative analysis of various data modalities. We analyzed clinical progression data (>= 5 years) of individuals with de novo PD using machine learning and deep learning, to characterize individuals' phenotypic progression trajectories for PD subtyping. We discovered three pace subtypes of PD exhibiting distinct progression patterns: the Inching Pace subtype (PD-I) with mild baseline severity and mild progression speed; the Moderate Pace subtype (PD-M) with mild baseline severity but advancing at a moderate progression rate; and the Rapid Pace subtype (PD-R) with the most rapid symptom progression rate. We found cerebrospinal fluid P-tau/alpha-synuclein ratio and atrophy in certain brain regions as potential markers of these subtypes. Analyses of genetic and transcriptomic profiles with network-based approaches identified molecular modules associated with each subtype. For instance, the PD-R-specific module suggested STAT3, FYN, BECN1, APOA1, NEDD4, and GATA2 as potential driver genes of PD-R. It also suggested neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, metabolism, PI3K/AKT, and angiogenesis pathways as potential drivers for rapid PD progression (i.e., PD-R). Moreover, we identified repurposable drug candidates by targeting these subtype-specific molecular modules using network-based approach and cell line drug-gene signature data. We further estimated their treatment effects using two large-scale real-world patient databases; the real-world evidence we gained highlighted the potential of metformin in ameliorating PD progression. In conclusion, this work helps better understand clinical and pathophysiological complexity of PD progression and accelerate precision medicine.

   Gradient Descent
SO IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING MAGAZINE

DT Article
ID CONVERGENCE; CONSENSUS; BEHAVIOR
AB We provide a discussion of several recent results which, in certain scenarios, are able to overcome a barrier in distributed stochastic optimization for machine learning (ML). Our focus is the so-called asymptotic network independence property, which is achieved whenever a distributed method executed over a network of n nodes asymptotically converges to the optimal solution at a comparable rate to a centralized method with the same computational power as the entire network. We explain this property through an example involving the training of ML models and sketch a short mathematical analysis for comparing the performance of distributed stochastic gradient descent (DSGD) with centralized SGD.

AB Objective Our objective is to develop and validate TrajVis, an interactive tool that assists clinicians in using artificial intelligence (AI) models to leverage patients' longitudinal electronic medical records (EMRs) for personalized precision management of chronic disease progression.Materials and Methods We first perform requirement analysis with clinicians and data scientists to determine the visual analytics tasks of the TrajVis system as well as its design and functionalities. A graph AI model for chronic kidney disease (CKD) trajectory inference named DisEase PrOgression Trajectory (DEPOT) is used for system development and demonstration. TrajVis is implemented as a full-stack web application with synthetic EMR data derived from the Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist Translational Data Warehouse and the Indiana Network for Patient Care research database. A case study with a nephrologist and a user experience survey of clinicians and data scientists are conducted to evaluate the TrajVis system.Results The TrajVis clinical information system is composed of 4 panels: the Patient View for demographic and clinical information, the Trajectory View to visualize the DEPOT-derived CKD trajectories in latent space, the Clinical Indicator View to elucidate longitudinal patterns of clinical features and interpret DEPOT predictions, and the Analysis View to demonstrate personal CKD progression trajectories. System evaluations suggest that TrajVis supports clinicians in summarizing clinical data, identifying individualized risk predictors, and visualizing patient disease progression trajectories, overcoming the barriers of AI implementation in healthcare.Discussion The TrajVis system provides a novel visualization solution which is complimentary to other risk estimators such as the Kidney Failure Risk Equations.Conclusion TrajVis bridges the gap between the fast-growing AI/ML modeling and the clinical use of such models for personalized and precision management of chronic diseases.

AB Psychiatric neurosurgery teams in the United States and Europe have studied deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral anterior limb of the internal capsule and adjacent ventral striatum (VC/VS) for severe and highly treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder. Four groups have collaborated most closely, in small-scale studies, over the past 8 years. First to begin was Leuven/Antwerp, followed by Butler Hospital/Brown Medical School, the Cleveland Clinic and most recently the University of Florida. These centers used comparable patient selection criteria and surgical targeting. Targeting, but not selection, evolved during this period. Here, we present combined long-term results of those studies, which reveal clinically significant symptom reductions and functional improvement in about two-thirds of patients. DBS was well tolerated overall and adverse effects were overwhelmingly transient. Results generally improved for patients implanted more recently, suggesting a 'learning curve' both within and across centers. This is well known from the development of DBS for movement disorders. The main factor accounting for these gains appears to be the refinement of the implantation site. Initially, an anterior-posterior location based on anterior capsulotomy lesions was used. In an attempt to improve results, more posterior sites were investigated resulting in the current target, at the junction of the anterior capsule, anterior commissure and posterior ventral striatum. Clinical results suggest that neural networks relevant to therapeutic improvement might be modulated more effectively at a more posterior target. Taken together, these data show that the procedure can be successfully implemented by dedicated interdisciplinary teams, and support its therapeutic promise.

AB Cross-validation (CV) is a resampling approach to evaluate machine learning models when sample size is limited. The number of all possible combinations of folds for the training data, known as CV rounds, are often very small in leave-one-out CV. Alternatively, Monte Carlo cross-validation (MCCV) can be performed with a flexible number of simulations when computational resources are feasible for a study with limited sample size. We conduct extensive simulation studies to compare accuracy between MCCV and CV with the same number of simulations for a study with binary outcome (e.g., disease progression or not). Accuracy of MCCV is generally higher than CV although the gain is small. They have similar performance when sample size is large. Meanwhile, MCCV is going to provide reliable performance metrics as the number of simulations increases. Two real examples are used to illustrate the comparison between MCCV and CV.

AB The Eliashberg theory of superconductivity accounts for the fundamental physics of conventional superconductors, including the retardation of the interaction and the Coulomb pseudopotential, to predict the critical temperature T-c. McMillan, Allen, and Dynes derived approximate closed-form expressions for the critical temperature within this theory, which depends on the electron-phonon spectral function alpha F-2(omega). Here we show that modern machine-learning techniques can substantially improve these formulae, accounting for more general shapes of the alpha F-2 function. Using symbolic regression and the SISSO framework, together with a database of artificially generated alpha F-2 functions and numerical solutions of the Eliashberg equations, we derive a formula for T-c that performs as well as Allen-Dynes for low-T-c superconductors and substantially better for higher-T-c ones. This corrects the systematic underestimation of T-c while reproducing the physical constraints originally outlined by Allen and Dynes. This equation should replace the Allen-Dynes formula for the prediction of higher-temperature superconductors.

AB Identification of input configurations so as to meet a prespecified output target under a limited experimental budget has been an important task for computer experiments. Such a task often involves the development of response models and design of experimental trials that rely on the models exhibiting continuity and differentiability properties. Motivated by two canonical examples in systems and manufacturing engineering, we propose a strategy for locating the boundary of the response surface in computer experiments, wherein on one side the response is finite, whereas on the other side it is infinite, leveraging ideas from active learning and quasi-Monte Carlo methods. The strategy is illustrated on an example from computer networks engineering and one from precision manufacturing and shown to allocate experimental trials in a fairly effective manner. We conclude by discussing extensions of the proposed strategy to characterize other types of output discontinuity or nondifferentiability in high-cost experiments, including jump discontinuities in the target output response or pathological structures such as kinks and cusps.

AB We introduce a real-time measure of conditional biases to firms' earnings forecasts. The measure is defined as the difference between analysts' expectations and a statistically optimal unbiased machine-learning benchmark. Analysts' conditional expectations are, on average, biased upward, a bias that increases in the forecast horizon. These biases are associated with negative cross-sectional return predictability, and the short legs of many anomalies contain firms with excessively optimistic earnings forecasts. Further, managers of companies with the greatest upward-biased earnings forecasts are more likely to issue stocks. Commonly used linear earnings models do not work out-of-sample and are inferior to those analysts provide.

AB Background Reference histomorphometric data of healthy human kidneys are largely lacking because of laborious quantitation requirements. Correlating histomorphometric featureswith clinical parameters throughmachine learning approaches can provide valuable information about natural population variance. To this end, we leveraged deep learning (DL), computational image analysis, and feature analysis to associate the relationship of histomorphometry with patient age, sex, serum creatinine (SCr), and eGFR in a multinational set of reference kidney tissue sections.
   Methods A panoptic segmentation neural network was developed and used to segment viable and sclerotic glomeruli, cortical and medullary interstitia, tubules, and arteries/arterioles in the digitized images of 79 periodic acid-Schiff-stained human nephrectomy sections showing minimal pathologic changes. Simple morphometrics (e.g., area, radius, density) were quantified from the segmented classes. Regression analysis aided in determining the association of histomorphometric parameters with age, sex, SCr, and eGFR.
   Results Our DL model achieved high segmentation performance for all test compartments. The size and density of glomeruli, tubules, and arteries/arterioles varied significantly among healthy humans, with potentially large differences between geographically diverse patients. Glomerular size was significantly correlated with SCr and eGFR. Slight, albeit significant, differences in renal vasculature were observed between sexes. Glomerulosclerosis percentage increased, and cortical density of arteries/arterioles decreased, as a function of increasing age.
   Conclusions Using DL, we automated precise measurements of kidney histomorphometric features. In the reference kidney tissue, several histomorphometric features demonstrated significant correlation to patient demographics, SCr, and eGFR. DL tools can increase the efficiency and rigor of histomorphometric analysis.

AB This study investigates several factors influencing the well-known price/earnings ratio (P/E), with particular emphasis on investor sentiment scores obtained from textual data using natural language processing models. Data consisting of various economic indicators and user-generated text messages from the social network Twitter were collected for several established firms that were categorized into two sectors. Sentiment scores from the textual data were obtained using the BERT and FinBERT language models and shown to exhibit a high level of accuracy. Fixed and random effect regression models considering panel data comprising the economics indicators and sentiment scores were constructed and revealed statistically significant influences of sentiment on the P/E ratio in one sector. A Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural network model was then used to forecast the P/E ratio over a one year interval, which produced highly accurate results. Our analysis demonstrates the significance of investor sentiment as a factor in P/E ratio forecasting, emphasizing its contribution alongside other fundamental factors.

AB Robotic teleoperation, i.e., manipulating remote robotic systems at a distance, has gained its popularity in various industrial applications, including construction operations. The key to a successful teleoperation robot system is the delicate design of the human-robot interface that helps strengthen the human operator's situational awareness. Traditional human-robot interface for robotic teleoperation is usually based on imagery data (e.g., video streaming), causing the limited field of view (FOV) and increased cognitive burden for processing additional spatial information. As a result, 3D scene reconstruction methods based on point cloud models captured by scanning technologies (e.g., depth camera and LiDAR) have been explored to provide immersive and intuitive feedback to the human operator. Despite the added benefits of applying reconstructed 3D scenes in telerobotic systems, challenges still present. Most 3D reconstruction methods utilize raw point cloud data due to the difficulty of real-time model rendering. The significant size of point cloud data makes the processing and transfer between robots and human operators difficult and slow. In addition, most reconstructed point cloud models do not contain physical properties such as weight and colliders. A more enriched control mechanism based on physics engine simulations is impossible. This paper presents an intelligent robot teleoperation interface that collects, processes, transfers, and reconstructs the immersive scene model of the workspace in Virtual Reality (VR) and enables intuitive robot controls accordingly. The proposed system, Telerobotic Operation based on Auto-reconstructed Remote Scene (TOARS), utilizes a deep learning algorithm to automatically detect objects in the captured scene, along with their physical properties, based on the point cloud data. The processed information is then transferred to the game engine where rendered virtual objects replace the original point cloud models in the VR environment. TOARS is expected to significantly improve the efficiency of 3D scene reconstruction and situational awareness of human operators in robotic teleoperation.

TI An ultra-fast deep-learning-based dose engine for prostate VMAT via
   knowledge distillation framework with limited patient data
SO PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY

ID OPTIMIZATION; CONVOLUTION; IMPACT
AB Objective. Deep-learning (DL)-based dose engines have been developed to alleviate the intrinsic compromise between the calculation accuracy and efficiency of the traditional dose calculation algorithms. However, current DL-based engines typically possess high computational complexity and require powerful computing devices. Therefore, to mitigate their computational burdens and broaden their applicability to a clinical setting where resource-limited devices are available, we proposed a compact dose engine via knowledge distillation (KD) framework that offers an ultra-fast calculation speed with high accuracy for prostate Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT). Approach. The KD framework contains two sub-models: a large pre-trained teacher and a small to-be-trained student. The student receives knowledge transferred from the teacher for better generalization. The trained student serves as the final engine for dose calculation. The model input is patient computed tomography and VMAT dose in water, and the output is DL-calculated patient dose. The ground-truth \dose was computed by the Monte Carlo module of the Monaco treatment planning system. Twenty and ten prostate cases were included for model training and assessment, respectively. The model's performance (teacher/student/student-only) was evaluated by Gamma analysis and inference efficiency. Main results. The dosimetric comparisons (input/DL-calculated/ground-truth doses) suggest that the proposed engine can effectively convert low-accuracy doses in water to high-accuracy patient doses. The Gamma passing rate (2%/2 mm, 10% threshold) between the DL-calculated and ground-truth doses was 98.64 +/- 0.62% (teacher), 98.13 +/- 0.76% (student), and 96.95 +/- 1.02% (student-only). The inference time was 16 milliseconds (teacher) and 11 milliseconds (student/student-only) using a graphics processing unit device, while it was 936 milliseconds (teacher) and 374 milliseconds (student/student-only) using a central processing unit device. Significance. With the KD framework, a compact dose engine can achieve comparable accuracy to that of a larger one. Its compact size reduces the computational burdens and computing device requirements, and thus such an engine can be more clinically applicable.

AB This letter provides an approximate online adaptive solution to the infinite-horizon optimal control problem for control-affine continuous-time nonlinear systems while formalizing system safety using barrier certificates. The use of a barrier function transform provides safety certificates to formalize system behavior. Specifically, using a barrier function, the system is transformed to aid in developing a controller which maintains the system in a pre-defined constrained region. To aid in online learning of the value function, the state-space is segmented into a number of user-defined segments. Off-policy trajectories are selected in each segment, and sparse Bellman error extrapolation is performed within each respective segment to generate an optimal policy within each segment. A Lyapunov-like stability analysis is included which proves uniformly ultimately bounded regulation in the presence of the barrier function transform and discontinuities. Simulation results are provided for a two-state dynamical system to compare the performance of the developed method to existing methods.

AB Introduction: Our objective was to test the ability of ChatGPT 4.0 to provide accurate information for patients and physicians about abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) and to assess its alignment with Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) clinical practice guidelines (CPG) for AAA care. Material and methods: Fifteen patient-level questions, 37 questions selected to reflect 28 SVS CPGs and 4 questions regarding AAA rupture risk were posed to ChatGPT 4.0. Single responses were recorded and graded for accuracy and quality by ten board-certified vascular surgeons as well as two fellow trainees using a 5-point Likert scale; 1 = very poor, 2 = poor, 3 = fair, 4 = good, and 5 = excellent. Results: The mean of the means (MoM) accuracy rating across all 15 patient-level questions was 4.4 (SD 0.4, quartile range (QR) 4.2-4.7). ChatGPT 4.0 demonstrated good alignment with SVS practice guidelines (MoM: 4.2, SD: 0.4, QR: 3.9-4.5). The accuracy of responses was consistent across guideline categories; screening or surveillance (4.2), indications for surgery (4.5), preoperative risk assessment (4.5), perioperative coronary revascularization (4.1), and perioperative management (4.2). The generative artificial intelligence bot demonstrated only fair performance in answering the annual AAA rupture risk (MoM: 3.4, SD: 1.2, QR: 2.3-4.3). Conclusions: ChatGPT 4.0 provided accurate responses to a variety of patient-level questions regarding AAA. Responses were well-aligned with current SVS CPGs except for inaccuracies in the risk of AAA rupture at varying diameters. The emergence of generative artificial intelligence bots presents an opportunity for study of applications in patient education and to determine their ability to augment the vascular specialist's knowledge base.

AB Premise: Plant trait data are essential for quantifying biodiversity and function across Earth, but these data are challenging to acquire for large studies. Diverse strategies are needed, including the liberation of heritage data locked within specialist literature such as floras and taxonomic monographs. Here we report FloraTraiter, a novel approach using rule-based natural language processing (NLP) to parse computable trait data from biodiversity literature.Methods: FloraTraiter was implemented through collaborative work between programmers and botanical experts and customized for both online floras and scanned literature. We report a strategy spanning optical character recognition, recognition of taxa, iterative building of traits, and establishing linkages among all of these, as well as curational tools and code for turning these results into standard morphological matrices.Results: Over 95% of treatment content was successfully parsed for traits with <1% error. Data for more than 700 taxa are reported, including a demonstration of common downstream uses.Conclusions: We identify strategies, applications, tips, and challenges that we hope will facilitate future similar efforts to produce large open-source trait data sets for broad community reuse. Largely automated tools like FloraTraiter will be an important addition to the toolkit for assembling trait data at scale.

AB Study Objectives Genetics impacts sleep, yet, the molecular mechanisms underlying sleep regulation remain elusive. In this study, we built machine learning models to predict sleep genes based on their similarity to genes that are known to regulate sleep. Methods We trained a prediction model on thousands of published datasets, representing circadian, immune, sleep deprivation, and many other processes, using a manually curated list of 109 sleep genes. Results Our predictions fit with prior knowledge of sleep regulation and identified key genes and pathways to pursue in follow-up studies. As an example, we focused on the NF-kappa B pathway and showed that chronic activation of NF-kappa B in a genetic mouse model impacted the sleep-wake patterns. Conclusion Our study highlights the power of machine learning in integrating prior knowledge and genome-wide data to study genetic regulation of complex behaviors such as sleep.

On the basis of analyze the nonlinear and non-stationary characteristics of underwater target signals, in order to improve the detection performance of active sonar, the hierarchical refined multi-scale fluctuation-based dispersion entropy (HRCMFDE) method is proposed and used to extract the features of underwater target signals. Firstly, the HRCMFDE method is used to extract features from underwater target signals, and the extracted HRCMFDE feature vectors are used to form the feature set. Secondly, genetic algorithm (GA) was used to optimize the input weights and hidden layer bias of extreme learning machine (ELM), and an improved ELM algorithm was proposed to establish the recognition model for underwater target signals. Finally, a sample library of five types of targets was constructed based on the measured underwater target signals, and feature extraction was performed. The performance of the extracted features was tested through improved ELM classification, and the classification results obtained verified the effectiveness of the proposed feature extraction method.

AB Neuronal ensembles in the medial prefrontal cortex mediate cocaine self-administration via projections to the nucleus accumbens. We have recently shown that neuronal ensembles in the prelimbic cortex form rapidly to mediate cocaine self-administration. However, the role of neuronal ensembles within the nucleus accumbens in initial cocaine-seeking behaviour remains unknown. Here, we sought to expand the current literature by testing the necessity of the cocaine self-administration ensemble in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcCore) 1 day after male and female rats acquire cocaine self-administration by using the Daun02 inactivation procedure. We found that disrupting the NAcCore ensembles after a no-cocaine reward-seeking test increased subsequent cocaine seeking, while disrupting NAcCore ensembles following a cocaine self-administration session decreased subsequent cocaine seeking. We then characterized neuronal cell type in the NAcCore using RNAscope in situ hybridization. In the no-cocaine session, we saw reduced dopamine D1 type neuronal activation, while in the cocaine self-administration session, we found preferential dopamine D1 type neuronal activity in the NAcCore.

AB Image restoration (IR) has been extensively studied with lots of excellent strategies accumulated over the years. However, most existing methods still have large room for improvement. In this paper, we boost an unsupervised iterative feature refinement model (IFR) with the enhanced high-dimensional deep mean-shift prior (EDMSP), termed IFR-EDMSP. The proposed model inherits the fantastic noise suppression characteristic of embedded network and the fine detail preservation ability of IFR model. Moreover, based on the fact that multiple implementations of artificial noise in prior learning improve underlying representation capability, three-sigma rule is adopted in IFR-EDMSP for accurate and robust results. Extensive experiments demonstrated that IFR-EDMSP outperforms the typical methods in compressed sensing, image deblurring and super-resolution.

AB Sleep medicine is well positioned to benefit from advances that use big data to create artificially intelligent computer programs. One obvious initial application in the sleep disorders center is the assisted (or enhanced) scoring of sleep and associated events during polysomnography (PSG). This position statement outlines the potential opportunities and limitations of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into the practice of sleep medicine. Additionally, although the most apparent and immediate application of AI in ourfield is the assisted scoring of PSG, we propose potential clinical use cases that transcend the sleep laboratory and are expected to deepen our understanding of sleep disorders, improve patient-centered sleep care, augment day-to-day clinical operations, and increase our knowledge of the role of sleep in health at a population level.

AB Melanoma is considered to be the most serious and aggressive type of skin cancer, and metastasis appears to be the most important factor in its prognosis. Herein, we developed a transfer learning-based biomarker discovery model that could aid in the diagnosis and prognosis of this disease. After applying it to the ensemble machine learning model, results revealed that the genes found were consistent with those found using other methodologies previously applied to the same TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) data set. Further novel biomarkers were also found. Our ensemble model achieved an AUC of 0.9861, an accuracy of 91.05, and an F1 score of 90.60 using an independent validation data set. This study was able to identify potential genes for diagnostic classification (C7 and GRIK5) and diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers (S100A7, S100A7, KRT14, KRT17, KRT6B, KRTDAP, SERPINB4, TSHR, PVRL4, WFDC5, IL20RB) in melanoma. The results show the utility of a transfer learning approach for biomarker discovery in melanoma.

TI Electronic Health Record Data Quality and Performance Assessments:
   Scoping Review
SO JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS
LA English
DT Review
ID RULES; TOOL
AB Background: Electronic health records (EHRs) have an enormous potential to advance medical research and practice through easily accessible and interpretable EHR-derived databases. Attainability of this potential is limited by issues with data quality (DQ) and performance assessment. Objective: This review aims to streamline the current best practices on EHR DQ and performance assessments as a replicable standard for researchers in the field. Methods: PubMed was systematically searched for original research articles assessing EHR DQ and performance from inception until May 7, 2023. Results: Our search yielded 26 original research articles. Most articles had 1 or more significant limitations, including incomplete or inconsistent reporting (n=6, 30%), poor replicability (n=5, 25%), and limited generalizability of results (n=5, 25%). Completeness (n=21, 81%), conformance (n=18, 69%), and plausibility (n=16, 62%) were the most cited indicators of DQ, while correctness or accuracy (n=14, 54%) was most cited for data performance, with context-specific supplementation by recency (n=7, 27%), fairness (n=6, 23%), stability (n=4, 15%), and shareability (n=2, 8%) assessments. Artificial intelligence-based techniques, including natural language data extraction, data imputation, and fairness algorithms, were demonstrated to play a rising role in improving both dataset quality and performance. Conclusions: This review highlights the need for incentivizing DQ and performance assessments and their standardization. The results suggest the usefulness of artificial intelligence-based techniques for enhancing DQ and performance to unlock the full potential of EHRs to improve medical research and practice.

AB Mitigation of seismic risk is a challenge for 70+ countries in the world. Screening the building stock for potential structural defects is one way to locate structures that are vulnerable to strong ground motion. Often in developing countries, masonry buildings are not reinforced or confined to withstand earthquake loads. It has been observed that such buildings cannot withstand the lateral loads imposed by an earthquake. An estimated 77 percent of the fatalities in the earthquakes during the last 100 years were caused mainly by the collapse of masonry buildings. Given the probability of severe damage or collapse in the event of an earthquake, identification and retrofit of such masonry buildings are critical. Screening of masonry buildings by conventional methods is usually a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. This research presents an automated workflow for segmenting the presence of such buildings through the use of street-view images. The method uses deep learning techniques. An inventory composed of a set of street view images was collected from the streets of Oaxaca State, Mexico using a 360 degrees camera mounted on a car. These images were then annotated by trained engineers. Using the annotated dataset, an instance segmentation model was trained to detect and classify masonry buildings from the street view images. Using the model, we performed city scale detections of masonry buildings. We found the spatial distribution pattern of masonry buildings is correlated with the urbanization paths of the cities. The model could be used to produce large-scale automated detection of buildings at a fraction of the cost and in the fraction of the time of the alternatives. With affordable, accurate and massive screenings, governments can target these buildings for retrofit efforts and companies can assess the business opportunity of prevention (or "Building Better Before").

TI Application of machine learning to the prediction of postoperative
   sepsis after appendectomy
SO SURGERY
LA English
DT Article
AB Background: We applied various machine learning algorithms to a large national dataset to model the risk of postoperative sepsis after appendectomy to evaluate utility of such methods and identify factors associated with postoperative sepsis in these patients.
   Methods: The National Surgery Quality Improvement Program database was used to identify patients undergoing appendectomy between 2005 and 2017. Logistic regression, support vector machines, random forest decision trees, and extreme gradient boosting machines were used to model the occurrence of postoperative sepsis.
   Results: In the study, 223,214 appendectomies were identified; 2,143 (0.96%) were indicated as having postoperative sepsis. Logistic regression (area under the curve 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.68-0.73), random forest decision trees (area under the curve 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.68-0.73), and extreme gradient boosting (area under the curve 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.68-0.73) afforded similar performance, while support vector machines (area under the curve 0.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.50-0.52) had worse performance. Variable importance analyses identified preoperative congestive heart failure, transfusion, and acute renal failure as predictors of postoperative sepsis.
   Conclusion: Machine learning methods can be used to predict the development of sepsis after appendectomy with moderate accuracy. Such predictive modeling has potential to ultimately allow for preoperative recognition of patients at risk for developing postoperative sepsis after appendectomy thus facilitating early intervention and reducing morbidity.

AB Mode conversion of P waves at the boundary between Earth's crust and upper mantle, when analysed using receiver functions (RFs), allows characterization of Earth structure where seismic station density is high and earthquake sources are favourably distributed. We applied two ensemble decision tree algorithms-Random Forest (RanFor) and eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost)-to synthetic and real RF data to assess these machine learning techniques' potential for crustal imaging when available data are sparse. The synthetic RFs, entailing both sharp increases in seismic velocity across the Moho and gradational Moho structures, calculated with and without added random noise, correspond to idealized crustal structures: a dipping Moho, Moho offset by crustal-scale faults, anti- and synform Moho structures and combinations of these. The RanFor/XGBoost algorithm recovers input structures well regardless of event-station distributions. Useful crustal and upper mantle seismic velocities can also be determined using RanFor and XGBoost, making it possible to image crustal thickness and P- and S-wave velocities simultaneously from RFs alone. We applied the trained RanFor/XGBoost to RFs determined from real seismic data recorded in the contiguous United States, producing a map of the Moho and P- and S-wave velocities of the lowermost crust and uppermost mantle. Use of XGBoost, which evaluates residuals between input RFs and ground-truth to update the decision tree using the gradient of a penalty function, improves the crustal thickness estimates.

AB Hardware obfuscating is a proactive design-for-trust technique against IC supply chain threats, i.e., IP piracy and overproduction. Many studies have evaluated numerous techniques for obfuscation purposes. Nevertheless, de-obfuscation attacks have demonstrated their insufficiency. This paper proposes a register-transfer (RT) level finite-state-machine (FSM) obfuscation technique called ReTrustFSM that allows designers to obfuscate at the earliest possible stage. ReTrustFSM combines three types of secrecy: explicit external secrecy via an external key, implicit external secrecy based on specific clock cycles, and internal secrecy through a concealed FSM transition function. So, the robustness of ReTrustFSM relies on the external key, the external primary input patterns, and the cycle accuracy of applying such external stimuli. Additionally, ReTrustFSM defines a cohesive relationship between the features of Boolean problems and the required time for de-obfuscation, ensuring a maximum execution time for oracle-guided de-obfuscation attacks. Various attacks are employed to test ReTrustFSM's robustness, including structural and machine learning attacks, functional I/O queries (BMC), and FSM attacks. We have also analyzed the corruptibility and overhead of design-under-obfuscation. Our experimental results demonstrate the robustness of ReTrustFSM at acceptable overhead/corruption while resisting such threat models.

AB Early pregnancy loss markedly impacts reproductive efficiency in cattle. The objectives were to model a biologically relevant gene signature predicting embryonic competence for survival after integrating transcriptomic data from blastocysts and elongating conceptuses with different developmental capacities and to validate the potential biomarkers with independent embryonic data sets through the application of machine-learning algorithms. First, two data sets from in vivo-produced blastocysts competent or not to sustain a pregnancy were integrated with a data set from long and short day-15 conceptuses. A statistical contrast determined differentially expressed genes (DEG) increasing in expression from a competent blastocyst to a long conceptus and vice versa; these were enriched for KEGG pathways related to glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and RNA processing, respectively. Next, the most discriminative DEG between blastocysts that resulted or did not in pregnancy were selected by linear discriminant analysis. These eight putative biomarker genes were validated by modeling their expression in competent or noncompetent blastocysts through Bayesian logistic regression or neural networks and predicting embryo developmental fate in four external data sets consisting of in vitro-produced blastocysts (i) competent or not, or (ii) exposed or not to detrimental conditions during culture, and elongated conceptuses (iii) of different length, or (iv) developed in the uteri of high- or subfertile heifers. Predictions for each data set were more than 85% accurate, suggesting that these genes play a key role in embryo development and pregnancy establishment. In conclusion, this study integrated transcriptomic data from seven independent experiments to identify a small set of genes capable of predicting embryonic competence for survival.

AB A study has been made of the effect of using different numbers of hidden units in a neural network modeling of the aqueous solubility of a wide range of organic compounds. A training set of 331 compounds was used and the trained neural network was tested on a prediction set of 19 Compounds. Between two and five hidden units were used with varying numbers of iterations. Comparisons are made with the results obtained from our previous studies, one which used a neural network with 18 hidden units and another based on regression analysis. By using a smaller number of hidden units in this study, better performance has been obtained than either of the previous studies.

AB This study is among the first to develop different prototypes of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) chatbots powered by GPT-4 to communicate hurricane preparedness information to diverse residents. Drawing from the Computers Are Social Actors paradigm and the literature on disaster vulnerability and cultural tailoring, we conducted a between-subjects experiment with 441 Black, Hispanic, and Caucasian residents of Florida. Our results suggest that GenAI chatbots varying in tone formality and cultural tailoring significantly influence perceptions of their friendliness and credibility, which, in turn, relate to hurricane preparedness outcomes. These results highlight the potential of using GenAI chatbots to improve diverse communities' disaster preparedness.
   This study looks at how generative artificial intelligence (genAI) chatbots help individuals from different racial groups prepare for hurricanes in Florida. We create and test GPT-4 chatbots that use different tones and tailor their messages to fit people's cultural backgrounds. Our results show that chatbots with an informal tone are seen as more friendly, whereas those with either a formal tone or one that fits people's cultural backgrounds are seen as more credible. Credible chatbots encourage people to seek, share, and act on disaster information. Overall, GenAI chatbots can create human-like and culturally-sensitive disaster communication for diverse communities.

AB Biohazards, which may occur at all supply chain stages, pose significant threats to food safety and public health. Addressing these concerns and enhancing food safety necessitates a nondestructive pathogen surveillance approach capable of continuously and simultaneously detecting multiple pathogens. Detecting and differentiating low concentrations of pathogenic bacteria amid high background microflora levels in foods is challenging, requiring technology with high sensitivity and robust discriminatory capability. This study introduces an artificial neural network-driven paper chromogenic array sensor (ANN-PCA) technique developed for the nondestructive, continuous, and simultaneous detection of Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) and Escherichia coli O157:H7 (Ec) from a high background microflora in shredded cheddar cheese. This method enables accurate detection of SE and Ec in monoculture and cocktail culture while distinguishing them from a high level of background microflora (similar to 7.5 log CFU/g), with accuracies ranging from 72 +/- 11% to 92 +/- 3%. In addition, SE and Ec were successfully identified at concentrations as low as 1 log CFU/g within one day, with an accuracy of 72 +/- 11%. This approach exhibits promising potential for integration into a digitalized, smart, and resilient nondestructive surveillance system for real-time pathogen detection in foods throughout the supply chain without enrichment, incubation, or other sample preparation steps.

AB The construction industry is integrating robots into critical tasks at an accelerated pace, with the aim of enhancing efficiency, safety, and productivity. However, construction tasks requiring dexterity remain a challenge due to the need for precise movements, accurate perception, real-time decision-making, and a comprehensive understanding of the environment. To address these challenges, the introduction of embodied artificial intelligence (AI) represents a significant shift in robotic capabilities to enhance their alignment with the broader spectrum of construction settings. Rooted in cognitive science, embodied AI emphasizes the integration of an agent's physical form into its computational intelligence processes. It resembles how humans develop motor skills by interacting with physical world. This paper introduces DEXBOT, an exploratory framework for designing construction robots capable of high dexterity using embodied AI principles that mimics human strategies in complex tasks. The framework outlines six key perspectives for solving high-dexterity tasks with embodied AI: scene understanding, localization and motion planning, position-based control, force-based control, sequence planning, and correction decision-making. By presenting preliminary test cases for each perspective, the paper emphasizes the role of embodied AI in advancing dexterity level of construction robots. The DEXBOT framework is expected to encourage interdisciplinary collaboration of designing capable construction robots in the future.

AB A neural network based on Artificial Resonance Theory (ART-map) was used to predict and compensate the tool point errors of a 3-axis machining center using discrete temperature readings from the machine's structure as inputs. A combination of kinematic error modeling, curve fitting, and the neural network were used to maintain the machine's three-dimensional (3-D) accuracy within +/-7.4 mum, regardless of the thermal state. The network model was evaluated with diagonal measurements and part machining tests. A laser ball bar was used to take the necessary measurements for training the neural network.

AB Background: The majority of suicide attempters do not disclose suicide ideation (SI) prior to making an attempt. When reported, SI is nevertheless associated with increased risk of suicide. This paper implemented machine learning (ML) approaches to assess the degree to which current and lifetime SI affect the predictive validity of the Suicide Crisis Syndrome (SCS), an acute condition indicative of imminent risk, for near-term suicidal behaviors (SB ). Methods: In a sample of 591 high-risk inpatient participants, SCS and SI were respectively assessed using the Suicide Crisis Inventory (SCI) and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Two ML predictive algorithms, Random Forest and XGBoost, were implemented and framed using optimism adjusted bootstrapping. Metrics collected included AUPRC, AUROC, classification accuracy, balanced accuracy, precision, recall, and brier score. AUROC metrics were compared by computing a z-score. Results: The combination of current SI and SCI showed slightly higher predictive validity for near-term SB as evidenced by AUROC metrics than the SCI alone, but the difference was not significant (p<0.05). Current SI scored the highest amongst a chi square distribution in regards to predictors of near-term SB. Conclusion: The addition of SI to the SCS does not materially improve the model's predictive validity for near term SB, suggesting that patient self-reported SI should not be a requirement for the diagnosis of SCS.

AB In recent years, many neuroimaging studies have applied artificial intelligence (AI) to facilitate existing challenges in Parkinson's disease (PD) diagnosis, prognosis, and intervention. The aim of this systematic review was to provide an overview of neuroimaging-based AI studies and to assess their methodological quality. A PubMed search yielded 810 studies, of which 244 that investigated the utility of neuroimaging-based AI for PD diagnosis, prognosis, or intervention were included. We systematically categorized studies by outcomes and rated them with respect to five minimal quality criteria (MQC) pertaining to data splitting, data leakage, model complexity, performance reporting, and indication of biological plausibility. We found that the majority of studies aimed to distinguish PD patients from healthy controls (54%) or atypical parkinsonian syndromes (25%), whereas prognostic or interventional studies were sparse. Only 20% of evaluated studies passed all five MQC, with data leakage, non-minimal model complexity, and reporting of biological plausibility as the primary factors for quality loss. Data leakage was associated with a significant inflation of accuracies. Very few studies employed external test sets (8%), where accuracy was significantly lower, and 19% of studies did not account for data imbalance. Adherence to MQC was low across all observed years and journal impact factors. This review outlines that AI has been applied to a wide variety of research questions pertaining to PD; however, the number of studies failing to pass the MQC is alarming. Therefore, we provide recommendations to enhance the interpretability, generalizability, and clinical utility of future AI applications using neuroimaging in PD. (c) 2024 The Author(s).

ID EXPLORATION
AB In this paper, we propose an information-theoretic exploration strategy for stochastic, discrete multi-armed bandits that achieves optimal regret. Our strategy is based on the value of information criterion. This criterion measures the trade-off between policy information and obtainable rewards. High amounts of policy information are associated with exploration-dominant searches of the space and yield high rewards. Low amounts of policy information favor the exploitation of existing knowledge. Information, in this criterion, is quantified by a parameter that can be varied during search. We demonstrate that a simulated-annealing-like update of this parameter, with a sufficiently fast cooling schedule, leads to a regret that is logarithmic with respect to the number of arm pulls.

AB Monitoring crops and producing correct yield estimates are both crucial components of decision-making in agricultural systems. This is particularly important for crops like maize, with a national gross production value above US $82 billion in 2021. Several crop parameters, e.g., plant height (PH), leaf nutrient status, etc., are in use for improving maize grain yield (MGY) prediction models. Traditional PH measurements can be time-consuming and labor-intensive; thus, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) might be efficient and practical tools to predict in-season MGY. Two small-plot trials were conducted in North Florida to estimate in-field PH (IFPH) using UAVs (UAV-PH) and compare different regression approaches to estimate MGY using different time points (from 17 to 133 days after planting [DAP]). A multispectral camera was mounted onto an Aurelia X6 Standard hexacopter to capture crop canopy height. Overall, the IFPH values were higher than UAV-PH but strongly correlated (r = 0.95). Moderate to strong correlations were observed between MGY and PH at all time points except 17 DAP. The prediction of MGY using IFPH or UAV-PH was better through machine learning algorithms (Random forest re-gressor [RFR] and Support vector regression [SVR]) compared to simple/multiple linear regression (S/MLR), with R-2, MAE, RMSE, and nRMSE ranges of 0.91-0.94, 553.86-1574.62 kg ha(-1), 708.94-195.04 kg ha(-1), and 14.2-39.1 % for best-performing models of RFR and SVR, respectively. Furthermore, S/MLR usually over-estimated low-yielding plots (MGY < 12000 kg ha(-1)) and underestimated high-yielding plots (MGY > 12000 kg ha(-1)). The results showed that UAVs are a potential tool for quicker decision-making in maize cropping systems in North Florida since the crop-height model accurately estimated ground PH measurements (IFPH) at different time points.

AB Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is widely investigated as a therapeutic tool to enhance cognitive function in older adults with and without neurodegenerative disease. Prior research demonstrates that electric current delivery to the brain can vary significantly across individuals. Quantification of this variability could enable person-specific optimization of tDCS outcomes. This pilot study used machine learning and MRI-derived electric field models to predict working memory improvements as a proof of concept for precision cognitive intervention.
   Methods: Fourteen healthy older adults received 20 minutes of 2 mA tDCS stimulation (F3/F4) during a two-week cognitive training intervention. Participants performed an N-back working memory task pre-/ post-intervention. MRI-derived current models were passed through a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning algorithm to characterize crucial tDCS current components (intensity and direction) that induced working memory improvements in tDCS responders versus non-responders.
   Main results: SVM models of tDCS current components had 86% overall accuracy in classifying treatment responders vs. non-responders, with current intensity producing the best overall model differentiating changes in working memory performance. Median current intensity and direction in brain regions near the electrodes were positively related to intervention responses (r = 0.811, p < 0.001 and r = 0.774, p = 0.001).
   Conclusions: This study provides the first evidence that pattern recognition analyses of MRI-derived tDCS current models can provide individual prognostic classification of tDCS treatment response with 86% accuracy. Individual differences in current intensity and direction play important roles in determining treatment response to tDCS. These findings provide important insights into mechanisms of tDCS response as well as proof of concept for future precision dosing models of tDCS intervention. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB Background: The prevalence of adolescent mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety has significantly increased. Despite the potential of machine learning (ML), there is a shortage of models that use real-world data (RWD) to enhance early detection and intervention for these conditions. Objective: This study aimed to identify depression and anxiety in adolescents using ML techniques on RWD and social determinants of health (SDoH). Methods: We analyzed RWD of adolescents aged 10-17 years, considering various factors such as demographics, prior diagnoses, prescribed medications, medical procedures, and laboratory measurements recorded before the onset of anxiety or depression. Clinical data were linked with SDoH at the block-level. Three separate models were developed to predict anxiety, depression, and both conditions. Our ML model of choice was Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and we evaluated its performance using the nested cross-validation technique. To interpret the model predictions, we used the Shapley additive explanation method. Results: Our cohort included 52,054 adolescents, identifying 12,572 with anxiety, 7812 with depression, and 14,019 with either condition. The models achieved area under the curve values of 0.80 for anxiety, 0.81 for depression, and 0.78 for both combined. Excluding SDoH data had a minimal impact on model performance. Shapley additive explanation analysis identified gender, race, educational attainment, and various medical factors as key predictors of anxiety and depression. Conclusions: This study highlights the potential of ML in early identification of depression and anxiety in adolescents using RWD. By leveraging RWD, health care providers may more precisely identify at-risk adolescents and intervene earlier, potentially leading to improved mental health outcomes.

AB This article explains the use of supervised and unsupervised dictionary learning approaches on spread spectrum time domain (SSTDR) data to detect and locate disconnections in a PV array consisting of five panels. The aim is to decompose an SSTDR reflection signature into different components where each component has a physical interpretation, such as noise, environmental effects, and faults. In the unsupervised dictionary learning approach, the decomposed components are inspected to detect and localize faults. The maximum difference between actual and predicted location of the fault is 0.44 m on a system with five panels connected to an SSTDR box with a leader cable of 59.13 m and total length of 67.36 m including the effective length of the panels. In the supervised dictionary learning approach, the dictionary components are used to classify the SSTDR data to their respective fault types. Our results show a 97% accuracy using the supervised learning approach.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI) and related technologies are transforming many consumption activities, powering breakthroughs that expand the human experience by enhancing human capabilities, performance, and creativity. While this explains the consumer enthusiasm and rapid adoption of these technologies, AI systems can also have the opposite effect: reducing and constraining the range of experiences that are available to consumers. This article examines the mechanisms through which AI can constrain the human experience, considering individual, interpersonal, and societal processes. Our analysis uncovers a complex interplay between the advantages of AI and its inadvertent negative repercussions, which potentially restrict human autonomy, self-identity, relational dynamics, and social behavior. In this article, we propose three different mechanisms at the core of these constraining forces: parametric reductionism, agency transference, and regulated expression. Our exploration of these mechanisms highlights the risks connected to system design and points to questions and implications for future researchers and policymakers.

AB Rapidly synthesizing high-quality two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) is crucial for their practical applications. While strategies such as slow monomer addition have been developed based on an empirical understanding of their formation process, quantitative guidance remains absent, which prohibits precise optimizations of the experimental conditions. Here, we use a machine-learning approach that overcomes the challenges associated with bottom-up model derivation for the non-classical 2D COF crystallization processes. The resulting model, referred to as NEgen1, establishes correlations among the induction time, nucleation rate, growth rate, bond-forming rate constants, and common solution synthesis conditions for 2D COFs that grow by a nucleation-elongation mechanism. The results elucidate the detailed competition between the nucleation and growth dynamics in solution, which has been inappropriately described previously by classical, empirical models with assumptions invalid for 2D COF polymerization. By understanding the dynamic processes at play, the NEgen1 model reveals a simple strategy of gradually increasing monomer addition speed for growing large 2D COF crystals. This insight enables us to rapidly synthesize large COF-5 colloids, which could only be achieved previously by prolonged reaction times or by introducing chemical modulators. These results highlight the potential for systematically improving the crystal quality of 2D COFs, which has wide-reaching relevance for many of the applications where 2D COFs are speculated to be valuable.
   A machine-learning approach is used to derive a non-classical model that describes the crystallization of two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (2D COFs) in a homogeneous solution. This model reveals that gradually increasing monomer addition speed increases the speed of 2D COF crystal growth. The insights provided by this model led us to rapidly synthesize large COF-5 colloids, which was previously achieved with prolonged reaction times or by introducing chemical modulators. image

AB Polysomnography remains the cornerstone of objective testing in sleep medicine and results in massive amounts of electrophysiological data, which is well-suited for analysis with artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools. Combined with other sources of health data, AI is expected to provide new insights to inform the clinical care of sleep disorders and advance our understanding of the integral role sleep plays in human health. Additionally, AI has the potential to streamline day-to-day operations and therefore optimize direct patient care by the sleep disorders team. However, clinicians, scientists, and other stakeholders must develop best practices to integrate this rapidly evolving technology into our daily work while maintaining the highest degree of quality and transparency in health care and research. Ultimately, when harnessed appropriately in conjunction with human expertise, AI will improve the practice of sleep medicine and further sleep science for the health and well-being of our patients.

AB Simple Summary Bladder cancer segmentation on MRI images is critical to determine if the cancer spread to the nearby muscles. In this study, we aimed to assess the performance of three deep learning models in outlining bladder tumors from MRI images. Using the MRI data of 53 patients, we trained Unet, MAnet, and PSPnet models to segment tumors using different loss functions and evaluated their performances. The results showed MAnet and PSPnet models performed better overall in segmenting bladder tumors, especially when they used a hybrid loss function (CE+DSC). Our findings could improve the way bladder cancer is segmented on MRI images, potentially leading to a better choice of deep learning algorithms and loss functions for future research.Abstract Background: Bladder cancer (BC) segmentation on MRI images is the first step to determining the presence of muscular invasion. This study aimed to assess the tumor segmentation performance of three deep learning (DL) models on multi-parametric MRI (mp-MRI) images. Methods: We studied 53 patients with bladder cancer. Bladder tumors were segmented on each slice of T2-weighted (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging/apparent diffusion coefficient (DWI/ADC), and T1-weighted contrast-enhanced (T1WI) images acquired at a 3Tesla MRI scanner. We trained Unet, MAnet, and PSPnet using three loss functions: cross-entropy (CE), dice similarity coefficient loss (DSC), and focal loss (FL). We evaluated the model performances using DSC, Hausdorff distance (HD), and expected calibration error (ECE). Results: The MAnet algorithm with the CE+DSC loss function gave the highest DSC values on the ADC, T2WI, and T1WI images. PSPnet with CE+DSC obtained the smallest HDs on the ADC, T2WI, and T1WI images. The segmentation accuracy overall was better on the ADC and T1WI than on the T2WI. The ECEs were the smallest for PSPnet with FL on the ADC images, while they were the smallest for MAnet with CE+DSC on the T2WI and T1WI. Conclusions: Compared to Unet, MAnet and PSPnet with a hybrid CE+DSC loss function displayed better performances in BC segmentation depending on the choice of the evaluation metric.

AB Characterizing oxide nuclear fuels is difficult due to complex fission products, which result from time-evolving system chemistry and extreme operating environments. Here, we report a machine learning-enhanced approach that accelerates the characterization of spent nuclear fuels and improves the accuracy of identifying nanophase fission products and bubbles. We apply this approach to commercial, high-burnup, irradiated light-water reactor fuels, demonstrating relationships between fission product precipitates and gases. We also gain understanding of the fission versus decay pathways of precipitates across the radius of a fuel pellet. An algorithm is provided for quantifying the chemical segregation of the fission products with respect to the high-burnup structure, which enhances our ability to process large amounts of microscopy data, including approaching the atomistic-scale. This may provide a faster route for achieving physics-based fuel performance modeling.
   Characterizing fission products in uranium dioxide nuclear fuel is important for predicting its long-term properties. Here, machine learning is used to mine microscopy images of precipitates and nanoscale gas bubbles in high-burn-up fuels, providing detailed structural insight of nanoscale fission products.

AB The Computers are Social Actors (CASA) paradigm was proposed more than two decades ago to understand humans' interaction with computer technologies. Today, as emerging technologies like social robots become more personal and persuasive, questions of how users respond to them socially, what individual factors leverage the relationship, and what constitutes the social influence of these technologies need to be addressed. A lab experiment was conducted to examine the interactions between individual differences and social robots' vocal and kinetic cues. Results suggested that users developed more trust in a social robot with a human voice than with a synthetic voice. Users also developed more intimacy and interest in the social robot when it was paired with humanlike gestures. Moreover, individual differences including users' gender, attitudes toward robots, and robot exposure affected their psychological responses. The theoretical, practical, and ethical value of the findings was further discussed in the study.

AB The Mexican institute of Water Technology (IMTA) developed a highly interactive computational system for the distribution and management of water, SICODE. This software suggests alternatives and provides criteria for the management of the irrigation systems and makes the manager's task of delivering water in the volume and opportunity desired, easier. It includes a module which computes real time irrigation using an automated weather station; a soil water balance module, and a Geographic Information System (GIS), that displays the entire irrigation system and its subdivisions, crops and zones of interest. A biological simulation program is also included. SICODE introduces a new approach to incorporating artificial intelligence by means of an expert system that uses soil water balance data to assist in management decision -making to assign irrigation priorities to crops. The software is being validated in the irrigation district at Delicias, Chihuahua. SICODE can be implemented at any site for which the necessary information is available.

AB This paper provides a methodology for detecting management fraud using basic financial data. The methodology is based on support vector machines. An important aspect therein is a kernel that increases the power of the learning machine by allowing an implicit and generally nonlinear mapping of points, usually into a higher dimensional feature space. A kernel specific to the domain of finance is developed. This financial kernel constructs features shown in prior research to be helpful in detecting management fraud. A large empirical data set was collected, which included quantitative financial attributes for fraudulent and nonfraudulent public companies. Support vector machines using the financial kernel correctly labeled 80% of the fraudulent cases and 90.6% of the nonfraudulent cases on a holdout set. Furthermore, we replicate other leading fraud research studies using our data and find that our method has the highest accuracy on fraudulent cases and competitive accuracy on nonfraudulent cases. The results validate the financial kernel together with support vector machines as a useful method for discriminating between fraudulent and nonfraudulent companies using only publicly available quantitative financial attributes. The results also show that the methodology has predictive value because, using only historical data, it was able to distinguish fraudulent from nonfraudulent companies in subsequent years.

AB In this paper we develop a new framework for time series segmentation based on a Hierarchical Linear Dynamical System (HLDS), and test its performance on monophonic and polyphonic musical note recognition. The center piece of our approach is the inclusion of constraints in the filter topology, instead of on the cost function as normally done in machine learning. Just by slowing down the dynamics of the top layer of an augmented (multilayer) state model, which is still compatible with the recursive update equation proposed originally by Kalman, the system learns directly from data all the musical notes, without labels, effectively creating a time series clustering algorithm that does not require segmentation. We analyze the HLDS properties and show that it provides better classification accuracy compared to current state-of-the-art approaches. (c) 2017 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective To estimate the therapeutic inertia prevalence for patients with type 2 diabetes, develop and validate a machine learning model predicting therapeutic inertia, and determine the added predictive value of area-level social determinants of health (SDOH).Methods This prognostic study with a retrospective cohort design used OneFlorida data (linked electronic health records (EHRs) from 1240 practices/clinics in Florida). The study cohort included adults (aged >= 18) with type 2 diabetes, HbA1C >= 7% (53 mmol/mol), >= one ambulatory visit, and >= one antihyperglycemic medication prescribed (excluded patients prescribed insulin before HbA1C). The outcome was therapeutic inertia, defined as absence of treatment intensification within six months after HbA1C >= 7% (53 mmol/mol). The predictors were patient, provider, and healthcare system factors. Machine learning methods included gradient boosting machines (GBM), random forests (RF), elastic net (EN), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). The DeLong test compared the discriminative ability (represented by C-statistics) between models.Results The cohort included 31,087 patients with type 2 diabetes (mean age = 58.89 (SD = 13.27) years, 50.50% male, 58.89% White). The therapeutic inertia prevalence was 39.80% among the 68,445 records. GBM outperformed (C-statistic from testing sample = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.83-0.84) RF (C-statistic = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.79-0.80), EN (C-statistic = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.80-0.81), and LASSO (C-statistic = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.80-0.81), p < 0.05. Area-level SDOH significantly increased the discriminative ability versus models without SDOH (C-statistic for GBM = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.84-0.85 vs. 0.84, 95% CI = 0.83-0.84), p < 0.05.Conclusions Using EHRs of patients with type 2 diabetes from a large state, machine learning predicted therapeutic inertia (prevalence = 40%). The model's ability to predict patients at high risk of therapeutic inertia is clinically applicable to diabetes care.

AB Aim: The aim of this study is to present the possibilities of nurse education in the use of the Chat Generative Pretraining Transformer (ChatGPT) tool to support the documentation process. Background: The success of the nursing process is based on the accuracy of nursing diagnoses, which also determine nursing interventions and nursing outcomes. Educating nurses in the use of artificial intelligence in the nursing process can significantly reduce the time nurses spend on documentation. Design: Discussion paper. Methods: We used a case study from Train4Health in the field of preventive care to demonstrate the potential of using Generative Pre -training Transformer (ChatGPT) to educate nurses in documenting the nursing process using generative artificial intelligence. Based on the case study, we entered a description of the patient's condition into Generative Pre -training Transformer (ChatGPT) and asked questions about nursing diagnoses, nursing interventions and nursing outcomes. We further synthesized these results. Results: In the process of educating nurses about the nursing process and nursing diagnosis, Generative Pretraining Transformer (ChatGPT) can present potential patient problems to nurses and guide them through the process from taking a medical history, setting nursing diagnoses and planning goals and interventions. Generative Pre -training Transformer (ChatGPT) returned appropriate nursing diagnoses, but these were not in line with the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association - International (NANDA-I) classification as requested. Of all the nursing diagnoses provided, only one was consistent with the most recent version of the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association - International (NANDA-I). Generative Pre -training Transformer (ChatGPT) is still not specific enough for nursing diagnoses, resulting in incorrect answers in several cases. Conclusions: Using Generative Pre -training Transformer (ChatGPT) to educate nurses and support the documentation process is time -efficient, but it still requires a certain level of human critical -thinking and factchecking.

AB Genetic algorithms (GAs) are routinely used to search problem spaces of interest. A lesser known but growing group of applications of GAs is the modeling of so-called "evolutionary processes", for example, organizational learning and group decision-making. Given such an application, we show it is possible to compute the likely GA parameter settings given observed populations of such an evolutionary process. We examine the parameter estimation process using estimation procedures for learning hidden Markov models, with mathematical models that exactly capture expected GA behavior. We then explore the sampling distributions relevant to this estimation problem using an experimental approach. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Introduction: Sepsis has complex, time-sensitive pathophysiology and important phenotypic subgroups. The objective of this study was to use machine learning analyses of blood and urine biomarker profiles to elucidate the pathophysiologic signatures of subgroups of surgical sepsis patients.
   Methods: This prospective cohort study included 243 surgical sepsis patients admitted to a quaternary care center between January 2015 and June 2017. We applied hierarchical clustering to clinical variables and 42 blood and urine biomarkers to identify phenotypic subgroups in a development cohort. Clinical characteristics and short-term and long-term outcomes were compared between clusters. A naive Bayes classifier predicted cluster labels in a validation cohort.
   Results: The development cohort contained one cluster characterized by early organ dysfunction (cluster I, n = 18) and one cluster characterized by recovery (cluster II, n = 139). Cluster I was associated with higher Acute Physiologic Assessment and Chronic Health Evaluation II (30 versus 16, P < 0.001) and SOFA scores (13 versus 5, P < 0.001), greater prevalence of chronic cardiovascular and renal disease (P < 0.001) and septic shock (78% versus 17%, P < 0.001). Cluster I had higher mortality within 14 d of sepsis onset (11% versus 1.5%, P = 0.001) and within 1 y (44% versus 20%, P = 0.032), and higher incidence of chronic critical illness (61% versus 30%, P = 0.001). The Bayes classifier achieved 95% accuracy and identified two clusters that were similar to development cohort clusters.
   Conclusions: Machine learning analyses of clinical and biomarker variables identified an early organ dysfunction sepsis phenotype characterized by inflammation, renal dysfunction, endotheliopathy, and immunosuppression, as well as poor short-term and long-term clinical outcomes.

AB Site visits or field trips have been a tool utilized by construction educators to engage students in active learning, assist traditional lessons, and attain stronger and deeper student learning experiences. Nevertheless, site visits present major logistical and accessibility challenges for educational institutions and instructors, reducing the number of students that have access to the benefits of such a technique. The limitations for site visits have further broadened recently, as the reality of the COVID-19 public health concerns has forced educators to move to online course delivery quickly and the majority of site visits have been canceled. The research goal of this paper is to present construction students with opportunities to enable online location-independent site visits where contextualized learning is dangerous, unsafe, or impossible to achieve. In this project, a virtual online learning environment was created to offer the affordances that provide an in-depth learning experience through collaborative communication for a plan-reading activity in a virtual space that resembles a real-world site visit to a building facility. This virtual online learning environment helped students to experience the physical and social aspects of the site visit while getting a collaborative opportunity to practice their plan-reading skills. A comparative study with a business-as-usual condition (online delivery through Zoom (R)) was conducted and the students' plan-reading performance and their feedback on the sense of presence, social presence, fatigue, and system usability was reported. The outcome of the study shows that such virtual collaborative site visits present unique opportunities to enable online delivery of spatiotemporal contexts of sites and offer an effective remote alternative when these learning opportunities are not available.

AB Clustering is one of the important topics in pattern recognition. Since only the structure of the data dictates the grouping (unsupervised learning), information theory is an obvious criteria to establish the clustering rule. This paper describes a novel valley seeking clustering algorithm using an information theoretic measure to estimate the cost of partitioning the data set The information theoretic criteria developed here evolved from a Renyi's entropy estimator that was proposed recently and has been successfully applied to other machine learning applications. An improved version of the k-change algorithm is used in optimization because of the stepwise nature of the cost function and existence of local minima. Even when applied to nonlinearly separable data, the new algorithm performs well, and was able to find nonlinear boundaries between clusters. The algorithm is also applied to the segmentation of magnetic resonance imaging data (MRI) with very promising results.

AB Objectives We conducted an implementation planning process during the pilot phase of a pragmatic trial, which tests an intervention guided by artificial intelligence (AI) analytics sourced from noninvasive monitoring data in heart failure patients (LINK-HF2).Materials and methods A mixed-method analysis was conducted at 2 pilot sites. Interviews were conducted with 12 of 27 enrolled patients and with 13 participating clinicians. iPARIHS constructs were used for interview construction to identify workflow, communication patterns, and clinician's beliefs. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using inductive coding protocols to identify key themes. Behavioral response data from the AI-generated notifications were collected.Results Clinicians responded to notifications within 24 hours in 95% of instances, with 26.7% resulting in clinical action. Four implementation themes emerged: (1) High anticipatory expectations for reliable patient communications, reduced patient burden, and less proactive provider monitoring. (2) The AI notifications required a differential and tailored balance of trust and action advice related to role. (3) Clinic experience with other home-based programs influenced utilization. (4) Responding to notifications involved significant effort, including electronic health record (EHR) review, patient contact, and consultation with other clinicians.Discussion Clinician's use of AI data is a function of beliefs regarding the trustworthiness and usefulness of the data, the degree of autonomy in professional roles, and the cognitive effort involved.Conclusion The implementation planning analysis guided development of strategies that addressed communication technology, patient education, and EHR integration to reduce clinician and patient burden in the subsequent main randomized phase of the trial. Our results provide important insights into the unique implications of implementing AI analytics into clinical workflow.

AB Sugarcane is the main industrial crop for sugar production, and its growth status is closely related to fertilizer, water, and light input. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based multispectral imagery is widely used for high-throughput phenotyping, since it can rapidly predict crop vigor at field scale. This study focused on the potential of drone multispectral images in predicting canopy nitrogen concentration (CNC) and irrigation levels for sugarcane. An experiment was carried out in a sugarcane field with three irrigation levels and five fertilizer levels. Multispectral images at an altitude of 40 m were acquired during the elongating stage. Partial least square (PLS), backpropagation neural network (BPNN), and extreme learning machine (ELM) were adopted to establish CNC prediction models based on various combinations of band reflectance and vegetation indices. The simple ratio pigment index (SRPI), normalized pigment chlorophyll index (NPCI), and normalized green-blue difference index (NGBDI) were selected as model inputs due to their higher grey relational degree with the CNC and lower correlation between one another. The PLS model based on the five-band reflectance and the three vegetation indices achieved the best accuracy (R-v = 0.79, RMSEv = 0.11). Support vector machine (SVM) and BPNN were then used to classify the irrigation levels based on five spectral features which had high correlations with irrigation levels. SVM reached a higher accuracy of 80.6%. The results of this study demonstrated that high resolution multispectral images could provide effective information for CNC prediction and water irrigation level recognition for sugarcane crop.

AB Models that are constructed within the bounds of a single paradigm are not sufficient for modeling all aspects of complex systems.  Therefore, even though reasoning and simulation systems that utilize a single modeling paradigm are the current norm, we explore a multimodel approach in this paper.  A multimodel approach is defined as one in which more than one model - each derived from a different perspective, and utilizing correspondingly distinct reasoning and simulation strategies - are employed.  By describing four models which illustrate the use of different modeling techniques, we show how a multimodel approach can enrich the modeling environment and make it correspond better with real world information.  Our models come from many sources - Systems and Simulation literature for the modeling of natural phenomena and artificial devices, and Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science for the modeling of human intuition and expertise in reasoning.  Generalizing from these four models, we suggest that modeling complex systems may best be approached from an integrated architectural viewpoint which combines multiple modeling paradigms.

ID TRACKING
AB Observation of 2D cell migration is integral to understanding fundamental biological phenomena and disease progression. However, migratory dynamic analysis is often reliant on computational tools that vary in accessibility and data resolution. Therefore, we aim to improve the throughput and accessibility of analysis by considering alternative 2D migration assays in combination with a machine learning-based segmentation model and computational ImageJ tracking plugin to track cell-specific migratory dynamics. Altering the barrier materials and shapes of cell exclusion zone assays, we found that room-temperature-vulcanizing silicone rubber detached unpredictably, and circular barriers covered less than 87% of the true punch area. A pilot test indicated no significant difference in directed migration, directed migration ratio, mean instantaneous speed, and track displacement between a traditional scratch and polydimethylsiloxane wounding, signifying comparable migratory dynamics. We demonstrate a method capable of identifying, tracking, and analyzing 2D migration dynamics, which enhances access to high-resolution data and computational tools.

AB The Clock Drawing Test-a simple pencil and paper test-has been used for more than 50 years as a screening tool to differentiate normal individuals from those with cognitive impairment, and has proven useful in helping to diagnose cognitive dysfunction associated with neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other dementias and conditions. We have been administering the test using a digitizing ballpoint pen that reports its position with considerable spatial and temporal precision, making available far more detailed data about the subject's performance. Using pen stroke data from these drawings categorized by our software, we designed and computed a large collection of features, then explored the tradeoffs in performance and interpretability in classifiers built using a number of different subsets of these features and a variety of different machine learning techniques. We used traditional machine learning methods to build prediction models that achieve high accuracy. We operationalized widely used manual scoring systems so that we could use them as benchmarks for our models. We worked with clinicians to define guidelines for model interpretability, and constructed sparse linear models and rule lists designed to be as easy to use as scoring systems currently used by clinicians, but more accurate. While our models will require additional testing for validation, they offer the possibility of substantial improvement in detecting cognitive impairment earlier than currently possible, a development with considerable potential impact in practice.

AB Background: In late 2022, an AI (artificial intelligence) application, ChatGPT (generative pre-trained transformer), was released free for public use. Although present use of AI applications are scant in nursing education, the easy access to ChatGPT will inevitably influence educational experiences for both educators and students. Nursing educators have an opportunity to leverage this new technology by understanding the functionality and limitations of ChatGPT. Method: This article examines the framework and functionality of ChatGPT and considers a potential nursing education assignment using the AI powered ChatGPT. The AI application, ChatGPT, is reviewed within the context of health care and nursing education and a potential nursing assignment leveraging ChatGPT is considered. Results: Nursing educators will increase their knowledge about ChatGPT and consider a possible nursing curriculum assignment using ChatGPT. Conclusion: Although not without limitations, nursing educators can leverage this new AI powered technology for an enhanced student experience. [ J Nurs Educ. . 2024;63(8):564-567.]

   learning; low count; spatio-temporal correlation
AB Objective. Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, which can provide information on dynamic changes in physiological metabolism, is now widely used in clinical diagnosis and cancer treatment. However, the reconstruction from dynamic data is extremely challenging due to the limited counts received in individual frame, especially in ultra short frames. Recently, the unrolled model-based deep learning methods have shown inspiring results for low-count PET image reconstruction with good interpretability. Nevertheless, the existing model-based deep learning methods mainly focus on the spatial correlations while ignore the temporal domain. Approach. In this paper, inspired by the learned primal dual (LPD) algorithm, we propose the spatio-temporal primal dual network (STPDnet) for dynamic low-count PET image reconstruction. Both spatial and temporal correlations are encoded by 3D convolution operators. The physical projection of PET is embedded in the iterative learning process of the network, which provides the physical constraints and enhances interpretability. Main results. The experiments of both simulation data and real rat scan data have shown that the proposed method can achieve substantial noise reduction in both temporal and spatial domains and outperform the maximum likelihood expectation maximization, spatio-temporal kernel method, LPD and FBPnet. Significance. Experimental results show STPDnet better reconstruction performance in the low count situation, which makes the proposed method particularly suitable in whole-body dynamic imaging and parametric PET imaging that require extreme short frames and usually suffer from high level of noise.

AB The benefits of incorporating process information in a large-scale assessment with the complex micro-level evidence from the examinees (i.e., process log data) are well documented in the research across large-scale assessments and learning analytics. This study introduces a deep-learning-based approach to predictive modeling of the examinee's performance in sequential, interactive problem-solving tasks from a large-scale assessment of adults' educational competencies. The current methods disambiguate problem-solving behaviors using network analysis to inform the examinee's performance in a series of problem-solving tasks. The unique contribution of this framework lies in the introduction of an "effort-aware" system. The system considers the information regarding the examinee's task-engagement level to accurately predict their task performance. The study demonstrates the potential to introduce a high-performing deep learning model to learning analytics and examinee performance modeling in a large-scale problem-solving task environment collected from the OECD Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC 2012) test in multiple countries, including the United States, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. Our findings indicated a close relationship between the examinee's engagement level and their problem-solving skills as well as the importance of modeling them together to have a better measure of students' problem-solving performance.

AB Premise: Among the slowest steps in the digitization of natural history collections is converting imaged labels into digital text. We present here a working solution to overcome this long-recognized efficiency bottleneck that leverages synergies between community science efforts and machine learning approaches.Methods: We present two new semi-automated services. The first detects and classifies typewritten, handwritten, or mixed labels from herbarium sheets. The second uses a workflow tuned for specimen labels to label text using optical character recognition (OCR). The label finder and classifier was built via humans-in-the-loop processes that utilize the community science Notes from Nature platform to develop training and validation data sets to feed into a machine learning pipeline.Results: Our results showcase a >93% success rate for finding and classifying main labels. The OCR pipeline optimizes pre-processing, multiple OCR engines, and post-processing steps, including an alignment approach borrowed from molecular systematics. This pipeline yields >4-fold reductions in errors compared to off-the-shelf open-source solutions. The OCR workflow also allows human validation using a custom Notes from Nature tool.Discussion: Our work showcases a usable set of tools for herbarium digitization including a custom-built web application that is freely accessible. Further work to better integrate these services into existing toolkits can support broad community use.

AB Perception of sensory signals is strongly influenced by their context, both in space and time. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical model, called convolutional dynamic networks, that effectively utilizes this contextual information, while inferring the representations of the visual inputs. We build this model based on a predictive coding framework and use the idea of empirical priors to incorporate recurrent and top-down connections. These connections endow the model with contextual information coming from temporal as well as abstract knowledge from higher layers. To perform inference efficiently in this hierarchical model, we rely on a novel scheme based on a smoothing proximal gradient method. When trained on unlabeled video sequences, the model learns a hierarchy of stable attractors, representing low-level to high-level parts of the objects. We demonstrate that the model effectively utilizes contextual information to produce robust and stable representations for object recognition in video sequences, even in case of highly corrupted inputs.

AB This paper assesses the media industry in the US by analyzing Big Tech's entrance into film and television production and the rise of streaming distribution technology. Through a case study of Prime Video, Amazon's prize streaming platform, this study explores how streaming technology has disrupted film and television from multiple perspectives, subjecting the industry to new logics of internet distribution, rooted in platforms, artificial intelligence, digital delivery systems, and big data. In the Big Tech worldview, disruption is an inherently progressive development. However, an analysis of Prime Video reveals how disruption is only the latest manifestation of conglomeration and convergence in the film and television industries. By uncovering the industry logics that govern the era of streaming, this paper analyzes the streaming industry of the present while taking into consideration the cable period in the past to account for the rapid technological development in the future.

AB Understanding the relationship between concrete temperature development and field curing time helps to control material quality, improve construction efficiency, and enhance research on concrete design. However, it is difficult to precisely predict temperature trends when placing concrete because there are many influencing factors and uncontrollable ambient variables in the curing process. To forecast the short-term temperature trends reliably and automatically, this research proposes a temperature measurement and quality prediction (TMQP) system to proactively evaluate the development trajectory of concrete quality and the temperature changes at the center and surface of the cross section of concrete structural members. The TMQP system includes radio-frequency identification (RFID) temperature sensors for recording the temperature data and Big Data analytics (BDA) combined with the machine-learning method of classification and regression tree (CART) for measuring and predicting of temperature development. The results indicate that the system has over 98% reliability on the correlation coefficients between the predicted temperatures and actual temperatures based on 240 h of continuous experiments and 190 h of documented data. This entire research design is applicable to various concrete construction projects and sheds light on how BDA and machine learning can help construction engineers and managers to control concrete curing and take preventive measures to avoid concrete surface cracks.

AB Both blemish and physical attributes were acquired on commercially graded Florida grapefruit, orange, and tangerine varieties. Using equal numbers of acceptable and rejected fruit, various neural network classification strategies were applied to blemish-related features and blemish plus physical features. The blemish plus physical feature neural net models were the most successful, yielding overall correct classification levels of 98.5% for grapefruit and orange and 98.3% for tangerine. No significant difference was found between the neural net models of standard back propagation, jump step, or variable transfer functions for the hidden layer.

AB Differences in medical outcomes may result from disease severity, treatment effectiveness, or chance. Because most outcome studies are observational rather than randomized, risk adjustment is necessary to account for case mix. This has usually been accomplished through the use of standard logistic regression models, although Bayesian models, hierarchical linear models, and machine-learning techniques such as neural networks have also been used. Many factors are essential to insuring the accuracy and usefulness of such models, including selection of an appropriate clinical database, inclusion of critical core variables, precise definitions for predictor variables and endpoints, proper model development, validation, and audit. Risk models may be used to assess the impact of specific predictors on outcome, to aid in patient counseling and treatment selection, to profile provider quality, and to serve as the basis of continuous quality improvement activities.

AB The modelling and measurement of expertise is a relatively new research area in artificial intelligence and cognitive science. Many domains do not have a formal method for evaluating expertise. When formal methods exist, they are frequently inefficient. Using an extension to the IAM program, a pattern recognition and acquisition method for evaluating the level of expertise for the domain of chess is developed. Chess players, as well as experts in other domains, use cognitive chunks of perceptual patterns to gain a cognitive economy that enables them to evaluate complex domain situations faster and more accurately than novices. The IAM program acquires a representative collection of the perceptual patterns demonstrated by a domain expert and uses those patterns to analyse skill level. A longitudinal study of a developing player and a comparison of the developing player to an established expert demonstrates the utility of the developed method for evaluating expertise.

AB Variation in nuclear size and shape is an important criterion of malignancy for many tumor types; however, categorical estimates by pathologists have poor reproducibility. Measurements of nuclear characteristics can improve reproducibility, but current manual methods are time-consuming. The aim of this study was to explore the limitations of estimates and develop alternative morphometric solutions for canine cutaneous mast cell tumors (ccMCTs). We assessed the following nuclear evaluation methods for accuracy, reproducibility, and prognostic utility: (1) anisokaryosis estimates by 11 pathologists; (2) gold standard manual morphometry of at least 100 nuclei; (3) practicable manual morphometry with stratified sampling of 12 nuclei by 9 pathologists; and (4) automated morphometry using deep learning-based segmentation. The study included 96 ccMCTs with available outcome information. Inter-rater reproducibility of anisokaryosis estimates was low (k = 0.226), whereas it was good (intraclass correlation = 0.654) for practicable morphometry of the standard deviation (SD) of nuclear size. As compared with gold standard manual morphometry (area under the ROC curve [AUC] = 0.839, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.701-0.977), the prognostic value (tumor-specific survival) of SDs of nuclear area for practicable manual morphometry and automated morphometry were high with an AUC of 0.868 (95% CI = 0.737-0.991) and 0.943 (95% CI = 0.889-0.996), respectively. This study supports the use of manual morphometry with stratified sampling of 12 nuclei and algorithmic morphometry to overcome the poor reproducibility of estimates. Further studies are needed to validate our findings, determine inter-algorithmic reproducibility and algorithmic robustness, and explore tumor heterogeneity of nuclear features in entire tumor sections.

AB Accurate building energy prediction plays an important role in improving the energy efficiency of buildings. This paper proposes a homogeneous ensemble approach, i.e., use of Random Forest (RF), for hourly building energy prediction. The approach was adopted to predict the hourly electricity usage of two educational buildings in North Central Florida. The RF models trained with different parameter settings were compared to investigate the impact of parameter setting on the prediction performance of the model. The results indicated that RF was not very sensitive to the number of variables (mtry) and using empirical mtry is preferable because it saves time and is more accurate. RF was compared with regression tree (RT) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) to validate the superiority of RF in building energy prediction. The prediction performances of RF measured by performance index (PI) were 14-25% and 5-5.5% better than RT and SVR, respectively, indicating that RF was the best prediction model in the comparison.
   Moreover, an analysis based on the variable importance of RF was performed to identify the most influential features during different semesters. The results showed that the most influential features vary depending on the semester, indicating the existence of different operational conditions for the tested buildings. A further comparison between RF trained with yearly and monthly data indicated that the energy usage prediction for educational buildings could be improved by taking into consideration their energy behavior changes during different semesters.

   MOISTURE; IMPACTS; SCALE
AB The intensity of an atmospheric river (AR) is only one of the factors influencing the damage it will cause. We use random forest models fit to hazard, exposure, and vulnerability data at different spatial and temporal scales in California to predict the probability that a given AR event will cause flood damage, as measured by National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) claims. We first demonstrate the usefulness of data-driven models and interpretable machine learning to identify and describe drivers of AR flood damage. Hazard features, particularly measures of AR intensity such as total precipitation, increase the probability of damage with increasing values up to a threshold point, after which the probability of damage saturates. Although hazard is generally the most important risk dimension across all models, exposure and vulnerability contribute up to a third of the explanatory power. Exposure and variability features generally increase the probability of damage with increasing values, apart from a few instances which can be explained by physical intuition, but tend to affect the probability of damage less for the largest AR events. Comparisons between random forest models at different spatial and temporal scales showed general agreement. We then examine limitations inherent in publicly available exposure, vulnerability, and loss data, focusing on the difference in temporal resolution between variables from different risk dimensions and discrepancies between NFIP claims and total flood losses, and describe how those limitations may affect the model results. Overall, the application of interpretable machine learning to understand the contributions of exposure and vulnerability to AR-driven flood risk has identified potential community risk drivers and strategies for resilience, but the results must be considered in the context of the data that produced them.

AB Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging infectious disease with increasing spread. Currently SFTS transmission has expanded beyond Asian countries, however, with definitive global extents and risk patterns remained obscure. Here we established an exhaustive database that included globally reported locations of human SFTS cases and the competent vector, Haemaphysalis longicornis (H. longicornis), as well as the explanatory environmental variables, based on which, the potential geographic range of H. longicornis and risk areas for SFTS were mapped by applying two machine learning methods. Ten predictors were identified contributing to global distribution for H. longicornis with relative contribution >= 1%. Outside contemporary known distribution, we predict high receptivity to H. longicornis across two continents, including northeastern USA, New Zealand, parts of Australia, and several Pacific islands. Eight key drivers of SFTS cases occurrence were identified, including elevation, predicted probability of H. longicornis presence, two temperature-related factors, two precipitation-related factors, the richness of mammals and percentage coverage of water bodies. The globally model-predicted risk map of human SFTS occurrence was created and validated effective for discriminating the actual affected and unaffected areas (median predictive probability 0.74 vs. 0.04, P < 0.001) in three countries with reported cases outside China. The high-risk areas (probability >= 50%) were predicted mainly in east-central China, most parts of the Korean peninsula and southern Japan, and northern New Zealand. Our findings highlight areas where an intensive vigilance for potential SFTS spread or invasion events should be advocated, owing to their high receptibility to H. longicornis distribution.

AB The establishment of an effective roadside air quality forecasting model provides important information for proper traffic management to mitigate severe pollution, and for alerting resident's outdoor plans to minimize exposure. Current deterministic models rely on numerical simulation and the tuning of parameters, and empirical models present powerful learning ability but have not fully considered the temporal periodicity of air pollutants. In order to take the periodicity of pollutants into empirical air quality forecasting models, this study evaluates the temporal variations of air pollutants and develops a novel sequence to sequence model with weekly periodicity to forecast air quality. Two-year observation data from Shanghai roadside air quality monitoring stations are employed to support analyzing and modeling. The results conclude that the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations show obvious daily and weekly variations, and the temporal patterns are nearly consistent with the periodicity of traffic flow in Shanghai. Compared with PM2.5, the CO concentrations are more affected by traffic variation. The proposed model outperforms the baseline model in terms of accuracy, and presents a higher linear consistency in PM2.5 prediction and lower errors in CO prediction. This study could assist environmental researchers to further improve the technologies for urban air quality forecasting, and serve as tools for supporting policymakers to implement related traffic management and emission control policies.

AB The identity of dark matter has remained surprisingly elusive. While terrestrial experiments may be able to nail down a model, an alternative method is to identify dark matter based on astrophysical or cosmological signatures. A particularly sensitive approach is based on the unique signature of dark matter substructure in galaxy-galaxy strong lensing images. Machine-learning applications have been explored for extracting this signal. Because of the limited availability of high-quality strong lensing images, these approaches have exclusively relied on simulations. Due to the differences with the real instrumental data, machine-learning models trained on simulations are expected to lose accuracy when applied to real data. Here domain adaptation can serve as a crucial bridge between simulations and real data applications. In this work, we demonstrate the power of domain adaptation techniques applied to strong gravitational lensing data with dark matter substructure. We show with simulated data sets representative of Euclid and Hubble Space Telescope observations that domain adaptation can significantly mitigate the losses in the model performance when applied to new domains. Lastly, we find similar results utilizing domain adaptation for the problem of lens finding by adapting models trained on a simulated data set to one composed of real lensed and unlensed galaxies from the Hyper Suprime-Cam. This technique can help domain experts build and apply better machine-learning models for extracting useful information from the strong gravitational lensing data expected from the upcoming surveys.

AB Tabular knowledge-based systems are known to be extremely versatile for verification and validation of knowledge bases. However, a major disadvantage of these systems is the combinatorial explosion that accompanies addition of new attributes or condition entries in the table. One of the means of alleviating this problem in tabular knowledge-based systems is through modularization, which is the process of breaking a big comprehensive table into smaller tables that are easy to deal with. In this study, we propose and illustrate another means to deal with this problem through use of feature construction methodology. The proposed method can be used synergistically with modularization to alleviate problems associated with combinatorial explosion in tabular knowledge bases. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB Purpose Recycled waste glasses have been widely used in Portland cement and concrete as aggregate or supplementary cementitious material. Compressive strength is one of the most important properties of concrete containing waste glasses, providing information about the loading capacity, pozzolanic reaction and porosity of the mixture. This study aims to propose highly nonlinear models to predict the compressive strength of concrete containing finely ground glass particles.
   Design/methodology/approach A robust machine leaning method called genetic programming is used the build the compressive strength prediction models. The models are developed using a number of test results on 50-mm mortar cubes containing glass powder according to ASTM C109. Parametric and sensitivity analyses are conducted to evaluate the effect of the predictor variables on the compressive strength. Furthermore, a comparative study is performed to benchmark the proposed models against classical regression models.
   Findings The derived design equations accurately characterize the compressive strength of concrete with ground glass fillers and remarkably outperform the regression models. A key feature of the proposed models as compared to the previous studies is that they include the simultaneous effect of various parameters such as glass compositions, size distributions, curing age and isothermal temperatures. Parametric and sensitivity analyses indicate that compressive strength is very sensitive to the curing age, curing temperature and particle surface area.
   Originality/value This study presents accurate machine learning models for the prediction of one of the most important mechanical properties of cementitious mixtures modified by waste glass, i.e. compressive strength. In addition, it provides an insight into the effect of several parameters influencing the compressive strength. From a computing perspective, a robust machine learning technique that overcomes the shortcomings of existing soft computing methods is introduced.

AB Detection of flowering and quantification of flowering phenology are key to monitoring the reproduction of tropical trees and their response to global change. However, effective monitoring of flowering over various scales from individuals to forest ecosystem levels is lacking due to the relatively small sizes of flowers, diverse flowering strategies across species, and the short duration of flowering, making accurate flower detection difficult. Dronebased surveys require less time and human resources than traditional ground-based flower surveys and thus may be able to help address this in a cost-effective manner but remain underexplored in species-rich tropical forest ecosystems. Here, we developed a method that integrated the Residual Networks 50 (ResNet50) deep learning algorithm with high resolution imagery (c. 0.05 m) from monthly drone surveys done in a 50-ha tropical forest plot on Barro Colorado Island (BCI), Panam & PRIME;a, over 2018-2020 to detect a diversity of flowering species in this tree community and to track the timing of flowering throughout the year. We built a comprehensive training library of canopy components (flower, leaf, branch, and shade) from this forest plot throughout the study period, trained a single deep learning model across all drone imagery, and validated it using five-fold cross validation at the pixel scale. We further generated image- and tree-crown-specific supervised classifications to evaluate the deep learning model at the tree-crown scale. Our deep learning method accurately classified flowers (User's accuracy = 95.3 %, Producer's accuracy = 85.8 %) while maintaining high predictive power for the other three classes (Overall accuracy = 98.4 %). Our results also demonstrated high consistency against tree-crown-specific supervised classifications for flower (r2 = 0.85), leaf (r2 = 0.84), and branch (r2 = 0.92) components, with lower agreement observed for the shade component (r2 = 0.59). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in advancing fine-scale flower monitoring in the tropics, with potential to be extended to other regions or other remote sensing platforms with frequent high-resolution monitoring. The method will allow us to better monitor flowering in tropical forests and improve our understanding of how phenology and reproductive success may be affected by climate change.

AB HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders remain prevalent among persons living with HIV (PLWH) owing to our limited understanding of the contributing viral mechanisms and ability to predict disease onset. We have expanded on a machine learning method previously used on HIV genetic sequence data to predict neurocognitive impairment in PLWH to the more extensively sampled SIV-infected macaque model in order to (i) determine the translatability of the animal model and (ii) more accurately characterize the predictive capacity of the method.
   In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, virus replication in and adaptation to the central nervous system (CNS) can result in neurocognitive deficits in approximately 25% of patients with unsuppressed viremia. While no single viral mutation can be agreed upon as distinguishing the neuroadapted population, earlier studies have demonstrated that a machine learning (ML) approach could be applied to identify a collection of mutational signatures within the virus envelope glycoprotein (Gp120) predictive of disease. The S[imian]IV-infected macaque is a widely used animal model of HIV neuropathology, allowing in-depth tissue sampling infeasible for human patients. Yet, translational impact of the ML approach within the context of the macaque model has not been tested, much less the capacity for early prediction in other, noninvasive tissues. We applied the previously described ML approach to prediction of SIV-mediated encephalitis (SIVE) using gp120 sequences obtained from the CNS of animals with and without SIVE with 97% accuracy. The presence of SIVE signatures at earlier time points of infection in non-CNS tissues indicated these signatures cannot be used in a clinical setting; however, combined with protein structural mapping and statistical phylogenetic inference, results revealed common denominators associated with these signatures, including 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-d-glucopyranose structural interactions and high rate of alveolar macrophage (AM) infection. AMs were also determined to be the phyloanatomic source of cranial virus in SIVE animals, but not in animals that did not develop SIVE, implicating a role for these cells in the evolution of the signatures identified as predictive of both HIV and SIV neuropathology.IMPORTANCE HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders remain prevalent among persons living with HIV (PLWH) owing to our limited understanding of the contributing viral mechanisms and ability to predict disease onset. We have expanded on a machine learning method previously used on HIV genetic sequence data to predict neurocognitive impairment in PLWH to the more extensively sampled SIV-infected macaque model in order to (i) determine the translatability of the animal model and (ii) more accurately characterize the predictive capacity of the method. We identified eight amino acid and/or biochemical signatures in the SIV envelope glycoprotein, the most predominant of which demonstrated the potential for aminoglycan interaction characteristic of previously identified HIV signatures. These signatures were not isolated to specific points in time or to the central nervous system, limiting their use as an accurate clinical predictor of neuropathogenesis; however, statistical phylogenetic and signature pattern analyses implicate the lungs as a key player in the emergence of neuroadapted viruses.

AB Anatomical and physiological compartmentalization of neurons is a mechanism to increase the computational capacity of a circuit, and a major question is what role axonal compartmentalization plays. Axonal compartmentalization may enable localized, presynaptic plasticity to alter neuronal output in a flexible, experience-dependent manner. Here, we show that olfactory learning generates compartmentalized, bidirectional plasticity of acetylcholine release that varies across the longitudinal compartments of Drosophila mushroom body (MB) axons. The directionality of the learning-induced plasticity depends on the valence of the learning event (aversive vs. appetitive), varies linearly across proximal to distal compartments following appetitive conditioning, and correlates with learning-induced changes in downstream mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) that modulate behavioral action selection. Potentiation of acetylcholine release was dependent on the Ca(V)2.1 calcium channel subunit cacophony. In addition, contrast between the positive conditioned stimulus and other odors required the inositol triphosphate receptor, which maintained responsivity to odors upon repeated presentations, preventing adaptation. Downstream from the MB, a set of MBONs that receive their input from the gamma 3 MB compartment were required for normal appetitive learning, suggesting that they represent a key node through which reward learning influences decision-making. These data demonstrate that learning drives valence-correlated, compartmentalized, bidirectional potentiation, and depression of synaptic neurotransmitter release, which rely on distinct mechanisms and are distributed across axonal compartments in a learning circuit.

AB The United States NRCS has a soil database that has data collected from across the country over the last several decades. This also includes soil spectral scans. This data is available, but it may not be used to its full potential. For this study, pedon, horizon and spectral data was extracted from the database for samples collected from 2011 to 2015. Only sites that had been fully described and horizons that had been analyzed for the full suite of desired properties were used. This resulted in over 14,000 samples that were used for modeling and eight soil properties: soil organic carbon (SOC); total nitrogen (TN); total sulfur (TS); clay; sand; exchangeable calcium (Ca-ex); cation exchange capacity (CEC); and pH. Four chemometric methods were employed for soil property prediction: partial least squares (PLSR); Random Forest (RF); Cubist; and multivariable adaptive regression splines (MARS). The dataset was sufficiently large that only random subsetting was used to create calibration (70%) and validation (30%) sets. SOC, TN, and TS had the strongest prediction results, with an R-2 value of over 0.9. Ca-ex, CEC and pH were predicted moderately well. Clay and sand models had slightly lower performance. Of the four methods, Cubist produced the strongest models, while PLSR produced the weakest. This may be due to the complex relationships between soil properties and spectra that PLSR could not capture. The only drawback of Cubist is the difficult interpretability of variable importance. Future research should include the use of environmental variables to improve prediction results. Future work may also avoid the use of PLSR when dealing with large datasets that cover large areas and have high degrees of variability.

AB Feature construction has been shown to be an useful technique to improve the efficiency of extracting information from raw data. We develop a modified feature construction algorithm, using correlation information among the initial set of features, and study its performance. Feed-forward neural networks, using the back-propagation algorithm to learn, have been shown to have excellent properties while plagued with the problem of time needed to learn concepts. We alleviate this inherent problem with the back-propagation algorithm using data pre-processed by the proposed feature construction algorithm. Initial results suggest that this methodology can be beneficially used along with other means of improving the learning performance in feed-forward neural networks.

AB Morphological neural networks are based on a new paradigm for neural computing. Instead of adding the products of neural values and corresponding synaptic weights, the basic neural computation in a morphological neuron takes the maximum or minimum of the sums of neural values and their corresponding synaptic weights. By taking the maximum (or minimum) of sums instead of the sum of products, morphological neuron computation is nonlinear before thresholding. As a consequence, the properties of morphological neural networks are drastically different than those of traditional neural network models. In this paper we restrict our attention to morphological associative memories. After a brief review of morphological neural computing and a short discussion about the properties of morphological associative memories, we present new methodologies and associated theorems for retrieving complete stored patterns from noisy or incomplete patterns using morphological associative memories. These methodologies are derived from the notions of morphological independence, strong independence, minimal representations of patterns vectors, and kernels. Several examples are provided in order to illuminate these novel concepts.

AB The field of behavioral medicine has a long and successful history of leveraging digital health tools to promote health behavior change. Our 2019 summary of the history and future of digital health in behavioral medicine (Arigo in J Behav Med 8: 67-83, 2019) was one of the most highly cited articles in the Journal of Behavioral Medicine from 2010 to 2020; here, we provide an update on the opportunities and challenges we identified in 2019. We address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on behavioral medicine research and practice and highlight some of the digital health advances it prompted. We also describe emerging challenges and opportunities in the evolving ecosystem of digital health in the field of behavioral medicine, including the emergence of new evidence, research methods, and tools to promote health and health behaviors. Specifically, we offer updates on advanced research methods, the science of digital engagement, dissemination and implementation science, and artificial intelligence technologies, including examples of uses in healthcare and behavioral medicine. We also provide recommendations for next steps in these areas with attention to ethics, training, and accessibility considerations. The field of behavioral medicine has made meaningful advances since 2019 and continues to evolve with impressive pace and innovation.

AB Service robots as an example of service innovation has been of great interest to researchers as it could produce greater value-in-use for consumers during service encounters. However, the question of how and why service robots may affect consumers remains inadequately understood. Leveraging service-dominant logic and the heuristic-systematic model, Study 1 examines the impacts of service innovation types on brand equity and the moderating role of consumer expertise. Study 2 explores whether cognitive and emotional trust can bridge the underlying mechanism. We find that consumers with higher levels of service expertise rate firms with supportive innovation (vs. interactive innovation) higher in brand equity. On the other hand, service novices rate firms with both types of service innovation similarly. Emotional trust significantly mediates the effect mentioned above. In addition, consumers with high technology expertise will better recognize firms' service innovation efforts regardless of innovation type. Our findings extend the service innovation literature by demonstrating how individual-level factors such as consumer expertise help explain the relationships between various types of service robots and consumer response. Moreover, we reveal the importance for service brands to invest in different service robots based on target groups and build emotional trust with consumers.

AB Predictive modeling in online education is a popular topic in learning analytics research and practice. This study proposes a novel predictive modeling method to improve model transferability over time within the same course and across different courses. The research gaps addressed are limited evidence showing whether a predictive model built on historical data retrospectively can be directly applied to a future offering of the same course or to another different course; lacking interpretable data mining models to improve model transferability over time and across courses. Three datasets from two distinct online courses with one course offered two times over two years were applied using direct transferring of the predictive model and the proposed Bayesian updating technique for model transfer. The results showed that the direct transferring of predictive model to the subsequent offering of the course and to a totally different course did not work effectively. By contrast, the proposed Bayesian updating provided a robust and interpretable approach with improved model transferability results for both situations. This Bayesian updating model can be continuously updated with new collected data rather than building prediction model from scratch every time, which can serve as a new methodological framework to carry experience and knowledge from past and other courses forward to new courses.

AB We study the formation, evolution, and collapse of dense cores by tracking structures in a magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a star-forming cloud. We identify cores using the dendrogram algorithm and utilize machine learning techniques, including Neural Gas prototype learning and Fuzzy c-means clustering to analyse the density and velocity dispersion profiles of cores together with six bulk properties. We produce a 2-d visualization using a Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), which facilitates the connection between physical properties and three partially-overlapping phases: i) unbound turbulent structures (Phase I), ii) coherent cores that have low turbulence (Phase II), and iii) bound cores, many of which become protostellar (Phase III). Within Phase II, we identify a population of long-lived coherent cores that reach a quasi-equilibrium state. Most prestellar cores form in Phase II and become protostellar after evolving into Phase III. Due to the turbulent cloud environment, the initial core properties do not uniquely predict the eventual evolution, i.e. core evolution is stochastic, and cores follow no one evolutionary path. The phase lifetimes are 1.0 +/- 0.1 x 10(5) yr, 1.3 +/- 0.2 x 10(5) yr, and 1.8 +/- 0.3 x 10(5) yr for Phase I, II, and III, respectively. We compare our results to NH3 observations of dense cores. Known coherent cores predominantly map into Phase II, while most turbulent pressure-confined cores map to Phase I or III. We predict that a significant fraction of observed starless cores have unresolved coherent regions and that greater than or similar to 20 per cent of observed starless cores will not form stars. Measurements of core radial profiles in addition to the usual bulk properties will enable more accurate predictions of core evolution.

AB Modern plant breeding programs collect several data types such as weather, images, and secondary or associated traits besides the main trait (e.g., grain yield). Genomic data is high-dimensional and often over-crowds smaller data types when naively combined to explain the response variable. There is a need to develop methods able to effectively combine different data types of differing sizes to improve predictions. Additionally, in the face of changing climate conditions, there is a need to develop methods able to effectively combine weather information with genotype data to predict the performance of lines better. In this work, we develop a novel three-stage classifier to predict multi-class traits by combining three data types-genomic, weather, and secondary trait. The method addressed various challenges in this problem, such as confounding, differing sizes of data types, and threshold optimization. The method was examined in different settings, including binary and multi-class responses, various penalization schemes, and class balances. Then, our method was compared to standard machine learning methods such as random forests and support vector machines using various classification accuracy metrics and using model size to evaluate the sparsity of the model. The results showed that our method performed similarly to or better than machine learning methods across various settings. More importantly, the classifiers obtained were highly sparse, allowing for a straightforward interpretation of relationships between the response and the selected predictors.

AB Background: Despite the recent success of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in identifying 90 independent risk loci for Parkinson's disease (PD), the genomic underpinning of PD is still largely unknown. At the same time, accurate and reliable predictive models utilizing genomic or demographic features are desired in the clinic for predicting the risk of Parkinson's disease.
   Methods: To identify influential demographic and genomic factors associated with PD and to further develop predictive models, we utilized demographic data, incorporating 200 variables across 33,473 participants, along with genomic data involving 447,089 SNPs across 8,840 samples, both derived from the Fox Insight online study. We first applied correlation and GWAS analyses to find the top demographic and genomic factors associated with PD, respectively. We further developed and compared a variety of machine learning (ML) models for predicting PD. From the developed ML models, we performed feature importance analysis to reveal the predictability of each demographic or the genomic input feature for PD. Finally, we performed gene set enrichment analysis on our GWAS results to identify PD-associated pathways.
   Results: In our study, we identified both novel and well-known demographic and genetic factors (along with the enriched pathways) related to PD. In addition, we developed predictive models that performed robustly, with AUC = 0.89 for demographic data and AUC = 0.74 for genomic data. Our GWAS analysis identified several novel and significant variants and gene loci, including three intron variants in LMNA (p-values smaller than 4.0e-21) and one missense variant in SEMA4A (p-value = 1.11e-26). Our feature importance analysis from the PD-predictive ML models highlighted some significant and novel variants from our GWAS analysis (e.g., the intron variant rs1749409 in the RIT1 gene) and helped identify potentially causative variants that were missed by GWAS, such as rs11264300, a missense variant in the gene DCST1, and rs11584630, an intron variant in the gene KCNN3.
   Conclusion: In summary, by combining a GWAS with advanced machine learning models, we identified both known and novel demographic and genomic factors as well as built well-performing ML models for predicting Parkinson's disease.

AB In this study we describe a methodology to exploit a specific type of domain knowledge in order to find tighter error bounds on the performance of classification via Support Vector Machines. The domain knowledge we consider is that the input space lies inside of a specified convex polytope. First, we consider prior knowledge about the domain by incorporating upper and lower bounds of attributes. We then consider a more general framework that allows us to encode prior knowledge in the form of linear constraints formed by attributes. By using the ellipsoid method from optimization literature, we show that, this can be exploited to upper bound the radius of the hyper-sphere that contains the input space, and enables us to tighten generalization error bounds. We provide a comparative numerical analysis and show the effectiveness of our approach. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Parametric optimization is a critical component in designing and prototyping combustion systems. How-ever, existing parametric optimization methods often suffer from either insufficient prediction accuracy or computationally prohibitive data generation costs. This study develops and validates an efficient and robust field-resolving surrogate modeling framework for combustion systems based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). This study comprises three progressive steps. (1) We propose a PINNs frame-work for premixed combustion and validate its accuracy with direct numerical simulation (DNS) for one-dimensional and two-dimensional canonical premixed combustion problems. Results show a robust pre-dictive capability of PINNs with R 2 generally above 0.99. (2) We continue to develop a field-resolving surrogate modeling framework for parameterized two-dimensional methane-air jet combustion system with five input parameters: inlet equivalence ratio, temperature, velocity, diameter, and coflow tempera-ture. The PINNS surrogate model after unsupervised training is used to predict the combustion fields for 32 input parameter combinations, and the results are compared against corresponding numerical sim-ulations. The surrogate model accurately predicts the temperature fields with R 2 over 0.95, except in case of flashback, where the accuracy is slightly lower. Good consistency between PINNs and numeri-cal simulations is also demonstrated for four combustion performance metrics: flame length, maximum temperature, outlet temperature, and outlet CO2 mass fraction. (3) Based on the validated field-resolving PINNs surrogate model, sensitivity analysis of the parameterized combustion system is performed, and its implications for engineering applications are discussed. Most notably, distinct from common data-driven and machine learning approaches, the proposed PINNs models are entirely physics-driven and do not use any training datasets, saving tremendous amount of time in the design of experiments (DOE) and case -by-case simulations. Overall, the results of this study demonstrate PINNs can be an efficient and robust surrogate modeling approach for parameterized combustion system visualization, design, optimization, and active control.(c) 2023 The Combustion Institute.

AB The socio-economic effects of urban elevated roads have been well-documented in previous studies. Nevertheless, the environmental impacts of the elevated road location are rarely considered. In this study, we quantified such impacts on four traffic pollutants (e.g., NO, NO2, CO, and O-3) in Shanghai, using the two-year observation data from Shanghai roadside air quality monitoring stations-under the elevated road and on the side of the elevated mad. Auto-correlation analysis was employed to identify the periodic patterns of air pollutants. The results showed that the severer traffic pollution and more notable daily periodic characteristics of air pollutants were observed under the elevated road. This result may be attributed to the elevated "cap" structure, which has become a barrier to prevent the pollutant diffusion in street canyon. Further, a novel Long Short-Term Memory model with the identified periodicity was proposed to predict air quality. The proposed model achieved higher goodness of fit and lower prediction error in prediction of four pollutants compared to other baseline models, and that the forecasting accuracy was higher under the elevated road. These findings ascertain the effect of the elevated road location on the variations of atmospheric pollutants and could provide implications in taking control measures to mitigate traffic pollution under the elevated road.

AB This paper proposes a novel architecture, termed multiscale principle of relevant information (MPRI), to learn discriminative spectral-spatial features for hyperspectral image classification. MPRI inherits the merits of the principle of relevant information (PRI) to effectively extract multiscale information embedded in the given data, and also takes advantage of the multilayer structure to learn representations in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, MPRI performs spectral-spatial pixel characterization (using PRI) and feature dimensionality reduction (using regularized linear discriminant analysis) iteratively and successively. Extensive experiments on three benchmark data sets demonstrate that MPRI outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods (including deep learning based ones) qualitatively and quantitatively, especially in the scenario of limited training samples. Code of MPRI is available at http://bit.ly/MPRI_HSI.

ID IMPUTATION
AB Assessing building damage in coastal communities after a hurricane event is crucial for reducing both immediate and long-term disaster impacts, as well as for enhancing resilience planning and disaster preparedness. Despite the extensive data collection efforts of the post-hurricane reconnaissance teams, some information on the structural features of damaged buildings is often missing due to various reasons, like the absence of relevant documents or severe building damage, thereby limiting our comprehensive understanding of building resilience to natural disasters. This study introduces a machine learning approach based on extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) to reconstruct missing structural features of the damaged buildings from four types of data (known structural, geospatial, hazard, and damage level information). XGBoost models were trained based on the reconnaissance datasets collected from four regions affected by Hurricanes. For each region, we analyzed the model's performance depending on the missing structural features. We also demonstrated the importance of including geospatial, hazard, and damage level data by showing improved performance of XGBoost models compared to those trained only on known structural data. Furthermore, we examined how the accuracy of the XGBoost approach changes if multiple structural features are missing. This XGBoost approach has the potential to support post-hurricane building damage assessments by providing missing building details, enabling comprehensive post-disaster analysis.

ID GENOMIC ANALYSES
AB OBJECTIVE To compare pedigree documentation and genetic test results to evaluate whether user-provided photographs influ-- ence the breed ancestry predictions of direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic tests for dogs. ANIMALS 12 registered purebred pet dogs representing 12 different breeds. METHODS Each dog owner submitted 6 buccal swabs, 1 to each of 6 DTC genetic testing companies. Experimenters registered each sample per manufacturer instructions. For half of the dogs, the registration included a photograph of the DNA donor. For the other half of the dogs, photographs were swapped between dogs. DNA analysis and breed ancestry prediction were conducted by each company. The effect of condition (ie, matching vs shuffled photograph) was evaluated for each company's breed predictions. As a positive control, a convolutional neural network was also used to predict breed based solely on the photograph. RESULTS Results from 5 of the 6 tests always included the dog's registered breed. One test and the convolutional neural network were unlikely to identify the registered breed and frequently returned results that were more similar to the photograph than the DNA. Additionally, differences in the predictions made across all tests underscored the chal-- lenge of identifying breed ancestry, even in purebred dogs. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Veterinarians are likely to encounter patients who have conducted DTC genetic testing and may be asked to explain the results of genetic tests they did not order. This systematic comparison of commercially available tests provides context for interpreting results from consumer-grade DTC genetic testing kits.

ID NETWORKS
AB To avoid local minimum solutions in back propagation learning, we propose to treat feedforward neural network training as a global optimization problem. In particular, we considered using branch-and-bound based Lipschitz optimization methods in neural network training, and developed globally optimal training algorithms (GOTA). The standard criterion function of a feedforward neural network is Lipschitzian. The effectiveness of GOTA is improved by using dynamically computed local Lipschitz constants over subsets of the weight space. Local search procedures, such as the classic back propagation algorithm, can be incorporated in GOTA. The local search-augmented global algorithms improve the learning efficiency of GOTA while retaining the globally convergent property.

AB Huanglongbing (HLB) is one of the most destructive citrus diseases, mainly caused by the Gram-negative bacteria Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus. Aiming at unraveling the mechanisms of different scion/rootstock combinations on improving HLB-affected orange juice quality, the effects of rootstocks on the metabolites of HLB-affected sweet orange juices were investigated using a combined strategy of untargeted metabolomics and machine learning. A total of 2531 ion features were detected using UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, and 54 metabolites including amino acids, amines, flavonoids, coumarins, fatty acids, and glycosides were definitely or tentatively identified as the differential markers based on the random forest algorithm. Furthermore, 24 metabolites were verified and semi-quantified using authentic standards. Notably, the presence of specific amino acids and amines, especially polyamines, indicated that different rootstocks might affect glutamate, aspartate, proline, and arginine metabolism to regulate the physiological response against HLB. Meanwhile, the production of flavonoids and prenylated coumarins suggested that rootstocks influenced phenylalanine and phenylpropanoid metabolism. The possible metabolic pathways were proposed, and the important intermediates were verified by authentic standards.

AB Understanding the halo-galaxy connection is fundamental in order to improve our knowledge on the nature and properties of dark matter. In this work, we build a model that infers the mass of a halo given the positions, velocities, stellar masses, and radii of the galaxies it hosts. In order to capture information from correlations among galaxy properties and their phase space, we use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are designed to work with irregular and sparse data. We train our models on galaxies from more than 2000 state-of-the-art simulations from the Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations project. Our model, which accounts for cosmological and astrophysical uncertainties, is able to constrain the masses of the halos with a similar to 0.2 dex accuracy. Furthermore, a GNN trained on a suite of simulations is able to preserve part of its accuracy when tested on simulations run with a different code that utilizes a distinct subgrid physics model, showing the robustness of our method. The PyTorch Geometric implementation of the GNN is publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/PabloVD/HaloGraphNet).

AB BackgroundAttention to the collection of patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) associated with total hip arthroplasty (THA) is growing. The aim of this study was to preoperatively predict failure to achieve the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) and substantial clinical benefit (SCB) between pre- and postoperative PROMs. In addition, we sought to identify factors predictive of failure to achieve MCID and SCB in patients undergoing a THA.MethodsA retrospective query of the electronic health record data was performed at a single institution. Outcomes of interest were the anchor-based MCID, the distribution-based MCID, and the SCB for the Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement. Several machine learning models were built for each outcome and were evaluated by areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the precision-recall curve. Furthermore, logistic regression models were used to identify significant risk factors.ResultsOf the 857 patients who underwent THA, 350 patients completed both pre- and postoperative surveys. Of the final sample (i.e., 350 patients), 56 (16.0%), 29 (8.3%), and 71 (20.3%) failed to reach the anchor-based (i.e., 17.7 points) and distribution-based (10.6 points) MCIDs and the SCB (i.e., 22.0 points). The machine learning model performances were far beyond the baseline and comparable to the ones in existing studies, suggesting reliability in the prediction. Two shared factors associated with the failure in both the MCIDs and the SCB were highlighted: a patient's race and pre-existing mental illness.ConclusionUnderstanding the risk factors of failing to meet MCID and SCB may provide a more objective opportunity to quantify patient and surgeon expectations associated with THA. Our findings call stakeholders' particular attention to patients with preoperative mental disorders, and raise further questions regarding the impact of race, in the care of patients with degenerative hip disease.

AB Broadly speaking, building energy use prediction can be classified into two categories based on modeling approaches namely engineering and Artificial Intelligence (AI). While engineering approach requires solving physical equations representing the thermal performance of systems and components that constitute the buildings, the AI-based approach uses historical data to predict future performance. Although engineering approach estimates energy use with greater accuracy, it falls short in the overall complexity of model building and simulation in which detailed data that represent the building geometry, systems, configurations, and occupant schedule is needed. Whereas, the AI-based approach offers a rapid prediction of building energy use and, if appropriately trained and tested, may be used for quick and efficient decision making of energy use reduction. Nevertheless, for robust integration with and to improve automated building systems management and intelligence, the need for consistent, stable, and higher prediction accuracy cannot be understated. To alleviate the instability issue, and to improve prediction accuracy, we have exploited and tested an ensemble learning technique, 'Ensemble Bagging Trees' (EBT), using data obtained from meteorological systems and building-level occupancy and meters Results showed that the proposed EBT model predicted hourly electricity demand of the test building with improved accuracy of Mean Absolute Prediction Error that ranged from 2.97% to 4.63%. Additionally, results showed that proposed variable selection method could reduce the computation time of EBT by 38-41% without sacrificing the prediction accuracy. The proposed ensemble learning model that exemplifies improved prediction accuracy over other AI techniques can be used for real-time applications such as system fault detection and diagnosis.

AB Immunocyte infiltration and cytotoxicity play critical roles in both inflammation and immunotherapy. However, current cancer immunotherapy screening methods overlook the capacity of the T cells to penetrate the tumor stroma, thereby significantly limiting the development of effective treatments for solid tumors. Here, we present an automated high-throughput microfluidic platform for simultaneous tracking of the dynamics of T cell infiltration and cytotoxicity within the 3D tumor cultures with a tunable stromal makeup. By recourse to a clinical tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) score analyzer, which is based on a clinical data-driven deep learning method, our platform can evaluate the efficacy of each treatment based on the scoring of T cell infiltration patterns. By screening a drug library using this technology, we identified an epigenetic drug (lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 inhibitor, LSD1i) that effectively promoted T cell tumor infiltration and enhanced treatment efficacy in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD1) in vivo. We demonstrated an automated system and strategy for screening immunocyte-solid tumor interactions, enabling the discovery of immuno- and combination therapies.

AB Standard of care diagnostic procedure for suspected skin cancer is microscopic examination of hematoxylin & eosin stained tissue by a pathologist. Areas of high inter-pathologist discordance and rising biopsy rates necessitate higher efficiency and diagnostic reproducibility. We present and validate a deep learning system which classifies digitized dermatopathology slides into 4 categories. The system is developed using 5,070 images from a single lab, and tested on an uncurated set of 13,537 images from 3 test labs, using whole slide scanners manufactured by 3 different vendors. The system's use of deep-learning-based confidence scoring as a criterion to consider the result as accurate yields an accuracy of up to 98%, and makes it adoptable in a real-world setting. Without confidence scoring, the system achieved an accuracy of 78%. We anticipate that our deep learning system will serve as a foundation enabling faster diagnosis of skin cancer, identification of cases for specialist review, and targeted diagnostic classifications.

TI Experimental evidence that rill-bed morphology is governed by emergent

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

DT Article
ID TIME-SERIES; STEPS; FLOW
AB Past experimental work found that rill erosion occurs mainly during rill formation in response to feedback between rill-flow hydraulics and rill-bed roughness, and that this feedback mechanism shapes rill beds into a succession of step-pool units that self-regulates sediment transport capacity of established rills. The search for clear regularities in the spatial distribution of step-pool units has been stymied by experimental rill-bed profiles exhibiting irregular fluctuating patterns of qualitative behavior. We hypothesized that the succession of step-pool units is governed by nonlinear-deterministic dynamics, which would explain observed irregular fluctuations. We tested this hypothesis with nonlinear time series analysis to reverse-engineer (reconstruct) state-space dynamics from fifteen experimental rill-bed profiles analyzed in previous work. Our results support this hypothesis for rill-bed profiles generated both in a controlled lab (flume) setting and in an in-situ hillside setting. The results provide experimental evidence that rill morphology is shaped endogenously by internal nonlinear hydrologic and soil processes rather than stochastically forced; and set a benchmark guiding specification and testing of new theoretical framings of rill-bed roughness in soil-erosion modeling. Finally, we applied echo state neural network machine learning to simulate reconstructed rill-bed dynamics so that morphological development could be forecasted out-of-sample.

AB Remote sensing technologies and predictive models have seen significant advancements, yet issues related to data quality, consistency, and accuracy persist. While many studies emphasize model accuracy, the precision and consistency of these technologies are often overlooked. This study addresses that gap by conducting a comprehensive evaluation of Agroview, a cloud-based AI-driven application, assessing its performance in analyzing plant-level data, such as inventory, canopy height, area, and leaf density, across two citrus blocks over four distinct data collection dates. Agroview demonstrated consistent reliability, with low coefficients of variation (CV) across key metrics. For example, tree inventory showed variations of <3 %, with CVs of 2.63 % for Block A and 1.56 % for Block B. Canopy height measurements exhibited CVs below 9 % for most trees, with a slightly higher CV of 12 % for trees over 12 ft in Block B. This analysis highlights the software's precision and identifies areas for potential refinement. The findings of this study highlight the importance of precision in remote sensing, providing valuable insights for users and stakeholders while promoting confidence in the broader adoption of advanced technologies in agriculture.

AB The Arab-Israeli conflict, which at first had a zero-sum, protracted nature, has changed over tinic because of effective conflict management that has made conflict reduction and even resolution possible. Following an adaptation process in response to the outcomes of the Six Day War, and the shifts from suppression to regulation, and vice versa, both sides experienced after the Yom Kippur War some learning process by which they became ready to transform their mode of thinking in the conflict. However, without the active encouragement of the USA. the learning process could not be developed. However, the Arab-Israeli conflict is not a single conflict, especially when analyzing and evaluating movements toward new forms of behavior in a given conflict system. The differences in the rate and scope of learning in each conflict influenced differently the shifts in conflict management, and from conflict management to conflict resolution. An initial learning process proved to be necessary for shifting from regulation to institutionalization, but this was not sufficient to move from institutionalization to resolution. There was a need for a further and deeper learning process to enable conflict resolution.

AB Objectives: To assess whether ChatGPT can help to identify predatory biomedical and dental journals, analyze the content of its responses and compare the frequency of positive and negative indicators provided by ChatGPT concerning predatory and legitimate journals. Methods: Four -hundred predatory and legitimate biomedical and dental journals were selected from four sources: Beall's list, unsolicited emails, the Web of Science (WOS) journal list and the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). ChatGPT was asked to determine journal legitimacy. Journals were classified into legitimate or predatory. Pearson's Chi -squared test and logistic regression were conducted. Two machine learning algorithms determined the most influential criteria on the correct classification of journals. Results: The data were categorized under 10 criteria with the most frequently coded criteria being the transparency of processes and policies. ChatGPT correctly classified predatory and legitimate journals in 92.5 % and 71 % of the sample, respectively. The accuracy of ChatGPT responses was 0.82. ChatGPT also demonstrated a high level of sensitivity (0.93). Additionally, the model exhibited a specificity of 0.71, accurately identifying true negatives. A highly significant association between ChatGPT verdicts and the classification based on known sources was observed (P <0.001). ChatGPT was 30.2 times more likely to correctly classify a predatory journal (95 % confidence interval: 16.9-57.43, p -value: <0.001). Conclusions: ChatGPT can accurately distinguish predatory and legitimate journals with a high level of accuracy. While some false positive (29 %) and false negative (7.5 %) results were observed, it may be reasonable to harness ChatGPT to assist with the identification of predatory journals. Clinical significance statement: ChatGPT may effectively distinguish between predatory and legitimate journals, with accuracy rates of 92.5 % and 71 %, respectively. The potential utility of large-scale language models in exposing predatory publications is worthy of further consideration.

AB With the advances of chip manufacturing technologies, computer architects have been able to integrate an increasing number of processors and other heterogeneous components on the same chip. Network-on-Chip (NoC) is widely employed by multicore System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures to cater to their communication requirements. NoC has received significant attention from both attackers and defenders. The increased usage of NoC and its distributed nature across the chip has made it a focal point of potential security attacks. Due to its prime location in the SoC coupled with connectivity with various components, NoC can be effectively utilized to implement security countermeasures to protect the SoC from potential attacks. There is a wide variety of existing literature on NoC security attacks and countermeasures. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of security vulnerabilities in NoC-based SoC architectures and discuss relevant countermeasures.

AB In this article, we introduce a parallelizing approximation-discovery framework, PANDORA, for automatically discovering application- and architecture-specialized approximations of provided code. PANDORA complements existing compilers and runtime optimizers by generating approximations with a range of Paretooptimal tradeoffs between performance and error, which enables adaptation to different inputs, different user preferences, and different runtime conditions (e.g., battery life). We demonstrate that PANDORA can create parallel approximations of inherently sequential code by discovering alternative implementations that eliminate loop-carried dependencies. For a variety of functions with loop-carried dependencies, PANDORA generates approximations that achieve speedups ranging from 2.3x to 81x, with acceptable error for many usage scenarios. We also demonstrate PANDORA's architecture-specialind approximations via FPGA experiments, and highlight PANDORA's discovery capabilities by removing loop-carried dependencies from a recurrence relation with no known closed-form solution.

AB Despite the development of powerful antiretroviral drugs, HIV-1 associated neurological disorders (HAND) will affect approximately half of those infected with HIV-1. Combined anti-retroviral therapy (cART) targets viral replication and increases T-cell counts, but it does not always control macrophage polarization, brain infection or inflammation. Moreover, it remains difficult to identify those at risk for HAND. New therapies that focus on modulating host immune response by making use of biological pathways could prove to be more effective than cART for the treatment of neuroAIDS. Additionally, while numerous HAND biomarkers have been suggested, they are of little use without methods for appropriate data integration and a systems-level interpretation. Machine learning, could be used to develop multifactorial computational models that provide clinicians and researchers with the ability to identify which factors (in what combination and relative importance) are considered important to outcome.

AB This paper describes how the real-time bandwidth of a radial basis neural network (RBNN) can be improved by the use of a field programmable gate array (FPGA). Accelerated performance is gained by moving the time-consuming RBNN exponential calculations from a general purpose processor to a dedicated FPGA that implements an optimized CORDIC-algorithm. The design methodology is presented and illustrated with a speech recognition application.

AB Designing single-molecule magnets (SMMs) for potential applications in quantum computing and high-density data storage requires tuning their magnetic properties, especially the strength of the magnetic interaction. These properties can be characterized by first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). In this work, we study the experimentally synthesized Co(II) dimer (Co-2(C5NH5)(4)(mu-PO2(CH2C6H5)(2))(3)) SMM with the goal to control the exchange energy, Delta E-J, between the Co atoms through tuning of the capping ligands. The experimentally synthesized Co(II) dimer molecule has a very small Delta E-J < 1 meV. We assemble a DFT data set of 1081 ligand substitutions for the Co(II) dimer. The ligand exchange provides a broad range of exchange energies, Delta E-J, from +50 to -200 meV, with 80% of the ligands yielding a small Delta E-J < 10 meV. We identify descriptors for the classification and regression of Delta E-J using gradient boosting machine learning models. We compare one-hot encoded, structure-based, and chemical descriptors consisting of the HOMO/LUMO energies of the individual ligands and the maximum electronegativity difference and bond order for the ligand atom connecting to Co. We observe a similar overall performance with the chemical descriptors outperforming the other descriptors. We show that the exchange coupling, Delta E-J, is correlated to the difference in the average bridging angle between the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic states, similar to the Goodenough-Kanamori rules.

TI Dynamical spin structure factor of one-dimensional interacting fermions
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW B
LA English
DT Article
ID SUSCEPTIBILITY; MODEL
AB We revisit the dynamic spin susceptibility chi(q, omega) of one-dimensional interacting fermions. To second order in the interaction, backscattering results in a logarithmic correction to chi(q, omega) at q << k(F), even if the single-particle spectrum is linearized near the Fermi points. Consequently, the dynamic spin structure factor Im chi(q, omega) is nonzero at frequencies above the single-particle continuum. In the boson language, this effect results from the marginally irrelevant backscattering operator of the sine-Gordon model. Away from the threshold, the high-frequency tail of Im chi(q, omega) due to backscattering is larger than that due to finite mass by a factor of k(F)/q. We derive the renormalization group equations for the coupling constants of the g-ology model at finite omega and q and find the corresponding expression for chi(q, omega), valid to all orders in the interaction but not in the immediate vicinity of the continuum boundary, where the finite-mass effects become dominant.

   Simplified capsule network; Contrastive learning
AB The concurrent use of multiple medications to treat one or more diseases is prevalent. Identifying N-ary drug combinations from biomedical texts aids in uncovering significant pharmacological effects triggered by drugdrug interactions. Previous methods for this emerging task have primarily concentrated on representing drug entities using pre-trained language models, overlooking the comprehensive extraction of contextual and taskspecific semantic information. To address these limitations, we develop a semantic fusion method grounded in machine reading comprehension (MRC) framework. Our model, termed Reading Comprehension powered semantic Fusion network for Identification of N-ary Drug combinations (RCFIND), first constructs relevant contexts and queries for each individual drug combination. Then, diverse information sources, including task-specific semantics, drug entity representations and contextual details, are fused by using a simplified Capsule network as well as incorporating contrastive learning. We assess RCFIND, achieving F1 scores ranging from 72.0% to 83.3% across four types of evaluations. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance enhancements over existing baselines, with at least a 5% F1 score improvement. Ablation studies and further analysis confirm the efficacy of the MRC framework and contrastive learning in accurately identifying N-ary drug combinations.

AB A sector is a component airspace whose operation is allocated to an air traffic controller. The operation complexity of a sector plays a critical role in the current Air Traffic Management system, e.g. it determines the workload volume of air traffic controllers and serves as a reliable index for airspace configuration and traffic flow management. Therefore, accurately evaluating the sector operation complexity is a problem of paramount importance in both practice and research. Due to numerous interacting factors, traditional methods based on only one single complexity indicator fail to accurately reflect the true complexity, especially when these factors are nonlinearly correlated. In light of these, the attempt to use machine learning models to mine the complex factor-complexity relationship has prevailed recently. The performance of these models however relies heavily on sufficient samples. The high cost of collecting ample data often results in a small training set, adversely impacting on the performance that these machine learning models can achieve. To overcome this problem, this paper for the first time proposes a new sector operation complexity evaluation framework based on knowledge transfer specifically for small-training-sample environment. The proposed framework is able to effectively mine knowledge hidden within the samples of the target sector, i.e. the sector undergoes evaluation, as well as other sectors, i.e. non-target sectors. Moreover, the framework can properly handle the integration between the knowledge derived from different sectors. Extensive experiments on real data of 6 sectors in China illustrate that our proposed framework can achieve promising performance on complexity evaluation when only a small training set of the target sector is available.

AB Data about the quality of cancer information that chatbots and other artificial intelligence systems provide are limited. Here, we evaluate the accuracy of cancer information on ChatGPT compared with the National Cancer Institute's (NCI's) answers by using the questions on the "Common Cancer Myths and Misconceptions" web page. The NCI's answers and ChatGPT answers to each question were blinded, and then evaluated for accuracy (accurate: yes vs no). Ratings were evaluated independently for each question, and then compared between the blinded NCI and ChatGPT answers. Additionally, word count and Flesch-Kincaid readability grade level for each individual response were evaluated. Following expert review, the percentage of overall agreement for accuracy was 100% for NCI answers and 96.9% for ChatGPT outputs for questions 1 through 13 (kappa = -0.03, standard error = 0.08). There were few noticeable differences in the number of words or the readability of the answers from NCI or ChatGPT. Overall, the results suggest that ChatGPT provides accurate information about common cancer myths and misconceptions.

AB Accurate prediction of traffic status in real time is critical for advanced traffic management and travel navigation guidance. There are many attempts to predict short-term traffic flows using various deep learning algorithms. Most existing prediction models are only tested on spatiotemporal data assuming no missing data entries. However, this ideal situation rarely exists in real world due to sensor or network transmission failure. Missing data is a nonnegligible problem. Previous studies either remove time series with missing entries or impute missing data before building prediction models. The former may cause insufficient data for model training, while the latter adds extra computational burden and the imputation accuracy has direct impacts on the prediction performance. In this study, we propose an online framework that can make spatiotemporal predictions based on raw incomplete data and impute possible missing values at the same time. We design a novel spatial and temporal regularized matrix factorization model, namely LSTM-GL-ReMF, as the key component of the framework. The Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) model is chosen as the temporal regularizer to capture temporal dependency in time series data and the Graph Laplacian (GL) serves as the spatial regularizer to utilize spatial correlations among network sensors to enhance prediction and imputation performance. The proposed framework integrating with the LSTM-GL-ReMF model are tested and compared with other state-of-the-art matrix factorization models and deep learning models on three uni-variate and multi-variate spatiotemporal traffic datasets. The experimental results show our approach has a robust and accurate performance in terms of prediction and imputation accuracy under various data missing scenarios.

AB Recently, maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) has been widely and successfully used in robust signal processing and machine learning, in which the correntropy is maximized instead of minimizing the popular mean square error (MSE) to improve the robustness with respect to outliers or impulsive noises. A lot of efforts have been devoted to derive different adaptive algorithms under MCC, but to date, little insight has been gained as to how the MCC solution will be influenced by outliers. In this paper, we investigate this problem and our focus is mainly on the parameter estimation of a simple linear errors-in-variables (EIVs) model with scalar variables. Under some conditions, we derive an upper bound on the absolute value of the estimation error and show that the MCC solution can get very close to the true value of the unknown parameter even with arbitrarily large outliers in both the input and output variables. Illustrative examples are provided to verify and clarify the theory.

AB Atmospheric density is the most important factor for accurate estimation of the drag force exerted on spacecraft at Low Earth orbits. Empirical models provide the most accurate estimation of the density currently available, although they still suffer from estimation errors. This work presents a novel approach based on Neural Networks for reducing the error in the density estimated by empirical models, along the orbit of a spacecraft. The Neural Networks take as inputs the density estimated by DTM-2013, NRLMSISE-00 and JB2008, three of the latest empirical atmospheric models available. Density estimated from the accelerometers of the CHAMP and GRACE missions are used as targets for the training, validation and testing of the Neural Networks. In addition, this work studies the use of the spacecraft's average speed as an input to the Neural Networks. The test results indicate that the Neural Networks produce density estimates with less error than the density from the three empirical models,studied. (C) 2015 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Jointly Optimized Spatial Histogram UNET Architecture (JOSHUA) for

DT Article
AB Objective. We aim to develop a machine learning algorithm to quantify adipose tissue deposition at surgical sites as a function of biomaterial implantation. Impact Statement. To our knowledge, this study is the first investigation to apply convolutional neural network (CNN) models to identify and segment adipose tissue in histological images from silk fibroin biomaterial implants. Introduction. When designing biomaterials for the treatment of various soft tissue injuries and diseases, one must consider the extent of adipose tissue deposition. In this work, we analyzed adipose tissue accumulation in histological images of sectioned silk fibroin-based biomaterials excised from rodents following subcutaneous implantation for 1, 2, 4, or 8 weeks. Current strategies for quantifying adipose tissue after biomaterial implantation are often tedious and prone to human bias during analysis. Methods. We used CNN models with novel spatial histogram layer(s) that can more accurately identify and segment regions of adipose tissue in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson's trichrome stained images, allowing for determination of the optimal biomaterial formulation. We compared the method, Jointly Optimized Spatial Histogram UNET Architecture (JOSHUA), to the baseline UNET model and an extension of the baseline model, attention UNET, as well as to versions of the models with a supplemental attention-inspired mechanism (JOSHUA+ and UNET+). Results. The inclusion of histogram layer(s) in our models shows improved performance through qualitative and quantitative evaluation. Conclusion. Our results demonstrate that the proposed methods, JOSHUA and JOSHUA+, are highly beneficial for adipose tissue identification and localization. The new histological dataset and code used in our experiments are publicly available.

AB I study the effects of financial players who trade alongside physical buyers and sellers in electricity markets. Using detailed firm-level data, I examine physical and financial firrns' responses to regulation that exogenously increased financial trading. I show that the effect of speculators on generators' market power depends on the kind of equilibrium they are in. I develop a test of the null of static Nash equilibrium and reject it. To implement the test, I present a new method to define markets using machine-learning tools. I find that increased financial trading reduced generators' market power and increased consumer surplus.

AB The commercialization of Brazil nuts, seeds of Bertholletia excelsa Bonpl. (Lecythidaceae), represents one of the main income-generation activities for local and indigenous people from the Brazilian Amazon region. Because trees of B. excelsa grow and bear fruit almost exclusively in natural forests, information on their spatial distribution is crucial for nut harvest planning. However, this information is difficult to obtain with traditional approaches such as ground-based surveys. Here, we show the potential of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and WorldView-3 satellite images (pixel size = 30 cm) to map individual tree crowns (ITCs) and groves of B. excelsa in Amazonian forests. First, we manually outlined B. excelsa ITCs in the WorldView-3 images using field-acquired geolocation information. Then, based on ITC boundaries, we sequentially extracted image patches and selected 80% of them for training and 20% for testing. We trained the DeepLabv3+ architecture with three backbones: ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and MobileNetV2. The average producer's accuracy was 93.87 +/- 0.85%, 93.89 +/- 1.6% and 93.47 +/- 3.6% for ResNet-18, ResNet-50 and MobileNetV2, respectively. We then developed a new random patch extraction training strategy and assessed how a reduction in the percentage of training patches impacted the classification accuracy. To illustrate the robustness of the new training strategy, similar F1scores were achieved whether 80% or 10% of the total number of patches were used to train the CNN model. By analyzing the feature maps derived from ResNet-18, we found that the shadow of emergent B. excelsa trees are important for their discrimination. Geometric distortions in the WorldView-3 images resulting from extreme offnadir viewing angles compromise the presence of shadows, thus potentially hampering B. excelsa detection. Our results show that ITCs and groves of B. excelsa can be mapped by integrating CNNs and very-high-resolution (VHR) satellite images, paving the way for monitoring this important tree species in large tracts of Amazonian forests.

AB Human Learning Optimization (HLO) is a simple yet powerful meta-heuristic developed based on a simplified human learning model. Many cognitive activities of humans contain an element of reasoning, and with reasoning, humans can gain deeper information on problems to boost learning performance. Inspired by this fact, this paper proposes a novel human learning optimization algorithm with reasoning learning (HLORL), in which a social reasoning learning operator (SRLO) is developed by using multiple social information sources to improve the global search ability of the algorithm. A parameter study is performed to give the recommended values of the control parameters. It also analyzes and discusses the role and function of the social reasoning learning operator. Finally, the proposed HLORL is applied to solve the CEC14 benchmark functions and 0-1 knapsack problems. The performance of HLORL is compared with the previous HLO variants and other state-of-art metaheuristics. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HLORL has significant advantages over the compared algorithms.

AB The extent of loss in a seismic hazard can be moderated with on-time allocation of funds and initiation of recovery tasks. Among various examinations conducted following the hazard, buildings damages are assessed as part of the reconnaissance survey to learn and document the impact of the earthquake on structures. The results of the survey are used in financial aid estimation, which is crucial for the community rapid recovery acts after the hazard. Due to the urgent need for this information, the amount of information gained per unit of time should be optimized. This article aims at answering the question of how to maximize the information gain in the presence of resource constraints by directing the efforts of a reconnaissance surveying team. A data-driven method is proposed that actively learns the patterns of damage and recommends the most informative buildings to be inspected while considering the resource limitations. The framework utilizes an efficient active learning method based on mutual information and developed for Gaussian process regression (GPR) to identify the information-rich cases. To assess the contribution of information gain and resource allocation in the overall outcome of the damage inference, two simulated earthquake testbeds are studied. It is shown that in a co-optimization approach, damage labels of the majority of buildings can be accurately predicted after 1 week of damage inspections.

TI Automating Building Damage Reconnaissance to Optimize Drone Mission

AB Rapid reconnaissance of building damage is critical for disaster response and recovery. Drones have been utilized to collect aerial images of affected areas in order to assess building damage. However, there are two challenges. First, processing many aerial images to detect and classify building damage based on a consistent standard remains laborious and complex, necessitating a new automated solution to achieve accurate building damage detection and classification. Second, drone operations during disaster response rely primarily on human operators' experience and seldom use the obtained building damage information to optimize drone mission planning. Therefore, this study proposes a new method, which automates building damage reconnaissance with drone mission planning for disaster response operations. Specifically, a deep learning method is developed to detect and classify building damages using a newly labeled dataset consisting of 24,496 distinct instances of building damage. This deep learning method is validated, achieving 71.9% mean average precision. In addition, building damage information is modeled and integrated into mission planning, in order to optimize drones' task assignments and route calculations. A tornado disaster in Tennessee is used as a case study to quantitatively evaluate this methodology. The present study concludes that optimal drone mission planning during disaster response can be augmented using accurate building damage information acquired from deep learning methods.

AB An expert system (ES) has been developed to assist citrus spray applicators in planning and evaluating their sprayer operations. The ES is partitioned into two parts: (1) spray planning (procedures and calculations for sprayer calibration as well as suitability of spraying under given weather parameters) and (2) spray evaluation (estimation of overall spray deposition, ground fallout, and drift as percentages of the total spray discharged at orchard scale). The first part is based on established procedures and the second part is built on the previously developed spray deposition model. The latter includes a "What-If" analysis function that gives feedback on changes in input variables and the corresponding outputs. Testing of the ES revealed that the trends in the outputs, reflecting the effects of application rate, travel speed, foliage density, and percent missing trees were in general agreement with literature. The ES was evaluated by five individuals with diverse experience in spray applications. Overall, the ES was found useful for calibration and evaluation of spray applications in citrus.

AB Background/Objectives: Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a prevalent form of skin cancer, presents diagnostic challenges, particularly in resource-limited settings with a low-quality imaging infrastructure. The accurate classification of SCC margins is essential to guide effective surgical interventions and reduce recurrence rates. This study proposes a vision transformer (ViT)-based model to improve SCC margin classification by addressing the limitations of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in analyzing low-quality histopathological images. Methods: This study introduced a transfer learning approach using a ViT architecture customized with additional flattening, batch normalization, and dense layers to enhance its capability for SCC margin classification. A performance evaluation was conducted using machine learning metrics averaged over five-fold cross-validation and comparisons were made with the leading CNN models. Ablation studies have explored the effects of architectural configuration on model performance. Results: The ViT-based model achieved superior SCC margin classification with 0.928 +/- 0.027 accuracy and 0.927 +/- 0.028 AUC, surpassing the highest performing CNN model, InceptionV3 (accuracy: 0.86 +/- 0.049; AUC: 0.837 +/- 0.029), demonstrating robustness of ViT over CNN for low-quality histopathological images. Ablation studies have reinforced the importance of tailored architectural configurations for enhancing diagnostic performance. Conclusions: This study underscores the transformative potential of ViTs in histopathological analysis, especially in resource-limited settings. By enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing dependence on high-quality imaging and specialized expertise, it presents a scalable solution for global cancer diagnostics. Future research should prioritize optimizing ViTs for such environments and broadening their clinical applications.

ID RACIAL-DISCRIMINATION; ENGLISH; BLACK; RACE
AB Research on bias in artificial intelligence has grown exponentially in recent years, especially around racial bias. Many modern technologies which impact people's lives have been shown to have significant racial biases, including automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Emerging studies have found that widely-used ASR systems function much more poorly on the speech of Black people. Yet, this work is limited because it lacks a deeper consideration of the sociolinguistic literature on African American Language (AAL). In this paper, then, we seek to integrate AAL research into these endeavors to analyze ways in which ASRs might be biased against the linguistic features of AAL and how the use of biased ASRs could prove harmful to speakers of AAL. Specifically, we (1) provide an overview of the ways in which AAL has been discriminated against in the workforce and healthcare in the past, and (2) explore how introducing biased ASRs in these areas could perpetuate or even deepen linguistic discrimination. We conclude with a number of questions for reflection and future work, offering this document as a resource for cross-disciplinary collaboration.

AB With all the power of von Neumann serial computation, emulation of certain tasks performed routinely by humans has been painfully slow.  Perhaps this is because there is evidence that human decision making results from massively parallel computation in the brain.  This evidence has generated interest in constructing models of parallel computation which are called artificial neural networks.  This paper outlines the fundamental architectures of artificial neural networks, details an artificial neural network which has potentially broad use, and reports on the results of its application to an important accounting problem that has been analyzed by other methods.  The results indicate that the neural network model performed well compared to an inductive rule-generating algorithm and logistic regression.

AB Delivery of compounds to the brain is critical for the development of effective treatment therapies of multiple central nervous system diseases. Recently a novel insect-based brain uptake model was published utilizing a locust brain ex vivo system. The goal of our study was to develop a priori, in silico cheminformatic models to describe brain uptake in this insect model, as well as evaluate the predictive ability. The machine learning program Orange (R) was used to evaluate several machine learning (ML) models on a published data set of 25 known drugs, with in vitro data generated by a single laboratory group to reduce inherent inter-laboratory variability. The ML models included in this study were linear regression (LR), support vector machines (SVN), k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and neural nets (NN). The quantitative structure-property relationship models were able to correlate experimental logCtot (concentration of compound in brain) and predicted brain uptake of r2 > 0.5, with the descriptors log(P*MW-0.5) and hydrogen bond donor used in LR, SVN and KNN, while log (P*MW-0.5) and total polar surface area (TPSA) descriptors used in the NN models. Our results indicate that the locust insect model is amenable to data mining chemoinformatics and in silico model development in CNS drug discovery pipelines.

AB ObjectivesArtificial intelligence is evolving and significantly impacting health care, promising to transform access to medical information. With the rise of medical misinformation and frequent internet searches for health-related advice, there is a growing demand for reliable patient information. This study assesses the effectiveness of ChatGPT in providing information and treatment options for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).MethodsSix inputs were entered into ChatGPT regarding the definition, prevalence, causes, symptoms, treatment options, and postoperative complications of CRS. International Consensus Statement on Allergy and Rhinology guidelines for Rhinosinusitis was the gold standard for evaluating the answers. The inputs were categorized into three categories and Flesch-Kincaid readability, ANOVA and trend analysis tests were used to assess them.ResultsAlthough some discrepancies were found regarding CRS, ChatGPT's answers were largely in line with existing literature. Mean Flesch Reading Ease, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level and passive voice percentage were (40.7%, 12.15%, 22.5%) for basic information and prevalence category, (47.5%, 11.2%, 11.1%) for causes and symptoms category, (33.05%, 13.05%, 22.25%) for treatment and complications, and (40.42%, 12.13%, 18.62%) across all categories. ANOVA indicated no statistically significant differences in readability across the categories (p-values: Flesch Reading Ease = 0.385, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level = 0.555, Passive Sentences = 0.601). Trend analysis revealed readability varied slightly, with a general increase in complexity.ConclusionChatGPT is a developing tool potentially useful for patients and medical professionals to access medical information. However, caution is advised as its answers may not be fully accurate compared to clinical guidelines or suitable for patients with varying educational backgrounds. Level of evidence: 4.ConclusionChatGPT is a developing tool potentially useful for patients and medical professionals to access medical information. However, caution is advised as its answers may not be fully accurate compared to clinical guidelines or suitable for patients with varying educational backgrounds. Level of evidence: 4.
   This study evaluates the capability of ChatGPT-an artificial intelligence chatbot-to provide accurate and readable information on chronic rhinosinusitis, comparing its responses against established medical guidelines. Findings reveal that while responses align generally with the literature; readability analyses the highlight areas of complexity that may challenge the patient understanding. The study underscores ChatGPT's potential in enhancing healthcare communication, emphasizing the need for accuracy, and readability adjustments to cater to diverse educational backgrounds. image

ID INHIBITOR
AB Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), which symmetrically dimethylates cytosolic and nuclear proteins, has been demonstrated as an important cancer therapeutic target. In recent years, many advanced achievements in PRMT5 inhibitor development have been made. Most PRMT5 inhibitors in the clinical trial focus on targeting the C-terminal catalytic domain, whereas developing small molecules to interrupt the PRMT5/pICLn (methylosome subunit) protein-protein interface is also of great importance for inhibiting PRMT5. Here, we describe a machine-learning-based virtual screening method and use this novel pipeline to screen small-molecule inhibitors of the PRMT5/pICLn interaction. 18 compounds were manually selected for experimental testing. One compound, Z319334062, showed surface plasmon resonance-binding affinity to the target (K D = 21.5 mu M) and dose-dependently inhibited symmetric dimethylation levels in patient-derived glioblastoma cell lines.

TI Automatic Code Converter Enhanced PCH Framework for SoC Trust

DT Article
DE Formal verification; hardware security; hardware trojan detection; model
   checking; proof-carrying hardware; theorem proving
AB The wide usage of hardware intellectual property cores from untrusted vendors has raised security concerns for system designers. Existing solutions for functionality testing and verification do not usually consider the presence of malicious logic in hardware. Formal methods provide powerful solutions for detecting malicious behaviors in hardware. However, they suffer from scalability issues and cannot be easily used for large-scale computing systems. To alleviate the scalability challenge, we propose a new integrated formal verification framework to evaluate the trust of system-on-chip (SoC) constructed from untrusted third-party hardware resources. This framework combines an automated model checker with an interactive theorem prover to reduce the time for proving the system-level security properties of SoCs. Another factor contributing to the scalability issue is the effort required for manual conversion of the hardware design from register transfer level (RTL) code to a domain-specific language prior to verification. Consequently, we develop an automatic code converter for translating VHSIC hardware description language (VHDL) to Formal-HDL, which is a domain specific language for representing hardware designs in the language of Coq. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our integrated verification framework and automated code conversion tool, we evaluate a vulnerable program executed on a bare metal LEON3 SPARC V8 processor and prove system security with considerable reduction in verification effort.

ID TOTAL HIP; TOTAL KNEE; 30-DAY READMISSION; RATES
AB Background: The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services currently incentivizes hospitals to reduce postdischarge adverse events such as unplanned hospital readmissions for patients who underwent total joint arthroplasty (TJA). This study aimed to predict 90-day TJA readmissions from our comprehensive electronic health record data and routinely collected patient-reported outcome measures. Methods: We retrospectively queried all TJA-related readmissions in our tertiary care center between 2016 and 2019. A total of 104-episode care characteristics and preoperative patient-reported outcome measures were used to develop several machine learning models for prediction performance evaluation and comparison. For interpretability, a logistic regression model was built to investigate the statistical significance, magnitudes, and directions of associations between risk factors and readmission. Results: Given the significant imbalanced outcome (5.8% of patients were readmitted), our models robustly predicted the outcome, yielding areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves over 0.8, recalls over 0.5, and precisions over 0.5. In addition, the logistic regression model identified risk factors predicting readmission: diabetes, preadmission medication prescriptions (ie, nonsteroidal antiin0ammatory drug, corticosteroid, and narcotic), discharge to a skilled nursing facility, and postdischarge care behaviors within 90 days. Notably, low self-reported confidence to carry out social activities accurately predicted readmission. Conclusions: A machine learning model can help identify patients who are at substantially increased risk of a readmission after TJA. This finding may allow for health-care providers to increase resources targeting these patients. In addition, a poor response to the "social activities" question may be a useful indicator that predicts a significant increased risk of readmission after TJA. (c) 2023 The Authors.

AB This paper reports on a study investigating transportation professionals' perceptions of AI's equity impacts in the transportation sector, focusing on demographic variations in views. A survey conducted among U.S. transportation professionals examined their attitudes toward AI's potential to influence transportation equity and ethics. The findings reveal insights based on gender, employment sector, educational background, and AI knowledge level, with notable differences in confidence towards AI's ability to reduce bias and engage communities. This research highlights a commonly held opinion that there is a limited understanding of AI ethics within the transportation community, emphasizing the need for ongoing education and adaptation to AI technologies. This study contributes valuable perspectives to the discourse on AI, equity, and ethics in transportation, offering a foundation for future policy and strategy development.

AB Although support vector machine (SVM) and its variants have been combined successfully with partitioning strategies for multiclass classification, a series of individual classifiers have to be considered separately, which significantly limits the sparseness of the solution. In this work, from an absolutely novel perspective, we proposed a regular simplex support vector machine (RSSVM) for the K-class classification. RSSVM maps the K classes to K vertices of a (K - 1)-dimensional regular simplex so that the K-class classification becomes a (K - 1)-output learning task. We measured the training loss by comparing the square distances between the output point of each sample and the vertices. As a result, we were able to implement RSSVM by constructing a single primal problem with linear inequality constraints, endowing it with excellent sparseness. This method, however, made the computational complexity of RSSVM higher than commonly used K-class classification methods. To overcome this drawback, we added an appropriate regularized term to the primal problem, making the dual problem a quadratic programming problem, and we developed an exclusive sequential minimization optimization-type solver to accelerate our ability to solve it. Numerical experiments indicated that our proposed RSSVM not only demonstrated excellent sparseness but also superior overall accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

DE Multi-label classification; PubMed; Rank-SVM
AB In this paper, we have developed an automated multi-label linking scheme for PubMed citations with gene ontology (GO) terms, which enables users to have easy access to relevant publications according to various biomedical ontological terms (in particular, GO terms). We propose a maximum margin approach derived from ranking support vector machine (Rank-SVM), called SCRank-SVM. In this scheme, we remove the term bias "b'' and recast the decision boundary and the separating margin to improve the margin of Rank-SVM. Due to the weaker optimization constraints, SCRank-SVM has better generalization performance and lower computational complexity. Experiments on our lung cancer data set and 6 diverse multi-label data sets show that SCRank-SVM is quite suitable to solve our problem. The performance of SCRank-SVM is superior to that of the original Rank-SVM and some other well-established multi-label learning algorithms.

AB Because of its involvement in a wide variety of cardiovascular, metabolic and behavioural functions, the hypothalamus constitutes a potential target for neuromodulation in a number of treatment-refractory conditions. The precise neural substrates and circuitry subserving these responses, however, are poorly characterized to date.
   We sought to retrospectively explore the acute sequelae of hypothalamic region deep brain stimulation and characterize their neuroanatomical correlates. To this end we studied-at multiple international centres-58 patients (mean age: 68.5 +/- 7.9 years, 26 females) suffering from mild Alzheimer's disease who underwent stimulation of the fornix region between 2007 and 2019. We catalogued the diverse spectrum of acutely induced clinical responses during electrical stimulation and interrogated their neural substrates using volume of tissue activated modelling, voxel-wise mapping, and supervised machine learning techniques.
   In total 627 acute clinical responses to stimulation-including tachycardia, hypertension, flushing, sweating, warmth, coldness, nausea, phosphenes, and fear-were recorded and catalogued across patients using standard descriptive methods. The most common manifestations during hypothalamic region stimulation were tachycardia (30.9%) and warmth (24.6%) followed by flushing (9.1%) and hypertension (6.9%). Voxel-wise mapping identified distinct, locally separable clusters for all sequelae that could be mapped to specific hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic grey and white matter structures. K-nearest neighbour classification further validated the clinico-anatomical correlates emphasizing the functional importance of identified neural substrates with area under the receiving operating characteristic curves between 0.67 and 0.91.
   Overall, we were able to localize acute effects of hypothalamic region stimulation to distinct tracts and nuclei within the hypothalamus and the wider diencephalon providing clinico-anatomical insights that may help to guide future neuromodulation work.

AB A major goal of neuroscience is to understand the relationship between neural structures and their function. Recording of neural activity with arrays of electrodes is a primary tool employed toward this goal. However, the relationships among the neural activity recorded by these arrays are often highly complex making it problematic to accurately quantify a network's structural information and then relate that structure to its function. Current statistical methods including cross correlation and coherence have achieved only modest success in characterizing the structural connectivity. Over the last decade an alternative technique known as Granger causality is emerging within neuroscience. This technique, borrowed from the field of economics, provides a strong mathematical foundation based on linear auto-regression to detect and quantify "causal'' relationships among different time series. This paper presents a combination of three Granger based analytical methods that can quickly provide a relatively complete representation of the causal structure within a neural network. These are a simple pairwise Granger causality metric, a conditional metric, and a little known computationally inexpensive subtractive conditional method. Each causal metric is first described and evaluated in a series of biologically plausible neural simulations. We then demonstrate how Granger causality can detect and quantify changes in the strength of those relationships during plasticity using 60 channel spike train data from an in vitro cortical network measured on a microelectrode array. We show that these metrics can not only detect the presence of causal relationships, they also provide crucial information about the strength and direction of that relationship, particularly when that relationship maybe changing during plasticity. Although we focus on the analysis of multichannel spike train data the metrics we describe are applicable to any stationary time series in which causal relationships among multiple measures is desired. These techniques can be especially useful when the interactions among those measures are highly complex, difficult to untangle, and maybe changing over time.

AB Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in various domains, including image recognition, medical diagnosis and autonomous driving. Recent advances in dataflow-based CNN accelerators have enabled CNN inference in resource-constrained edge devices. These dataflow accelerators utilize inherent data reuse of convolution layers to process CNN models efficiently. Concealing the architecture of CNN models is critical for privacy and security. This article evaluates memory-based side-channel information to recover CNN architectures from dataflow-based CNN inference accelerators. The proposed attack exploits spatial and temporal data reuse of the dataflow mapping on CNN accelerators and architectural hints to recover the structure of CNN models. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed side-channel attack can recover the structures of popular CNN models, namely, Lenet, Alexnet, VGGnet16, and YOLOv2.

AB Robust automated vortex detection algorithms are needed to facilitate the exploration of large-scale turbulent fluid flow simulations. Unfortunately, robust non-local vortex detection algorithms are computationally intractable for large data sets and local algorithms, while computationally tractable, lack robustness. We argue that the deficiencies inherent to the local definitions occur because of two fundamental issues: the lack of a rigorous definition of a vortex and the fact that a vortex is an intrinsically non-local phenomenon. As a first step towards addressing this problem, we demonstrate the use of machine learning techniques to enhance the robustness of local vortex detection algorithms. We motivate the presence of an expert-in-the-loop using empirical results based on machine learning techniques. We employ adaptive boosting to combine a suite of widely used, local vortex detection algorithms, which we term weak classifiers, into a robust compound classifier. Fundamentally, the training phase of the algorithm, in which an expert manually labels small, spatially contiguous regions of the data, incorporates non-local information into the resulting compound classifier. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by applying the compound classifier to two data sets obtained from computational fluid dynamical simulations. Our results demonstrate that the compound classifier has a reduced misclassification rate relative to the component classifiers.

AB Oxide perovskite materials of type ABO3 have a wide range of technological applications, such as catalysts in solid oxide fuel cells and as light-absorbing materials in solar photovoltaics. These materials often exhibit differential structural and electrostatic properties through their varied A-sites and B-sites especially if they are derived from lanthanides. Although, experimental and/or computational verification of these differences are often difficult and expensive. In this paper, we thus take a data-driven approach. Specifically, we run three analysis using the dataset by [1] applying advanced machine learning tools to perform nonparametric regressions and also to produce data visualizations using latent factor analysis (LFA) and principal component analysis (PCA). We also implement a nonparametric feature screening step while performing our high dimensional regression analysis, ensuring robustness in our results.

AB The current study adds to a growing body of behavioral research aimed at learning about changes in behavior over time. In this proof-of-concept study, functional analyses were conducted every 6-8 weeks with eight children diagnosed with ASD receiving early intervention services at a community-based clinic. The goal of this study was to develop a method for assessing participants' general sensitivity to common reinforcement contingencies and relative response allocation to problem and appropriate behavior across time. To accomplish this, we reinforced the first instance of either problem behavior or appropriate behavior during functional analyses. Reinforcing appropriate behavior allowed us to fulfill the goals of this study while avoiding deleterious effects on ongoing clinical treatment and ethical concerns about repeatedly exposing participants to assessment contexts that favor problem behavior. The clinical utility of the described approach and avenues for future research are discussed.

ID ALGORITHM
AB Human Learning Optimization (HLO) is a simple yet efficient binary meta-heuristic, in which three learning operators, i.e. the random learning operator (RLO), individual learning operator (ILO) and social learning operator (SLO), are developed to mimic human learning mechanisms to solve optimization problems. Among these three operators, RLO directly influences the exploration and exploitation abilities of HLO, and therefore its control parameter pr is of great importance since it controls the balance between exploration and exploitation. In this paper, an adaptive human learning optimization with enhanced exploration-exploitation balance (AHLOee) is proposed to improve the performance of HLO, in which a new adaptive pr strategy is carefully designed to meet the different requirements of HLO at different stages of iterations. A comprehensive parameter study is performed to evaluate the influences of the proposed adaptive strategy on exploration and exploitation, and then the deep insights on the role of RLO and the reason why the proposed adaptive strategy can achieve a practically ideal trade-off between exploration and exploitation are provided. The experimental results on the CEC05 and CEC15 benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed AHLOee has advantages over previous HLO variants and outperforms recent state-of-art binary meta-heuristics.

AB Time-domain astronomy (TDA) is facing a paradigm shift caused by the exponential growth of the sample size, data complexity and data generation rates of new astronomical sky surveys. For example, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), which will begin operations in northern Chile in 2022, will generate a nearly 150 Petabyte imaging dataset of the southern hemisphere sky. The LSST will stream data at rates of 2 Terabytes per hour, effectively capturing an unprecedented movie of the sky. The LSST is expected not only to improve our understanding of time-varying astrophysical objects, but also to reveal a plethora of yet unknown faint and fast-varying phenomena. To cope with a change of paradigm to data-driven astronomy, the fields of astroinformatics and astrostatistics have been created recently. The new data-oriented paradigms for astronomy combine statistics, data mining, knowledge discovery, machine learning and computational intelligence, in order to provide the automated and robust methods needed for the rapid detection and classification of known astrophysical objects as well as the unsupervised characterization of novel phenomena. In this article we present an overview of machine learning and computational intelligence applications to TDA. Future big data challenges and new lines of research in TDA, focusing on the LSST, are identified and discussed from the viewpoint of computational intelligence/machine learning. Interdisciplinary collaboration will be required to cope with the challenges posed by the deluge of astronomical data coming from the LSST.

DT Review
DE Shared decision making; Large language models; Neuro-oncology care;
   Patient engagement; Ethical considerations; Healthcare integration
AB Shared decision-making (SDM) is crucial in neuro-oncology, fostering collaborations between patients and healthcare professionals to navigate treatment options. However, the complexity of neuro-oncological conditions and the cognitive and emotional burdens on patients present significant barriers to achieving effective SDM. This discussion explores the potential of large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Bard to overcome these barriers, offering a means to enhance patient understanding and engagement in their care. LLMs, by providing accessible, personalized information, could support but not supplant the critical insights of healthcare professionals. The hypothesis suggests that patients, better informed through LLMs, may participate more actively in their treatment choices. Integrating LLMs into neuro-oncology requires navigating ethical considerations, including safeguarding patient data and ensuring informed consent, alongside the judicious use of AI technologies. Future efforts should focus on establishing ethical guidelines, adapting healthcare workflows, promoting patient-oriented research, and developing training programs for clinicians on the use of LLMs. Continuous evaluation of LLM applications will be vital to maintain their effectiveness and alignment with patient needs. Ultimately, this exploration contends that the thoughtful integration of LLMs into SDM processes could significantly enhance patient involvement and strengthen the patient-physician relationship in neuro-oncology care.

AB An infinite horizon approximate optimal control problem is developed for a system with unknown drift parameters and control effectiveness faults. A data-based filtered parameter estimator with a novel dynamic gain structure is developed to simultaneously estimate the unknown drift dynamics and control effectiveness fault. A local state-following approximate dynamic programming method is used to approximate the unknown optimal value function for an uncertain system. Using a relaxed persistence of excitation condition, a Lyapunov-based stability analysis shows exponential convergence to a residual error for the parameter estimation and uniformly ultimately bounded convergence for the closed-loop system. Simulation results are presented which demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed method. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI Using Machine Learning to Evaluate Attending Feedback on Resident
   Performance
SO ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA
LA English
DT Article
ID FACULTY
AB BACKGROUND:
   High-quality and high-utility feedback allows for the development of improvement plans for trainees. The current manual assessment of the quality of this feedback is time consuming and subjective. We propose the use of machine learning to rapidly distinguish the quality of attending feedback on resident performance.
   METHODS:
   Using a preexisting databank of 1925 manually reviewed feedback comments from 4 anesthesiology residency programs, we trained machine learning models to predict whether comments contained 6 predefined feedback traits (actionable, behavior focused, detailed, negative feedback, professionalism/communication, and specific) and predict the utility score of the comment on a scale of 1-5. Comments with >= 4 feedback traits were classified as high-quality and comments with >= 4 utility scores were classified as high-utility; otherwise comments were considered low-quality or low-utility, respectively. We used RapidMiner Studio (RapidMiner, Inc, Boston, MA), a data science platform, to train, validate, and score performance of models.
   RESULTS:
   Models for predicting the presence of feedback traits had accuracies of 74.4%-82.2%. Predictions on utility category were 82.1% accurate, with 89.2% sensitivity, and 89.8% class precision for low-utility predictions. Predictions on quality category were 78.5% accurate, with 86.1% sensitivity, and 85.0% class precision for low-quality predictions. Fifteen to 20 hours were spent by a research assistant with no prior experience in machine learning to become familiar with software, create models, and review performance on predictions made. The program read data, applied models, and generated predictions within minutes. In contrast, a recent manual feedback scoring effort by an author took 15 hours to manually collate and score 200 comments during the course of 2 weeks.
   CONCLUSIONS:
   Harnessing the potential of machine learning allows for rapid assessment of attending feedback on resident performance. Using predictive models to rapidly screen for low-quality and low-utility feedback can aid programs in improving feedback provision, both globally and by individual faculty.

AB E-cigarette use is increasing among young adult never smokers of conventional cigarettes, but the awareness of the factors associated with e-cigarette use in this population is limited. The goal of this work was to use machine learning (ML) algorithms to determine the factors associated with current e-cigarette use among US young adult never cigarette smokers. Young adult (18-34 years) never cigarette smokers from the 2016 and 2017 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) who reported current or never e-cigarette use were used for the analysis (n = 79,539). Variables associated with current e-cigarette use were selected by two ML algorithms (Boruta and Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)). Odds ratios were calculated to determine the association between e-cigarette use and the variables selected by the ML algorithms, after adjusting for age, gender and race/ethnicity and incorporating the BRFSS complex design. The prevalence of e-cigarette use varied across states. Factors previously reported in the literature, such as age, race/ethnicity, alcohol use, depression, as well as novel factors associated with e-cigarette use, such as disabilities, obesity, history of diabetes and history of arthritis were identified. These results can be used to generate further hypotheses for research, increase public awareness and help provide targeted e-cigarette education.

ID WALKING SPEED; DIAGNOSIS; KERNEL
AB Quantitative gait assessment is important in diagnosis and management of Parkinson's disease (PD); however, gait characteristics of a cohort are dispersed by patient physical properties including age, height, body mass, and gender, as well as walking speed, which may limit capacity to discern some pathological features. The aim of this study was twofold. First, to use a multiple regression normalization strategy that accounts for subject age, height, body mass, gender, and self-selected walking speed to identify differences in spatial-temporal gait features between PD patients and controls; and second, to evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning strategies in classifying PDgait after gait normalization. Spatial-temporal gait data during self-selected walking were obtained from 23 PD patients and 26 aged-matched controls. Data were normalized using standard dimensionless equations and multiple regression normalization. Machine learning strategies were then employed to classify PD gait using the raw gait data, data normalized using dimensionless equations, and data normalized using the multiple regression approach. After normalizing data using the dimensionless equations, only stride length, step length, and double support time were significantly different between PD patients and controls (p < 0.05); however, normalizing data using the multiple regression method revealed significant differences in stride length, cadence, stance time, and double support time. Random Forest resulted in a PD classification accuracy of 92.6% after normalizing gait data using the multiple regression approach, compared to 80.4% (support vector machine) and 86.2% (kernel Fisher discriminant) using raw data and data normalized using dimensionless equations, respectively. Our multiple regression normalization approach will assist in diagnosis and treatment of PD using spatial-temporal gait data.

AB Readmission or death soon after heart failure (HF) admission is a significant problem. Traditional analyses for predicting such events often fail to consider the gamut of characteristics that may contribute- tending to focus on 30-day outcomes even though the window of increased vulnerability may last up to 90 days. Risk assessments incorporating machine learning (ML) methods may be better suited than traditional statistical analyses alone to sort through multitude of data in the electronic health record (EHR) and identify patients at higher risk.
   Hypothesis ML-based decision analysis may better identify patients at increased risk for 90-day acute HF readmission or death after incident HF admission.
   Methods and Results Among 3189 patients who underwent index HF hospitalization, 15.2% experienced primary or acute HF readmission and 11.5% died within 90 days. For risk assessment models, 98 variables were considered across nine data categories. ML techniques were used to help select variables for a final logistic regression (LR) model. The final model's AUC was 0.760 (95% CI 0.752 to 0.767), with sensitivity of 83%. This proved superior to an LR model alone [AUC 0.744 (95% CI 0.732 to 0.755)]. Eighteen variables were identified as risk factors including dilated inferior vena cava, elevated blood pressure, elevated BUN, reduced albumin, abnormal sodium or bicarbonate, and NT pro-BNP elevation. A risk prediction ML-based model developed from comprehensive characteristics within the EHR can efficiently identify patients at elevated risk of 90-day acute HF readmission or death for whom closer follow-up or further interventions may be considered.

AB Two groups of rats, one rewarded with sweetened food and the other rewarded with medial forebrain bundle (MFB) stimulation, were trained to home in on and dig for a buried object coated with a target odor. After each group had 15 training trials, MFB rats searched with greater accuracy and speed than food-rewarded rats. MFB rats were subsequently tested (1) after 6 weeks with no additional practice; (2) with food or non-food distractor odors, and (3) with major spatial alterations to the search environment, and in all cases searched with the same high accuracy, short search time, and low level of distractibility as in baseline. These results suggest that the high motivation provided by MFB reward engenders rapidly formed, long-lasting, and surprisingly flexibly deployable "habit" memories. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

LA English
DT Article
ID ELECTRONIC-PROPERTIES; SOLAR-CELLS; COPOLYMERS; EFFICIENCY; OLIGOMERS
AB Conjugated polymers (CPs), characterized by alternating sigma and pi bonds, have attracted significant attention for their diverse structures and adjustable electronic properties. However, predicting the optical band gap (Eexpgap) of CPs remains challenging. This study presents a rational model that integrates density functional theory (DFT) calculation with a data-driven machine learning (ML) approach to predict the experimentally measured Eexpgap of CPs, using 1096 data points. Through alkyl side chain truncation and conjugated backbone extension, the modified oligomers effectively capture the electronic properties of CPs, significantly improving the correlation between the DFT-calculated HOMO-LUMO gap (Eoligomergap) and Eexpgap (R2 = 0.51) compared to the unmodified side-chain-containing monomers (R2 = 0.15). Moreover, we trained six ML models with two categories of features as input: Eoligomergap to represent the extended backbone and molecular features of unmodified monomers to capture the alkyl-side-chain effect. The best model, XGBoost-2, achieved an R2 of 0.77 and an MAE of 0.065 eV for predicting Eexpgap, falling within the experimental error margin of similar to 0.1 eV. We further validated XGBoost-2 on a dataset of 227 newly synthesized CPs collected from literature without further retraining. Notably, XGBoost-2 exhibits both excellent interpolation for BT-, BTA-, QA-, DPP-, and TPD-based CPs, and exceptional extrapolation for PDI-, NDI-, DTBT-, BBX-, and Y6-based CPs, which are attributed to the integration of DFT methods with rationally designed oligomer structures. For the first time, we demonstrated a novel and effective strategy combining quantum chemistry calculations with ML modeling for accurate and efficient prediction of experimentally measured fundamental properties of CPs. Our study paves the way for the accelerated design and development of high-performance CPs in photoelectronic applications.

AB Objectives: To identify prodromal correlates of asthma as compared to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and allied-conditions (COPDAC) using a multi domain analysis of socio-ecological, clinical, and demographic domains. Methods: This is a retrospective case-risk-control study using data from Florida's statewide Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). Patients were grouped into three groups: asthma, COPDAC (without asthma), and neither asthma nor COPDAC. To identify socio-ecological, clinical, demographic, and clinical predictors of asthma and COPDAC, we used univariate analysis, feature ranking by bootstrapped information gain ratio, multivariable logistic regression with LogitBoost selection, decision trees, and random forests. Results: A total of 141,729 patients met inclusion criteria, of whom 56,052 were diagnosed with asthma, 85,677 with COPDAC, and 84,737 with neither asthma nor COPDAC. The multi-domain approach proved superior in distinguishing asthma versus COPDAC and non-asthma/non-COPDAC controls (area under the curve (AUROC) 84%). The best domain to distinguish asthma from COPDAC without controls was prior clinical diagnoses (AUROC 82%). Ranking variables from all the domains found the most important predictors for the asthma versus COPDAC and controls were primarily socio-ecological variables, while for asthma versus COPDAC without controls, demographic and clinical variables such as age, CCI, and prior clinical diagnoses, scored better. Conclusions: In this large statewide study using a machine learning approach, we found that a multi-domain approach with demographics, clinical, and socio-ecological variables best predicted an asthma diagnosis. Future work should focus on integrating machine learning-generated predictive models into clinical practice to improve early detection of those common respiratory diseases.

AB Heterogeneous electrocatalysts exhibit immense potential for advancing energy technologies. However, the constraints associated with noble metals have sparked a surge of interest in the exploration of single-atom catalysts and metal-carbon hybrids as alternative options. Designing metal sites in carbon-based materials has demonstrated high activity, selectivity, stability, and cost-effectiveness in various electrochemical reactions. In spite of these advantages, the intricate nature of the designed structures and the expansive design space encompassing potential metal site structures pose formidable challenges in terms of experimental characterization and optimization. To address these challenges, computational approaches have emerged as powerful tools to accelerate the discovery of new metal sites in carbon-based materials and understand the structure-catalytic property relationships for electrocatalysis. In this review paper, we provide an overview of the state-of-the-art computational approaches from reported modeled structures, theoretical foundations of computational methods in modeling electrochemical reactions, to the data-driven approaches to accelerate new catalyst design. We summarize the utilization of structure-binding energy relationships, virtual high-throughput screening methods, and machine learning techniques to explore a wide range of metal site structures and identify promising candidates for experimental validation. Furthermore, the review highlights the importance of considering the solvent effect and the impact of spin/oxidation states on extra electron transfer to enhance the accuracy of predicting binding energies. Finally, we summarize the current challenges and offer a brief perspective on future opportunities in the field of computational acceleration for carbon-based catalyst development.
   Computational approaches including quantum simulations, virtual high-throughput screening and machine learning accelerate the advance electrocatalysts discovery with proper accuracy and efficiency.

AB This study examines the use of the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) in Sentinel-2 satellite in combination with regression-based random forest models to estimate bathymetry along the extended southwestern Florida nearshore region. In this study, we focused on the development of a framework leading to a generalized Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) model applicable to an extensive and diversified coastal region (>200 km of coastline) utilizing multi-date images. The model calibration and validation were done using airborne lidar bathymetry (ALB). As ALB surveys are very expensive to conduct, the proposed model was trained with a limited and practically feasible ALB data sample to expand the model's practicality. Out of the three different sub-models introduced using varying combinations of historical satellite imagery, the combined-band model with the largest feature pool yielded the highest accuracy. The results showed root mean square error (RMSE) values of 8% and lower for the 0-13.5 m depth range (limit of the lidar surveys used) for all areas of interest, indicating the model efficiency and adaptability to varying coastal characteristics. The influence of training sample locations on model performance was evaluated using three distinct model configurations. The difference between these configurations was less than 5 cm, which highlights the robustness of the proposed SDB model. The quality of the satellite imagery is a significant factor that influences the accuracy of the bathymetry estimation. A preliminary methodology incorporating spectral data embedded in Sentinel-2 imagery to effectively select the most optimal satellite imagery was also proposed in this study.

AB Online approximation of the optimal station-keeping strategy for a marine craft subject to an irrotational current is considered. An approximate policy that minimizes a user-defined cost function over an infinite time horizon is obtained using an actor-critic-identifier-based adaptive dynamic programming technique. The hydrodynamic drift dynamics are assumed to be unknown; therefore, a concurrent learning-based system identifier is developed to identify the unknown model parameters. The identified model is used to implement an adaptive model-based reinforcement learning technique to estimate the unknown value function. The developed policy guarantees uniformly ultimately bounded convergence of the vehicle to the desired station and uniformly ultimately bounded convergence of the approximated policies to the optimal polices without the requirement of persistence of excitation. The developed strategy is validated using an autonomous underwater vehicle, where the three degrees-of-freedom in the horizontal plane are regulated. The experiments are conducted in a second-magnitude spring located in central Florida.

AB Immunotherapy has limited efficacy in GBM. The authors develop and use a machine learning approach to identify cell fate determinants that force GBM cells to acquire DC-like functions, establishing an immunotherapy that is effective in GBM models.
   Immunotherapy has limited efficacy in glioblastoma (GBM) due to the blood-brain barrier and the immunosuppressed or "cold" tumor microenvironment (TME) of GBM, which is dominated by immune-inhibitory cells and depleted of CTL and dendritic cells (DC). Here, we report the development and application of a machine learning precision method to identify cell fate determinants (CFD) that specifically reprogram GBM cells into induced antigen-presenting cells with DC-like functions (iDC-APC). In murine GBM models, iDC-APCs acquired DC-like morphology, regulatory gene expression profile, and functions comparable to natural DCs. Among these acquired functions were phagocytosis, direct presentation of endogenous antigens, and cross-presentation of exogenous antigens. The latter endowed the iDC-APCs with the ability to prime na & iuml;ve CD8+ CTLs, a hallmark DC function critical for antitumor immunity. Intratumor iDC-APCs reduced tumor growth and improved survival only in immunocompetent animals, which coincided with extensive infiltration of CD4+ T cells and activated CD8+ CTLs in the TME. The reactivated TME synergized with an intratumor soluble PD1 decoy immunotherapy and a DC-based GBM vaccine, resulting in robust killing of highly resistant GBM cells by tumor-specific CD8+ CTLs and significantly extended survival. Lastly, we defined a unique CFD combination specifically for the human GBM to iDC-APC conversion of both glioma stem-like cells and non-stem-like cell GBM cells, confirming the clinical utility of a computationally directed, tumor-specific conversion immunotherapy for GBM and potentially other solid tumors.

TI Phylogenetic-informed graph deep learning to classify dynamic

SO BIOINFORMATICS ADVANCES

ID EVOLUTION; PATTERNS; NETWORK
AB Motivation: In the midst of an outbreak, identification of groups of individuals that represent risk for transmission of the pathogen under investigation is critical to public health efforts. Dynamic transmission patterns within these clusters, whether it be the result of changes at the level of the virus (e.g. infectivity) or host (e.g. vaccination), are critical in strategizing public health interventions, particularly when resources are limited. Phylogenetic trees are widely used not only in the detection of transmission clusters, but the topological shape of the branches within can be useful sources of information regarding the dynamics of the represented population. Results: We evaluated the limitation of existing tree shape metrics when dealing with dynamic transmission clusters and propose instead a phylogeny-based deep learning system - DeepDynaTree -for dynamic classification. Comprehensive experiments carried out on a variety of simulated epidemic growth models and HIV epidemic data indicate that this graph deep learning approach is effective, robust, and informative for cluster dynamic prediction. Our results confirm that DeepDynaTree is a promising tool for transmission cluster characterization that can be modified to address the existing limitations and deficiencies in knowledge regarding the dynamics of transmission trajectories for groups at risk of pathogen infection.

AB Communication limitation at the edge is widely recognized as a major bottleneck for federated learning (FL). Multi-hop wireless networking provides a cost-effective solution to enhance service coverage and spectrum efficiency at the edge, which could facilitate large-scale and efficient machine learning (ML) model aggregation. However, FL over multi-hop wireless networks has rarely been investigated. In this paper, we optimize FL over wireless mesh networks by taking into account the heterogeneity in communication and computing resources at mesh routers and clients. We present a framework that each intermediate router performs in-network model aggregation before sending the data to the next hop, so as to reduce the outgoing data traffic and hence aggregate more models under limited communication resources. To accelerate model training, we formulate our optimization problem by jointly considering model aggregation, routing, and spectrum allocation. Although the problem is a non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming, we transform it into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), and develop a coarse-grained fixing procedure to solve it efficiently. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the solution approach, and the superiority of the in-network aggregation scheme over the counterpart without in-network aggregation.

AB Objective. UNet-based deep-learning (DL) architectures are promising dose engines for traditional linear accelerator (Linac) models. Current UNet-based engines, however, were designed differently with various strategies, making it challenging to fairly compare the results from different studies. The objective of this study is to thoroughly evaluate the performance of UNet-based models on magnetic-resonance (MR)-Linac-based intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) dose calculations. Approach. The UNet-based models, including the standard-UNet, cascaded-UNet, dense-dilated-UNet, residual-UNet, HD-UNet, and attention-aware-UNet, were implemented. The model input is patient CT and IMRT field dose in water, and the output is patient dose calculated by DL model. The reference dose was calculated by the Monaco Monte Carlo module. Twenty training and ten test cases of prostate patients were included. The accuracy of the DL-calculated doses was measured using gamma analysis, and the calculation efficiency was evaluated by inference time. Results. All the studied models effectively corrected low-accuracy doses in water to high-accuracy patient doses in a magnetic field. The gamma passing rates between reference and DL-calculated doses were over 86% (1%/1 mm), 98% (2%/2 mm), and 99% (3%/3 mm) for all the models. The inference times ranged from 0.03 (graphics processing unit) to 7.5 (central processing unit) seconds. Each model demonstrated different strengths in calculation accuracy and efficiency; Res-UNet achieved the highest accuracy, HD-UNet offered high accuracy with the fewest parameters but the longest inference, dense-dilated-UNet was consistently accurate regardless of model levels, standard-UNet had the shortest inference but relatively lower accuracy, and the others showed average performance. Therefore, the best-performing model would depend on the specific clinical needs and available computational resources. Significance. The feasibility of using common UNet-based models for MR-Linac-based dose calculations has been explored in this study. By using the same model input type, patient training data, and computing environment, a fair assessment of the models' performance was present.

AB Background After incident heart failure (HF) admission, patients are vulnerable to readmission or death in the 90-day post-discharge. Although risk models for readmission or death incorporate ejection fraction (EF), patients with HF with preserved EF (HFpEF) and those with HF with reduced EF (HFrEF) represent distinct cohorts. To better assess risk, this study developed machine learning models and identified risk factors for the 90-day acute HF readmission or death by HF subtype. Methods and Results Approximately 1965 patients with HFpEF and 1124 with HFrEF underwent an index admission. Acute HF rehospitalization or death occurred in 23% of HFpEF and 28% of HFrEF groups. Of the 101 variables considered, multistep variable selection identified 24 and 25 significant factors associated with 90-day events in HFpEF and HFrEF, respectively. In addition to risk factors common to both groups, factors unique to HFpEF patients included cognitive dysfunction, low-pulse pressure, beta-blocker, and diuretic use, and right ventricular dysfunction. In contrast, factors unique to HFrEF patients included a history of arrhythmia, acute HF on presentation, and echocardiographic characteristics like left atrial dilatation or elevated mitral E/A ratio. Furthermore, the model tailored to HFpEF (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.770; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.767-0.774) outperformed a model for the combined groups (AUC = 0.759; 95% CI 0.756-0.763). Conclusion The UF 90-day post-discharge acute HF Re admission or Death Risk Assessment (UF90-RADRA) models help identify HFpEF and HFrEF patients at higher risk who may require proactive outpatient management.

ID NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTERISTICS; DEVIANT-BEHAVIOR; CIGARETTE; CONTEXT; ME
AB The main purpose of this study is to test the validity and cross-cultural generalizability of Akers' Social Structure and Social Learning (SSSL) model of crime and deviance. The test is done with data on substance use behavior among adolescents in South Korea utilizing a sample of 1,021 high school students. The data are taken from (1) a self-report survey of 1,021 high school students in Busan, South Korea and (2) district (Gu) level census reports of Busan. We consider this a test of the full SSSL model because we have at least one measure of all of the four main explanatory concepts found in social learning theory (differential association, definition, differential reinforcement, and imitation) and of all four of the social structural components of SSSL (differential social organization, differential location in the social structure, theoretically defined structural causes of crime, and differential social location in groups). The principal hypothesis is that the effects of the measures of social structure on adolescent deviance (substance use) will be substantially mediated by the measures of the social learning variables. To test this hypothesis multi-level data are analyzed in several Hierarchal Linear Models. The social learning variables are found to substantially mediate the effects of social structural components on adolescents' alcohol use. Therefore, the study provides additional evidence supportive of SSSL and evidence that it applies not only in the United States but also is generalizable to a non-Western society. The contributions, limitations, and implications of the study for future research are presented.

AB Statistical relational learning (SRL) is a subarea in machine learning which addresses the problem of performing statistical inference on data that is correlated and not independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.)-as is generally assumed. For the traditional i.i.d. setting, distribution-free bounds exist, such as the Hoeffding bound, which are used to provide confidence bounds on the generalization error of a classification algorithm given its hold-out error on a sample size of N. Bounds of this form are currently not present for the type of interactions that are considered in the data by relational classification algorithms. In this paper, we extend the Hoeffding bounds to the relational setting. In particular, we derive distribution-free bounds for certain classes of data generation models that do not produce i.i.d. data and are based on the type of interactions that are considered by relational classification algorithms that have been developed in SRL. We conduct empirical studies on synthetic and real data which show that these data generation models are indeed realistic and the derived bounds are tight enough for practical use.

AB We tested whether the current understanding of insignificant effect of drainage on evapotranspiration (ET) in the temperate region wetlands applies to those in the subtropics. Hydro-climatic drivers causing the changes in drained wetlands were identified and used to develop a generic model to predict wetland ET. Eddy covariance (EC)-based ET measurements were made for two years at two differently drained but close by wetlands, a heavily drained wetland (SW) (97% reduced surface storage) and a more functional wetland (DW) (42% reduced storage). Annual ET for more intensively drained SW was 836 mm, 34% less than DW (1271 mm) and the difference was significant (p = 0.001). This difference was mainly due to drainage driven differences in inundation and associated effects on net radiation (R-n) and local relative humidity. Two generic daily ET models, a regression model (MSE = 0.44 mm(2), R-2 = 0.80) and a machine learning -based Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) model (MSE = 0.36 mm(2), R-2 = 0.84), were developed with the latter being more robust. The RVM model can predict changes in ET for different restoration scenarios; a 1.1 m rise in drainage level showed 7% increase ET (18 mm) at SW while the increase at DW was negligible. The additional ET, 28% of surface flow, can enhance water storage, flood protection, and climate mitigation services at SW compared to DW. More intensely drained wetlands at higher elevation should be targeted for restoration for enhanced storage through increased ET. The models developed can predict changes in ET for improved evaluation of basin-scale effects of restoration programs and climate change scenarios. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Strawberries are an important and high-value crop in the United States. The total value of strawberry production in the United States was $3.42 billion in 2021. However, a major pest of strawberries, two-spotted spider mites (TSSM) (Tetranychus urticae Koch), can cause severe economic losses due to mites feeding on chlorophyll which interferes with photosynthesis. Predatory mites (Neoseiulus californicus and Phytoseiulus persimilis) can control TSSM populations and provide an alternative to conventional pesticides. Predatory mites are more friendly to the environment than pesticides. To monitor TSSM and predatory mite populations in the field, frequent sampling is required. However, manual counting of mites using a hand lens is challenging for a large field. Therefore, this study applied deep learning models to detect TSSM and predatory mites in strawberries from smartphone images. Three different smartphones (Motorola Moto E5 Play, OnePlus A5000, and iPhone XR) and a 25x macro lens were used to collect a total of 3,013 images, including 1,779 TSSM images and 1,234 predatory mite images. TSSM images were collected by the three smartphones, and only the OnePlus A5000 and iPhone XR were used to collect predatory mite images that only contained predatory mites or contained both predatory mites and TSSM in the same image. TSSM images were used to compare two deep learning models (YOLOv4 and Faster R-CNN Resnet50) and three different smartphone cameras. This study found that the average detection accuracy of YOLOv4 and Faster R-CNN was 0.935 and 0.863, respectively. Deep learning models achieved the best detection accuracy on the image collected by iPhone XR. The YOLOv4 model was trained to compare the detection performance of three different input image sizes (160 x 160, 320 x 320, 640 x 640 pixels) for TSSM and predatory mite detection. This study found that the mean average precision of the YOLOv4 increased as the image size increased, and the model trained with an image size of 640 x 640 pixels achieved the detection accuracy of 0.933 for TSSM and predatory mites. This study also found that the YOLOv4 could detect pests under different field illumination conditions. The smartphone image-based method can detect the TSSM and predatory mites quickly from images and with high detection accuracy, which can help growers use less time to monitor mite populations in the field.

AB The minimum error entropy (MEE) criterion has been successfully used in fields such as parameter estimation, system identification and the supervised machine learning. There is in general no explicit expression for the optimal MEE estimate unless some constraints on the conditional distribution are imposed. A recent paper has proved that if the conditional density is conditionally symmetric and unimodal (CSUM), then the optimal MEE estimate (with Shannon entropy) equals the conditional median. In this study, we extend this result to the generalized MEE estimation where the optimality criterion is the Renyi entropy or equivalently, the alpha-order information potential (IP).

Also less well known is the extent to which he was an interdisciplinary environmental studies scholar, struggling to understand what promotes and hinders proenvironmental behaviors. In this regard, his life and that of many other conservation scientists provide important clues, but no easy answers. By attempting to integrate the humanities, with its quest for a meaningful and fulfilling human existence, with naturalistic nature spirituality and ecocentric values, as well as the social and natural sciences, Soule sought to solve the riddle as to why human beings seemed unable to understand, slow, and halt negative anthropogenic environmental change. He thus modeled what interdisciplinary environmental studies is at its best. Those advocating the conservation of biological diversity have much to learn from Michael Soule, not only from his scientific findings but also from his way of seeing, the questions he asked, and his love of the living world.

AB Background. Many risk-prediction models for lung transplantation are centered on recipient characteristics and do not account for impact of donor and transplant-related factors or only examine short-term outcomes (eg, predicted 1-y survival). We sought to develop a comprehensive model guiding recipient-donor matching. Methods. We identified double lung transplant recipients (>= 12 y old) in the United Network for Organ Sharing Registry (2005-2020) to develop a risk scoring tool. Cohort was divided into derivation and validation sets. A total of 42 recipient, donor, and transplant factors were included in the analysis. Lasso method was used for variable selection. Survival was estimated using Cox-proportional hazard models. An interactive web-based tool was developed for clinical use. Results. A derivation cohort (n = 10 660) informed the model with 13-recipient, 4-donor, and 2-transplant variables. Adjusted risk scores were computed for every transplant and grouped into 3 clusters. Model-estimated survival probabilities were similar to the observed in the validation cohort (n = 4464) for all clusters. The mortality increases for medium- and high-risk groups was similar in both derivation and validation cohorts (C statistics for 1-, 5-, and 10-y survival were 0.67, 0.64, and 0.72, respectively). The web-based application estimated 1-, 5-, 10-y survival and half-life for low- (92%, 73%, 52%; 10.5 y), medium- (89%, 62%, 38%; 7.3 y), and high-risk clusters (85%, 52%, 26%; 5.2 y). Conclusions. Advanced methods incorporating machine/deep learning led to a risk scoring model (including recipient, donor, and transplant factors) and a web-based clinical tool providing short- and long-term survival probabilities for recipient-donor matches. This will enable risk-based matching that could improve utilization of and benefit from a limited donor pool.

TI Identification of risk factors of Long COVID and predictive modeling in
   the RECOVER EHR cohorts
SO COMMUNICATIONS MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Background SARS-CoV-2-infected patients may develop new conditions in the period after the acute infection. These conditions, the post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC, or Long COVID), involve a diverse set of organ systems. Limited studies have investigated the predictability of Long COVID development and its associated risk factors. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we used electronic healthcare records from two large-scale PCORnet clinical research networks, INSIGHT (similar to 1.4 million patients from New York) and OneFlorida+ (similar to 0.7 million patients from Florida), to identify factors associated with having Long COVID, and to develop machine learning-based models for predicting Long COVID development. Both SARS-CoV-2-infected and non-infected adults were analysed during the period of March 2020 to November 2021. Factors associated with Long COVID risk were identified by removing background associations and correcting for multiple tests. Results We observed complex association patterns between baseline factors and a variety of Long COVID conditions, and we highlight that severe acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, being underweight, and having baseline comorbidities (e.g., cancer and cirrhosis) are likely associated with increased risk of developing Long COVID. Several Long COVID conditions, e.g., dementia, malnutrition, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, PASC diagnosis U099, and acute kidney failure are well predicted (C-index > 0.8). Moderately predictable conditions include atelectasis, pulmonary embolism, diabetes, pulmonary fibrosis, and thromboembolic disease (C-index 0.7-0.8). Less predictable conditions include fatigue, anxiety, sleep disorders, and depression (C-index around 0.6). Conclusions This observational study suggests that association patterns between investigated factors and Long COVID are complex, and the predictability of different Long COVID conditions varies. However, machine learning-based predictive models can help in identifying patients who are at risk of developing a variety of Long COVID conditions. Plain language summary Most people who develop COVID-19 make a full recovery, but some go on to develop post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection, commonly known as Long COVID. Up to now, we did not know why some people are affected by Long COVID whilst others are not. We conducted a study to identify risk factors for Long COVID and developed a mathematical modeling approach to predict those at risk. We find that Long COVID is associated with some factors such as experiencing severe acute COVID-19, being underweight, and having conditions including cancer or cirrhosis. Due to the wide variety of symptoms defined as Long COVID, it may be challenging to come up with a set of risk factors that can predict the whole spectrum of Long COVID. However, our approach could be used to predict a variety of Long COVID conditions.

   FORCES; MULTIMODELING
AB Automated Planning has been an active research topic for more than thirty years, but only recently has it started to move in the direction of combining planning and execution to achieve what is sometimes called Intelligent Reactive Planning. We propose Simulation-Based planning as a new way to perform intelligent reactive planning. Simulation-Based planning-unlike most other planning systems-integrates simulation into the planning process. Once a set of plans is generated, simulations are used to test and evaluate the plans to choose the most applicable plan for that current situation. In most planning systems, plan evaluation depends on rules alone, and because rules must be designed general enough to cover all possible cases, the evaluation is not specific enough for some individual cases. However, when the plan evaluation is done through simulations, the evaluation can be more fine-tuned to individual cases and can better allow better plans to be chosen for that individual case. From the military planning perspective, the simulation-based planner is also quite useful due to its ability to perform adversarial and multi-agent planning. This is a natural consequence of using simulation in the planning process. By allowing other entities such as the enemy to simulate in parallel with the planner's forces, the planner is able to observe, prior to the actual execution, the effects of adversarial and multi-agent actions against its own plans.

AB Marker-assisted selection (MAS) has been widely used in the last few decades in plant breeding programs for the mapping and introgression of genes for economically important traits, which has enabled the development of a number of superior cultivars in different crops. In sugarcane, which is the most important source for sugar and bioethanol, marker development work was initiated long ago; however, marker-assisted breeding in sugarcane has been lagging, mainly due to its large complex genome, high levels of polyploidy and heterozygosity, varied number of chromosomes, and use of low/medium-density markers. Genomic selection (GS) is a proven technology in animal breeding and has recently been incorporated in plant breeding programs. GS is a potential tool for the rapid selection of superior genotypes and accelerating breeding cycle. However, its full potential could be realized by an integrated approach combining high-throughput phenotyping, genotyping, machine learning, and speed breeding with genomic selection. For better understanding of GS integration, we comprehensively discuss the concept of genetic gain through the breeder's equation, GS methodology, prediction models, current status of GS in sugarcane, challenges of prediction accuracy, challenges of GS in sugarcane, integrated GS, high-throughput phenotyping (HTP), high-throughput genotyping (HTG), machine learning, and speed breeding followed by its prospective applications in sugarcane improvement.

ID CAUSAL INFERENCE; SELECTION BIAS; REGRESSION; EDUCATION; ALTERNATIVES;
   ADJUSTMENT; MODELS
AB Background:
   The generalized propensity score (GPS) addresses selection bias due to observed confounding variables and provides a means to demonstrate causality of continuous treatment doses with propensity score analyses. Estimating the GPS with parametric models obliges researchers to meet improbable conditions such as correct model specification, normal distribution of variables, and large sample sizes.
   Objectives:
   The purpose of this Monte Carlo simulation study is to examine the performance of neural networks as compared to full factorial regression models to estimate GPS in the presence of Gaussian and skewed treatment doses and small to moderate sample sizes.
   Research design:
   A detailed conceptual introduction of neural networks is provided, as well as an illustration of selection of hyperparameters to estimate GPS. An example from public health and nutrition literature uses residential distance as a treatment variable to illustrate how neural networks can be used in a propensity score analysis to estimate a dose-response function of grocery spending behaviors.
   Results:
   We found substantially higher correlations and lower mean squared error values after comparing true GPS with the scores estimated by neural networks. The implication is that more selection bias was removed using GPS estimated with neural networks than using GPS estimated with classical regression.
   Conclusions:
   This study proposes a new methodological procedure, neural networks, to estimate GPS. Neural networks are not sensitive to the assumptions of linear regression and other parametric models and have been shown to be a contender against parametric approaches to estimate propensity scores for continuous treatments.

AB The overall objective of this work was to develop and evaluate computer vision and machine learning technique for classification of Huanglongbing-(HLB)-infected and healthy leaves using fluorescence imaging spectroscopy. The fluorescence images were segmented using normalized graph cut, and texture features were extracted from the segmented images using cooccurrence matrix. The extracted features were used as an input into the classifier, support vector machine (SVM). The classification results were evaluated based on classification accuracies and number of false positives and false negatives. The results indicated that the SVM could classify HLB-infected leaf fluorescence intensities with up to 90% classification accuracy. Though the fluorescence intensities from leaves collected in Brazil and the USA were different, the method shows potential for detecting HLB.

AB Agricultural expansion and intensification are major drivers of global biodiversity loss, endangering natural habitats and ecosystem functions, such as pollination. In this study, we analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of avocado frontier expansion and intensification from 2011 to 2019 and assess their effects on landscape connectivity, focusing on Michoac & aacute;n, Mexico, the world's leading avocado exporter. Using high-resolution satellite imagery combined with deep learning based on convolutional neural networks, we delineated avocado orchards and other land use/cover classes, mapped individual avocado tree crowns and irrigation ponds, and identified hotspots of expanding and intensifying avocado production. We used a circuit theory approach to evaluate the effects of avocado expansion and intensification on the connectivity of natural and semi-natural habitats. Our results reveal a rapid increase in avocado orchards, which expanded by 4175 ha-a growth from 27.9% to 37% in area-over the eight-year period. There was also a decline in rainfed agriculture by 3252 ha, and oak-pine forests by 1343 ha. We observed not only the expansion of the avocado frontier into forests but also an intensification of avocado production via increases in high-density plantations, irrigation ponds, and orchards prone to intensive pruning. Moreover, lower-intensity land-use classes, such as rainfed crops, were rapidly converted to avocado orchards. This expansion and intensification have led to increasing isolation of forest fragments. Although we identified routes that could facilitate the movement of species, the dense avocado monocultures continue to threaten the connectivity of natural and semi-natural habitats, causing notable losses of old-growth oak-pine forests and disrupting crucial ecological corridors. Our research underscores the adverse effects of avocado production on land use and landscape connectivity, emphasizing the need for sustainable management practices to ensure the long-term viability of avocado production systems and overall ecosystem functioning

AB Post marketing data offer rich information and cost-effective resources for physicians and policy-makers to address some critical scientific questions in clinical practice. However, the complex confounding structures (e.g., nonlinear and nonadditive interactions) embedded in these observational data often pose major analytical challenges for proper analysis to draw valid conclusions. Furthermore, often made available as electronic health records (EHRs), these data are usually massive with hundreds of thousands observational records, which introduce additional computational challenges. In this paper, for comparative effectiveness analysis, we propose a statistically robust yet computationally efficient propensity score (PS) approach to adjust for the complex confounding structures. Specifically, we propose a kernel-based machine learning method for flexibly and robustly PS modeling to obtain valid PS estimation from observational data with complex confounding structures. The estimated propensity score is then used in the second stage analysis to obtain the consistent average treatment effect estimate. An empirical variance estimator based on the bootstrap is adopted. A split-and-merge algorithm is further developed to reduce the computational workload of the proposed method for big data, and to obtain a valid variance estimator of the average treatment effect estimate as a by-product. As shown by extensive numerical studies and an application to postoperative pain EHR data comparative effectiveness analysis, the proposed approach consistently outperforms other competing methods, demonstrating its practical utility.

AB Neonatal calf diarrhea (NCD) remains a significant contributor to calf mortality within the first 3 weeks of life, prompting widespread antibiotic use with associated concerns about antimicrobial resistance and disruption of the calf gut microbiota. Recent research exploring NCD treatments targeting gut microbiota dysbiosis has highlighted probiotic supplementation as a promising and safe strategy for gut homeostasis. However, varying treatment outcomes across studies suggest the need for efficient treatment options. In this study, we evaluated the potential of probiotics Limosilactobacillus reuteri, formally known as Lactobacillus reuteri, isolated from healthy neonatal calves to treat NCD. Through in silico whole genome analysis and in vitro assays, we identified nine L. reuteri strains, which were then administered to calves with NCD. Calves treated with L. reuteri strains shed healthy feces and demonstrated restored gut microbiota and normal animal behavior. Leveraging a machine learning model, we evaluated microbiota profiles and identified bacterial taxa associated with calf gut health that were elevated by L. reuteri administration. These findings represent a crucial advancement towards sustainable antibiotic alternatives for managing NCD, contributing significantly to global efforts in mitigating antimicrobial resistance and promoting overall animal health and welfare.

ID ALGORITHM
AB An updated version of the Profile Front Minimization (PFM) nodal renumbering algorithm is presented. The new version includes an artificial neural network application that enables greatly improved profile and wavefront characteristics. The algorithm is compared to other commonly used algorithms. The comparisons are based on a set of standard test problems proposed by Everstine. The results indicate that, in most cases, PFM produces better profile and wavefront values than other methods. In addition, the algorithm is efficient in terms of storage requirements and code size, making it easy to implement in existing finite element codes.

AB Detection and monitoring invasive species can provide valuable ecological information to guide management decisions. Multispectral imagery remote sensing may be an ideal tool to address this problem by providing ac-curate and affordable repeat imagery. However, developing training datasets for remote sensing imagery can be riddled with issues such as matching a training site to a single pixel in target imagery or mixed pixels caused by low invader densities. The multitarget multiple-instance spectral match filter (MTMI-SMF) algorithm accounts for such errors and has low computation costs. Here, we evaluated MTMI-SMF for invasive species detection with National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP), RapidEye, and Landsat imagery using Brazilian peppertree (Schinus terebinthifolia) in the Everglades National Park as a case study. MTMI-SMF detected Brazilian peppertree with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85 for Landsat, 0.82 for RapidEye, and 0.71 NAIP imagery. Invader classification was developed using a threshold calculated from MTMI-SMF image detection confidence values and compared to a random forest classification. MTMI-SMF and random forest classifications had similar overall accuracies with NAIP imagery performing the lowest (an average of 73.6% and 88.9%, respectively) and Landsat performing the highest (an average of 90.9% and 91.4%, respectively). However, due to the relatively rare nature of Brazilian peppertree across this landscape, the overall classification accuracy was not fully representative of detection capabilities. MTMI-SMF outperformed random forest for user accuracy and had comparable producer accuarcy across all three image sources. Classifications primarily relied on the brighter signature of Brazilian peppertree due to the limited number of spectral bands in the multispectral imagery. As a result, confusion was caused by heterogeneous vegetation communities or shrub habitats, which most likely could be resolved with the increased availability of satellite hyperspectral datasets. Our study indicates that MTMI-SMF, a machine-learning approach that allows flexibility in training data, can detect highly problematic invaders using multispectral imagery. This pipeline could be readily adapted to other invaders and ecosystems, as well as different remote sensing image sources, and has low computational requirements. Our study demon-strates that remote sensing technologies and multiple-instance learning algorithms can provide managers with critical tools for tackling the ever-growing, costly, and challenging problem of tracking invasive species' plant spread.

AB In recent years, climate change patterns and extreme weather events have adversely affected agricultural production and have raised concerns about its effect on crop yields. These changes can affect the crop yield in many ways including the changes in the length of the growing season, planting and harvest time windows, precipitation amount and frequency, and the growing degree days, etc. So, it is important to analyze the effect of climate change on yield variability for a better understanding of its effect on the crops. This study aims to analyze the historical monthly county-level data for the state of Ohio to quantify maize (Zea mays) and soybean (Glycine max) yield temporal variability and to study the impact of proposed climate change scenarios on the yield. Machine learning algorithms were used to model the effect of monthly temperature and precipitation levels on yield variability, and to study the effect of climate change scenarios on yield. In addition, yield prediction models were integrated with proposed climate change scenarios for higher and lower emissions scenarios to predict the maize and soybean yield for the year 2100. To model the effect of weather parameters on temporal yield variability, the Random Forest model outperformed with RMSE of 0.61 Mt/ha and R2 of 0.73 for maize and with RMSE of 0.21 Mt/ha, R2 of 0.64 for soybean crop. Maximum temperature for July which has a negative correlation with yield was found to be the most dominant parameter for maize yield followed by the precipitation in August, July, and June which have a positive correlation with maize yield. Precipitation in August was found to be the most dominant weather parameter for soybean yield followed by maximum temperature in July. Based on the projected average increase in Ohio's temperature and precipitation levels alone, maize yield was predicted to drop by 13.2% or 18.5% respectively due to lower emissions and higher emissions climate change scenario of Ohio. Similarly, a 6.64% and a 9.63% drop is expected in the soybean yield by the year 2100 for both lower emissions and higher emissions climate change scenarios. In economic terms based on current commodity values, this is an astounding loss of 254.7 to 369.7 million USD for maize and 535.9 - 751.1 million USD for soybean crop to the state of Ohio.

AB Hospital readmission refers to the situation where a patient is re-hospitalized with the same primary diagnosis within a specific time interval after discharge. Hospital readmission causes $26 billion preventable expenses to the U.S. health systems annually and often indicates suboptimal patient care. To alleviate those severe financial and health consequences, it is crucial to proactively predict patients' readmission risk. Such prediction is challenging because the evolution of patients' medical history is dynamic and complex. The state-of-the-art studies apply statistical models which use static predictors in a period, failing to consider patients' heterogeneous medical history. Our approach - Trajectory-BAsed DEep Learning (TADEL) - is motivated to tackle the deficiencies of the existing approaches by capturing dynamic medical history. We evaluate TADEL on a five-year national Medicare claims dataset including 3.6 million patients per year over all hospitals in the United States, reaching an F1 score of 87.3% and an AUC of 88.4%. Our approach significantly outperforms all the state-of-the-art methods. Our findings suggest that health status factors and insurance coverage are important predictors for readmission. This study contributes to IS literature and analytical methodology by formulating the trajectory-based readmission prediction problem and developing a novel deep-learning-based readmission risk prediction framework. From a health IT perspective, this research delivers implementable methods to assess patients' readmission risk and take early interventions to avoid potential negative consequences.

AB Transit spectroscopy is a powerful tool for decoding the chemical compositions of the atmospheres of extrasolar planets. In this paper, we focus on unsupervised techniques for analyzing spectral data from transiting exoplanets. After cleaning and validating the data, we demonstrate methods for: (i) initial exploratory data analysis, based on summary statistics (estimates of location and variability); (ii) exploring and quantifying the existing correlations in the data; (iii) preprocessing and linearly transforming the data to its principal components; (iv) dimensionality reduction and manifold learning; (v) clustering and anomaly detection; and (vi) visualization and interpretation of the data. To illustrate the proposed unsupervised methodology, we use a well-known public benchmark data set of synthetic transit spectra. We show that there is a high degree of correlation in the spectral data, which calls for appropriate low-dimensional representations. We explore a number of different techniques for such dimensionality reduction and identify several suitable options in terms of summary statistics, principal components, etc. We uncover interesting structures in the principal component basis, namely well-defined branches corresponding to different chemical regimes of the underlying atmospheres. We demonstrate that those branches can be successfully recovered with a K-means clustering algorithm in a fully unsupervised fashion. We advocate for lower-dimensional representations of the spectroscopic data in terms of the main principal components, in order to reveal the existing structure in the data and quickly characterize the chemical class of a planet.

AB Y2TiO5 belongs to the Ln2TiO5 (Ln = lanthanide or Y) family of ceramic materials and exhibits a range of desirable material properties such as radiation tolerance, frustrated magnetism, and large dielectric constant. However, understanding the complex crystal structure of Y2TiO5 remains elusive, given that Y2TiO5 can adopt multiple polymorphs such as cubic, orthorhombic, and hexagonal phases within the lattice. In this work, we report a detailed structural analysis of Y2TiO5 using four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy coupled with unsupervised machine learning. The pyrochlore nanodomains, characterized by the ordered arrangement of yttrium cations on the A site of their A2BO5 structure, are present within the matrix of a predominantly fluorite-structured Y2TiO5 along with a third polymorph, the hexagonal phase. The pyrochlore phase is found to form 2 nm boundary regions around hexagonal phase stacking faults, highlighting the potential influence of the hexagonal phase on the occurrence and distribution of the pyrochlore phase. Lastly, we identify a unique pyrochlore phase with asymmetric arrangement of cation ordering along a single planar direction. Our findings provide invaluable insights into the possible mechanisms stabilizing pyrochlore nanodomains within the fluorite lattice of Y2TiO5.

AB Predicting the diffusion coefficient of fluids under nanoconfinement is important for many applications including the extraction of shale gas from kerogen and product turnover in porous catalysts. Due to the large number of important variables, including pore shape and size, fluid temperature and density, and the fluid-wall interaction strength, simulating diffusion coefficients using molecular dynamics (MD) in a systematic study could prove to be prohibitively expensive. Here, we use machine learning models trained on a subset of MD data to predict the self-diffusion coefficients of Lennard-Jones fluids in pores. Our MD data set contains 2280 simulations of ideal slit pore, cylindrical pore, and hexagonal pore geometries. We use the forward feature selection method to determine the most useful features (i.e., descriptors) for developing an artificial neutral network (ANN) model with an emphasis on easily acquired features. Our model shows good predictive ability with a coefficient of determination (i.e., R2) of -,0.99 and a mean squared error of -,2.9 x 10-5. Finally, we propose an alteration to our feature set that will allow the ANN model to be applied to nonideal pore geometries.

AB Adaptive optimization methods, such as AdaGrad, RMSProp, and Adam, are widely used in solving large-scale machine learning problems. A number of schemes have been proposed in the literature aiming at parallelizing them, based on communications between peripheral nodes with a central node, but incur high communications cost. To address this issue, we develop a novel consensus-based distributed adaptive moment estimation method (DAdam) for online optimization over a decentralized network that enables data parallelization, as well as decentralized computation. The method is particularly useful, since it can accommodate settings where access only to local data is permitted. Further, as established theoretically in this work, it can outperform centralized adaptive algorithms, for certain classes of loss functions used in machine learning applications. We analyze the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate of adaptive moment estimation methods in both online convex and non-convex settings. Empirical results demonstrate that DAdam exhibits also good performance in practice and compares favorably to competing online optimization methods.

ID SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; CLASSIFICATION; REGRESSION; VALENCE
AB We present explainable machine learning approaches for the accurate prediction and understanding of solvation free energies, enthalpies, and entropies for different salts in various protic and aprotic solvents. As key input features, we use fundamental contributions from the conceptual density functional theory (DFT) of solutions. The most accurate models with the highest prediction accuracy for the experimental validation data set are decision tree-based approaches such as extreme gradient boosting and extra trees, which highlight the non-linear influence of feature values on target predictions. The detailed assessment of the importance of features in terms of Gini importance criteria as well as Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) and permutation and reduction approaches underlines the prominent role of anion and cation solvation effects in combination with fundamental electronic properties of the solvents. These results are reasonably consistent with previous assumptions and provide a solid rationale for more recent theoretical approaches.

AB The core product of tourism is experience and therefore is inherently emotional in nature. As such, online storytelling has become an essential destination promotion strategy as it effectively conveys information while at the same time builds emotional connections with potential travelers by encouraging imagination and involvement. Understanding and measuring travelers' emotional responses to online stories are essential to developing effective advertising strategies. Traditionally, the self-report approach has been employed whereby informants are asked to identify their emotions. With the development of advanced machine learning techniques, new tools such as sentiment analysis have been developed to detect the emotions conveyed by text. In this study, we summarized the results of a comparative analysis of emotion detection using both self-report method and sentiment analysis. The results show general consistency between the two approaches in terms of overall descriptive statistics as well as the relationships between emotions and various components of advertising response.

AB Single nucleotide exact amplicon sequence variants (ASV) of the human gut microbiome were used to evaluate if individuals with a depression phenotype (DEPR) could be identified from healthy reference subjects (NODEP). Microbial DNA in stool samples obtained from 40 subjects were characterized using high throughput microbiome sequence data processed via DADA2 error correction combined with PIME machine-learning de-noising and taxa binning/parsing of prevalent ASVs at the single nucleotide level of resolution. Application of ALDEx2 differential abundance analysis with assessed effect sizes and stringent PICRUSt2 predicted metabolic pathways. This multivariate machine-learning approach significantly differentiated DEPR (n = 20) vs. NODEP (n = 20) (PERMANOVA P < 0.001) based on microbiome taxa clustering and neurocircuit-relevant metabolic pathway network analysis for GABA, butyrate, glutamate, monoamines, monosaturated fatty acids, and inflammasome components. Gut microbiome dysbiosis using ASV prevalence data may offer the diagnostic potential of using human metaorganism biomarkers to identify individuals with a depression phenotype.

AB Unlike traditional supervised classification, complementary label learning (CLL) operates under a weak supervision framework, where each sample is annotated by excluding several incorrect labels, known as complementary labels (CLs). Despite reducing the labeling burden, CLL always suffers a decline in performance due to the weakened supervised information. To overcome such limitations, in this study, a multi-view fusion and self-adaptive label discovery based CLL method (MVSLDCLL) is proposed. The self-adaptive label discovery strategy leverages graph-based semi-supervised learning to capture the label distribution of each training sample as a convex combination of all its potential labels. The multi-view fusion module is designed to adapt to various views of feature representations. In specific, it minimizes the discrepancies of label projections between pairwise views, aligning with the consensus principle. Additionally, a straightforward mechanism inspired by a teamwork analogy is proposed to incorporate view-discrepancy for each sample. Experimental results demonstrate that MVSLDCLL learns more discriminative label distribution and achieves significantly higher accuracies compared to state-of-the-art CLL methods. Ablation study has also been performed to validate the effectiveness of both the self-adaptive label discovery strategy and the multi-view fusion module.

DE SARS-CoV-2 (sub)lineages; deep learning; anomaly detection; spike

AB The COVID-19 pandemic is marked by the successive emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 variants, lineages, and sublineages that outcompete earlier strains, largely due to factors like increased transmissibility and immune escape. We propose DeepAutoCoV, an unsupervised deep learning anomaly detection system, to predict future dominant lineages (FDLs). We define FDLs as viral (sub)lineages that will constitute >10% of all the viral sequences added to the GISAID, a public database supporting viral genetic sequence sharing, in a given week. DeepAutoCoV is trained and validated by assembling global and country-specific data sets from over 16 million Spike protein sequences sampled over a period of 4 years. DeepAutoCoV successfully flags FDLs at very low frequencies (0.01%-3%), with median lead times of 4-17 weeks, and predicts FDLs between 5 and 25 times better than a baseline approach. For example, the B.1.617.2 vaccine reference strain was flagged as FDL when its frequency was only 0.01%, more than a year before it was considered for an updated COVID-19 vaccine. Furthermore, DeepAutoCoV outputs interpretable results by pinpointing specific mutations potentially linked to increased fitness and may provide significant insights for the optimization of public health 'pre-emptive' intervention strategies.

TI DeepDynaForecast: Phylogenetic-informed graph deep learning for
   epidemic transmission dynamic prediction
SO PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB In the midst of an outbreak or sustained epidemic, reliable prediction of transmission risks and patterns of spread is critical to inform public health programs. Projections of transmission growth or decline among specific risk groups can aid in optimizing interventions, particularly when resources are limited. Phylogenetic trees have been widely used in the detection of transmission chains and high-risk populations. Moreover, tree topology and the incorporation of population parameters (phylodynamics) can be useful in reconstructing the evolutionary dynamics of an epidemic across space and time among individuals. We now demonstrate the utility of phylodynamic trees for transmission modeling and forecasting, developing a phylogeny-based deep learning system, referred to as DeepDynaForecast. Our approach leverages a primal-dual graph learning structure with shortcut multi-layer aggregation, which is suited for the early identification and prediction of transmission dynamics in emerging high-risk groups. We demonstrate the accuracy of DeepDynaForecast using simulated outbreak data and the utility of the learned model using empirical, large-scale data from the human immunodeficiency virus epidemic in Florida between 2012 and 2020. Our framework is available as open-source software (MIT license) at github.com/lab-smile/DeepDynaForcast.

AB Tourism is one of the sectors of the economy that is most dependent on climate, creating multiple vulnerabilities and new opportunities arising with changing climate. Even though the links between tourism and climate have been well researched, this scientific knowledge has not percolated into policies and the ability to act. This disconnect between scientific knowledge and practices is frequently blamed on inadequate climate change communication to the public in mass media. We studied the mass media framing of climate change and tourism by analyzing English newspaper publications worldwide over the past 30 years. The paper presents a Big Data analysis of the content, geographical patterns, and temporal changes in newspapers' publications on climate change and tourism.

AB Learning induces dynamic changes to the actin cytoskeleton that are required to support memory formation. However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate filamentous actin (F-actin) dynamics during learning and memory are poorly understood. Myosin II motors are highly expressed in actin-rich growth structures including dendritic spines, and we have recently shown that these molecular machines mobilize F-actin in response to synaptic stimulation and learning in the hippocampus. In this study, we report that Myosin II motors in the rat lateral amygdala (LA) are essential for fear memory formation. Pretraining infusions of the Myosin II inhibitor, blebbistatin (blebb), disrupted long term memory, while short term memory was unaffected. Interestingly, both post-training and pretesting infusions had no effect on memory formation, indicating that Myosin II motors operate during or shortly after learning to promote memory consolidation. These data support the idea that Myosin II motor-force generation is a general mechanism that supports memory consolidation in the mammalian CNS.

AB To improve the accuracy of cherry fruit recognition during picking operations and to enable automated cherry picking by robots, both original and complex sample image sets were collected at the orchard site in two phases. Concurrently, the basic data set, enhanced data set, and task data set were generated, wherein the recognition targets were all mature cherry fruits and the recognition targets were cherry fruits that became within the current operation range. First, the basic and enhanced data sets were used for comparative training on you only look once (YOLO) v3. The test results demonstrated that the ability of YOLO v3 to recognize occluded and overlapping cherry fruits can be greatly enhanced by increasing the quantity and percentage of samples in the training set that have high levels of occlusion and overlap. Second, the enhanced data set was used to train the Faster R-CNN, SSD, YOLO v3, and YOLO v5 networks. The test results indicated that YOLO v5 had the best recognition effect on mature cherries. Next, the enhanced data set and the task data set were used to train YOLO v5. Experiments revealed that YOLO v5 was more successful in identifying cherry fruits that needed to be picked within the current task range, while shielding mature cherries that should not be picked outside of it. 96% of the data was precise, and 99% of the data was recall.

AB Primary objective: To determine the relative uses of neural action potential ('spike') data versus local field potentials (LFPs) for modeling information flow through complex brain networks. Hypothesis: The common use of LFP data, which are continuous and therefore more mathematically suited for spectral information-flow modeling techniques such as Granger causality analysis, can lead to spurious inferences about whether a given brain area 'drives' the spiking in a downstream area. Experiment: We recorded spikes and LFPs from the forelimb motor cortex (M1) and the magnocellular red nucleus (mRN), which receives axon collaterals from M1 projection cells onto its distal dendrites, but not onto its perisomatic regions, as rats performed a skilled reaching task. Results and implications: As predicted, Granger causality analysis on the LFPs-which are mainly composed of vector-summed dendritic currents-produced results that if conventionally interpreted would suggest that the M1 cells drove spike firing in the mRN, whereas analyses of spiking in the two recorded regions revealed no significant correlations. These results suggest that mathematical models of information flow should treat the sampled dendritic activity as more likely to reflect intrinsic dendritic and input-related processing in neural networks, whereas spikes are more likely to provide information about the output of neural network processing.

AB Background There has been increasing interest in online professional learning networks in a variety of social media platforms, especially in Twitter. Twitter offers immediacy, personalization, and support of networks to increase professional knowledge and the sense of membership. Knowing the topics discussed in Twitter and the factors that affect the duration of a topic would help to sustain and reconstruct Twitter-based professional learning activities. Objectives The purpose of this study is to analyse the topics discussed and what factors affect the duration of a specific topic in 6 years within a virtual professional learning network (VPLN) using #Edchat in Twitter, based on media richness features. Methods Internet-mediated research and digital methods are used for data collection and analysis. Various text, natural language processing, and machine learning algorithms were used along with the quantitative multilevel models. This study examined 504,998 tweets posted by 72,342 unique users by using #Edchat. Results There were 150 topics discussed over the 6 years and multilevel random intercept regression model revealed that a specific topic discussed in the #Edchat VPLN is discussed longer when it has more tweets, rather than retweets, posted by a high number of different users along with moderate text, high or moderate mentions with more hashtags. Takeaways The study developed an automated social media richness feature extraction framework that can be adapted for other theoretical applications in educational context. Emergent topics discussed in Twitter among #Edchat VPLN members for professional development were identified. It extends the social media richness theory for educational context and explore factors that affect an online professional learning activity in Twitter.

AB Traditional methods for assessing illness severity and predicting in-hospital mortality among critically ill patients require time-consuming, error-prone calculations using static variable thresholds. These methods do not capitalize on the emerging availability of streaming electronic health record data or capture time-sensitive individual physiological patterns, a critical task in the intensive care unit. We propose a novel acuity score framework (DeepSOFA) that leverages temporal measurements and interpretable deep learning models to assess illness severity at any point during an ICU stay. We compare DeepSOFA with SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) baseline models using the same model inputs and find that at any point during an ICU admission, DeepSOFA yields significantly more accurate predictions of in-hospital mortality. A DeepSOFA model developed in a public database and validated in a single institutional cohort had a mean AUC for the entire ICU stay of 0.90 (95% CI 0.90-0.91) compared with baseline SOFA models with mean AUC 0.79 (95% CI 0.79-0.80) and 0.85 (95% CI 0.85-0.86). Deep models are well-suited to identify ICU patients in need of life-saving interventions prior to the occurrence of an unexpected adverse event and inform shared decision-making processes among patients, providers, and families regarding goals of care and optimal resource utilization.

AB Objectives: Despite the increasing interest in applying machine learning (ML) methods in health economics and outcomes research (HEOR), stakeholders face uncertainties in when and how ML can be used. We reviewed the recent applications of ML in HEOR.Methods: We searched PubMed for studies published between January 2020 and March 2021 and randomly chose 20% of the identified studies for the sake of manageability. Studies that were in HEOR and applied an ML technique were included. Studies related to wearable devices were excluded. We abstracted information on the ML applications, data types, and ML methods and analyzed it using descriptive statistics.Results: We retrieved 805 articles, of which 161 (20%) were randomly chosen. Ninety-two of the random sample met the eligibility criteria. We found that ML was primarily used for predicting future events (86%) rather than current events (14%). The most common response variables were clinical events or disease incidence (42%) and treatment outcomes (22%). ML was less used to predict economic outcomes such as health resource utilization (16%) or costs (3%). Although electronic medical records (35%) were frequently used for model development, claims data were used less frequently (9%). Tree-based methods (eg, random forests and boosting) were the most commonly used ML methods (31%).Conclusions: The use of ML techniques in HEOR is growing rapidly, but there remain opportunities to apply them to predict economic outcomes, especially using claims databases, which could inform the development of cost-effectiveness models.

AB Objectives:With the emerging use of machine learning (ML) techniques, there has been particular interest in using wearable data for health economics and outcomes research (HEOR). We aimed to understand the emerging patterns of how ML has been applied to wearable data in HEOR. Methods:We identified studies published in PubMed between January 2016 and March 2021. Studies that included at least 1 HEOR-related Medical Subject Headings term, applied an ML, and used wearable data were eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers abstracted information including ML application types and data on which ML was applied and analyzed them using descriptive analyses. Results:A total of 148 studies were identified from PubMed, among which 32 studies met the inclusion criteria. There has been an increase over time in the number of ML studies using wearable data. ML has been more frequently used for monitoring events in real time (78%) than to predict future events (22%). There has been a wide range of outcomes examined, ranging from general physical or mental health (24%) to more disease-specific outcomes (eg, disease incidence [19%] and progression [13%]) and treatment-related outcomes (eg, treatment adherence [9%] and outcomes [9%]). Data for ML models were more often derived from wearable devices with specific medical purposes (60%) than those without (40%). Conclusion: There has been a wide range of applications of ML to wearable data. Both medical and nonmedical wearable devices have been used as a data source, showing the potential for providing rich data for ML studies in HEOR.

AB Background: Evaluation of disease severity in Parkinson's disease (PD) relies on motor symptoms quantification. However, during early-stage PD, these symptoms are subtle and difficult to quantify by experts, which might result in delayed diagnosis and suboptimal disease management. Objective: To evaluate the use of videos and machine learning (ML) for automatic quantification of motor symptoms in early-stage PD. Methods: We analyzed videos of three movement tasks-Finger Tapping, Hand Movement, and Leg Agility- from 26 aged-matched healthy controls and 31 early-stage PD patients. Utilizing ML algorithms for pose estimation we extracted kinematic features from these videos and trained three classification models based on left and right- side movements, and right/left symmetry. The models were trained to differentiate healthy controls from early-stage PD from videos. Results: Combining left side, right side, and symmetry features resulted in a PD detection accuracy of 79 % from Finger Tap videos, 75 % from Hand Movement videos, 79 % from Leg Agility videos, and 86 % when combining the three tasks using a soft voting approach. In contrast, the classification accuracy varied between 40 % and 72 % when the movement side or symmetry were not considered. Conclusions: Our methodology effectively differentiated between early-stage PD and healthy controls using videos of standardized motor tasks by integrating kinematic analyses of left-side, right-side, and bilateral symmetry movements. These results demonstrate that ML can detect movement deficits in early-stage PD from videos. This technology is easy-to-use, highly scalable, and has the potential to improve the management and quantification of motor symptoms in early-stage PD.

TI Toward Argument-Based Fairness with an Application to AI-Enhanced

ID SELECTION
AB The field of educational measurement places validity and fairness as central concepts of assessment quality. Prior research has proposed embedding fairness arguments within argument-based validity processes, particularly when fairness is conceived as comparability in assessment properties across groups. However, we argue that a more flexible approach to fairness arguments that occurs outside of and complementary to validity arguments is required to address many of the views on fairness that a set of assessment stakeholders may hold. Accordingly, we focus this manuscript on two contributions: (a) introducing the argument-based fairness approach to complement argument-based validity for both traditional and artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced assessments and (b) applying it in an illustrative AI assessment of perceived hireability in automated video interviews used to prescreen job candidates. We conclude with recommendations for further advancing argument-based fairness approaches.

AB We study the spillover effects of the online reviews of other covisited products on the purchases of a focal product using clickstream data from a large retailer. The proposed spillover effects are moderated by (a) whether the related (covisited) products are complementary or substitutive, (b) the choice of media channel (mobile or personal computer (PC)) used, (c) whether the related products are from the same or a different brand, (d) consumer experience, and (e) the variance of the review ratings. To identify complementary and substitutive products, we develop supervised machine-learning models based on product characteristics, such as product category and brand, and novel text-based similarity measures. We train and validate the machine-learning models using product pair labels from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our results show that the mean rating of substitutive (complementary) products has a negative (positive) effect on purchasing of the focal product. Interestingly, the magnitude of the spillover effects of the mean ratings of covisited (substitutive and complementary) products is significantly larger than the effects on the focal product, especially for complementary products. The spillover effect of ratings is stronger for consumers who use mobile devices versus PCs. We find the negative effect of the mean ratings of substitutive products across different brands on purchasing of a focal product to be significantly higher than within the same brand. Lastly, the effect of the mean ratings is stronger for less experienced consumers and for ratings with lower variance. We discuss implications on leveraging the spillover effect of the online product reviews of related products to encourage online purchases.

AB Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are the most common intensive care unit (ICU) infections. We aimed to evaluate the association of early and cumulative beta-lactam pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) parameters with therapy outcomes in pneumonia. Adult ICU patients who received cefepime, meropenem, or piperacillin-tazobactam for HAP or VAP and had its concentration measured were included. Beta-lactam exposure was generated for every patient for the entire duration of therapy, and the time free concentration remained above the MIC (fT(>MIC)) and the time free concentration remained above four multiples of the MIC (fT(>4xMIC)) were calculated for time frames of 0 to 24 h, 0 to 10 days, and day 0 to end of therapy. Regression analyses and machine learning were performed to evaluate the impact of PK/PD on therapy outcomes. A total of 735 patients and 840 HAP/VAP episodes (47% HAP) were included. The mean age was 56 years, and the mean weight was 80 kg. Sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA), hemodialysis, age, and weight were significantly associated with the clinical outcomes and kept in the final model. In the full cohort including all pneumonia episodes, PK/PD parameters at different time windows were associated with a favorable composite outcome, clinical cure, and mechanical ventilation (MV)-free days. In patients who had positive cultures and reported MICs, almost all PK/PD parameters were significant predictors of therapy outcomes. In the machine learning analysis, PK/PD parameters ranked high and were the primary overall predictors of clinical cure. Early target attainment and cumulative target attainment have a great impact on pneumonia outcomes. Beta-lactam exposure should be optimized early and maintained through therapy duration.

AB Informative contributions are critical for the healthy development of online Q&A communities, which have gained increasing popularity in solving personalized open-ended problems. However, little is known about whether past contribution behaviors and corresponding community feedbacks received affect the characteristics of subsequent contributions. Drawing upon the social cognitive theory, we examine the learning effects on users' knowledge contribution behaviors. Specifically, we focus on two types of learning effects: enactive learning from one's past contribution experience and vicarious learning from observation of others' performances in a question thread. Using a dataset collected from one of the largest online Q&A communities in China, we find that the length feature of past user contributions that garner highly positive feedback, no matter through enactive or vicarious learning, would influence the informativeness of subsequent contributions in the community. These learning effects are more effective for users with higher social status. The enactive learning effect is stronger for contributors with higher social status. For the vicarious learning on higher-status contributors, the influence of high-vote long answers is stronger, but the high-vote short answers show a weaker effect. Our research provides a deeper understanding of knowledge contribution behaviors in online knowledge communities and guides for establishing a healthy knowledge contribution environment.

AB Background
   Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication after surgery that is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The majority of existing perioperative AKI risk prediction models are limited in their generalizability and do not fully utilize intraoperative physiological time-series data. Thus, there is a need for intelligent, accurate, and robust systems to leverage new information as it becomes available to predict the risk of developing postoperative AKI.
   Methods
   A retrospective single-center cohort of 2,911 adults who underwent surgery at the University of Florida Health between 2000 and 2010 was utilized for this study. Machine learning and statistical analysis techniques were used to develop perioperative models to predict the risk of developing AKI during the first three days after surgery, first seven days after surgery, and overall (after surgery during the index hospitalization). The improvement in risk prediction was examined by incorporating intraoperative physiological time-series variables. Our proposed model enriched a preoperative model that produced a probabilistic AKI risk score by integrating intraoperative statistical features through a machine learning stacking approach inside a random forest classifier. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, and Net Reclassification Improvement (NRI).
   Results
   The predictive performance of the proposed model is better than the preoperative data only model. The proposed model had an AUC of 0.86 (accuracy of 0.78) for the seven-day AKI outcome, while the preoperative model had an AUC of 0.84 (accuracy of 0.76). Furthermore, by integrating intraoperative features, the algorithm was able to reclassify 40% of the false negative patients from the preoperative model. The NRI for each outcome was AKI at three days (8%), seven days (7%), and overall (4%).
   Conclusions
   Postoperative AKI prediction was improved with high sensitivity and specificity through a machine learning approach that dynamically incorporated intraoperative data.

AB Background: Wearable accelerometers have greatly improved measurement of physical activity, and the increasing popularity of smartwatches with inherent acceleration data collection suggest their potential use in the physical activity research domain; however, their use needs to be validated.
   Objective: This study aimed to assess the validity of accelerometer data collected from a Samsung Gear S smartwatch (SGS) compared with an ActiGraph GT3X+ (GT3X+) activity monitor. The study aims were to (1) assess SGS validity using a mechanical shaker; (2) assess SGS validity using a treadmill running test; and (3) compare individual activity recognition, location of major body movement detection, activity intensity detection, locomotion recognition, and metabolic equivalent scores (METs) estimation between the SGS and GT3X+.
   Methods: To validate and compare the SGS accelerometer data with GT3X+ data, we collected data simultaneously from both devices during highly controlled, mechanically simulated, and less-controlled natural wear conditions. First, SGS and GT3X+ data were simultaneously collected from a mechanical shaker and an individual ambulating on a treadmill. Pearson correlation was calculated for mechanical shaker and treadmill experiments. Finally, SGS and GT3X+ data were simultaneously collected during 15 common daily activities performed by 40 participants (n=12 males, mean age 55.15 [SD 17.8] years). A total of 15 frequency- and time-domain features were extracted from SGS and GT3X+ data. We used these features for training machine learning models on 6 tasks: (1) individual activity recognition, (2) activity intensity detection, (3) locomotion recognition, (4) sedentary activity detection, (5) major body movement location detection, and (6) METs estimation. The classification models included random forest, support vector machines, neural networks, and decision trees. The results were compared between devices. We evaluated the effect of different feature extraction window lengths on model accuracy as defined by the percentage of correct classifications. In addition to these classification tasks, we also used the extracted features for METs estimation.
   Results: The results were compared between devices. Accelerometer data from SGS were highly correlated with the accelerometer data from GT3X+ for all 3 axes, with a correlation >=.89 for both the shaker test and treadmill test and >=.70 for all daily activities, except for computer work. Our results for the classification of activity intensity levels, locomotion, sedentary, major body movement location, and individual activity recognition showed overall accuracies of 0.87, 1.00, 0.98, 0.85, and 0.64, respectively. The results were not significantly different between the SGS and GT3X+. Random forest model was the best model for METs estimation (root mean squared error of .71 and r-squared value of .50).
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that a commercial brand smartwatch can be used in lieu of validated research grade activity monitors for individual activity recognition, major body movement location detection, activity intensity detection, and locomotion detection tasks.

AB Support vector machines (SVM) is one of the well known supervised classes of learning algorithms. Basic SVM models are dealing with the situation where the exact values of the data points are known. This paper studies SVM when the data points are uncertain. With some properties known for the distributions, chance-constrained SVM is used to ensure the small probability of misclassification for the uncertain data. As infinite number of distributions could have the known properties, the robust chance-constrained SVM requires efficient transformations of the chance constraints to make the problem solvable. In this paper, robust chance-constrained SVM with second-order moment information is studied and we obtain equivalent semidefinite programming and second order cone programming reformulations. The geometric interpretation is presented and numerical experiments are conducted. Three types of estimation errors for mean and covariance information are studied in this paper and the corresponding formulations and techniques to handle these types of errors are presented.

AB Drawing on the concept of the scientific public sphere, this study examines the public sensemaking of communicative AI (e.g., generative AI) on social media. Advancing a framework encompassing cognitive (technology vs. use) and affective (positive vs. negative) dimensions of the public discourse on communicative AI, we analyzed global Twitter (now X) conversations about generative AI tools. Findings showed that the text generator (ChatGPT) discussions centered more on the technology-centered themes, whereas the image generator discussions emphasized their uses. ChatGPT received mixed sentiments in technology-related discussions, while there was more positive sentiment about the its uses. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB Forecasts of water use are crucial to efficiently manage water utilities to meet growing demand in urban areas. Improved household-level forecasts may be useful to water managers in order to accurately identify, and potentially target for management and conservation, low-efficiency homes and relative high-demand customers. Advanced machine learning (ML) techniques are available for feature-based predictions, but many of these methods ignore multiscale spatiotemporal associations that may improve prediction accuracy. We use a large dataset collected by Tampa Bay Water, a regional water wholesaler in southwest Florida, to evaluate an array of spatiotemporal statistical models and ML algorithms using out-of-sample prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification to find the best tools for forecasting household-level monthly water demand. Time series models appear to provide the best short-term forecasts, indicating that the temporal dynamics of water use are more important for prediction than any exogenous features.

AB Identifying food insecure households in an accurate and cost-effective way is important for targeted food policy interventions. Since predictive accuracy depends partly on which indicators are used to identify food insecure households, it is important to assess the performance of indicators that are relatively easy and inexpensive to collect yet can proxy for the "gold standard" food security indicator, calorie intake. We study the effectiveness of different variable combinations and methods in predicting calorie-based food security among poor households and communities in rural Bangladesh. We use basic household information as a benchmark set for predicting calorie-based food security. We then assess the gain in predictive power obtained by adding subjective food security indicators (e.g., self-reported days without sufficient food), the dietary diversity score (DDS), and the combination of both sets to our model of calorie-based food security. We apply machine learning as well as traditional econometric methods in estimation. We find that the overall predictive accuracy rises from 63% to 69% when we add the subjective and DDS sets to the benchmark set. Our study demonstrates that while alternative indicators and methods are not always accurate in predicting calorie intake, DDS related indicators do improve accuracy compared to a simple benchmark set.

AB We study the problem of scheduling a Flexible Flow System (FFS) while utilizing machine learning techniques. Specifically, the effect of incorporating Feature Construction in an existing adaptive learning-based decision support system is investigated. The primary purpose of constructing features is to increase the efficiency of obtaining information from available data by using new features in addition to the initial set of features. There is a need to obtain information effectively while scheduling an FFS. The incorporation of feature construction in such a framework is thus beneficial, which is documented in our preliminary results.

AB Particulate and surfactant systems are an integral part either in processing or product lines in essentially every major industry, including Energy and Minerals, Pharmaceutical, Agriculture & Food, Microelectronics, Healthcare, Cosmetics, Consumer Products, and Analytical Instrumentation & Services. In most applications, product and process specifications depend on the synergistic or competitive interactions between the particles and reagent schemes. The primary goal of our research efforts has been to generate the structure-property-performance correlations-based knowledge and technology platforms for industry to develop more sustainable products and processes. Engineering the physicochemical/mechanical properties of surfaces, particles, and self-assembling surfactant systems enables their enhanced performance in industrial applications. Specifically, understanding and control of the nano and atomic -scale forces between particles and synthesis of functionalized particles form the foundation for targeted contributions in biomedical, advanced materials and minerals, sensor, and coating technologies. A synoptic overview of selected projects is presented in this review. Additional details can be found in the topic-specific references listed at the end of this manuscript.

AB The importance of mental health is increasingly emphasized in modern society. The assessment of mental health qualities among college and university students as the future workforce holds significant significance. Therefore, this study, aiming to streamline the process of writing quality evaluations and enhance the fairness of assessment comments, explores the use of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) technology in deep learning to evaluate the mental health qualities of college and university students through the unique avenue of sports. Firstly, GAN and Sequence Generative Adversarial Network (SeqGAN) models are introduced. Secondly, GAN is employed to construct a model for generating evaluation texts, encompassing the construction of a generator and discriminator, along with the introduction of a reward function. Finally, the constructed model is utilized to train on evaluation texts related to the mental health qualities of college and university students engaged in sports, validating the effectiveness of the model. The results indicate: (1) The pre-training of the generator in the constructed text generation model stabilizes after the 10th epoch. In contrast, the pre-training of the discriminator gradually stabilizes after the 35th epoch, demonstrating overall good training effectiveness. (2) When the generator's update speed surpasses that of the discriminator, the model's loss does not converge. However, with a reduction in the ratio of rounds between the two, there is a noticeable improvement in the convergence of the model. (3) The mean score of adaptability quality is the highest among the four indicators, suggesting a strong correlation between comment generation and adaptability quality. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed text generation model in semantic control. This study aims to advance the level of mental health education among college and university students in the sports domain, providing theoretical references for enhancing the effectiveness of quality education assessments in other subjects as well.

Users can then either respond to ChatGPT, regenerate the previous response, or "like" the response and give feedback. OpenAI improved the program on March 14th, 2023, with the release of GPT 4, which promised better reasoning ability. Both these iterations of ChatGPT have attracted significant attention from researchers due to the software's remarkably enhanced capabilities compared to earlier versions. Due to its inherent value as a research tool, ChatGPT will likely become a permanent fixture, so a thorough evaluation of ethical and professional boundaries is crucial. In this opinion paper, we explore ChatGPT 4.0 by addressing: a) its capabilities, b) its limitations and weaknesses, and c) strategies for fact-checking its output to ensure high-quality responses. Subsequently, the authors delve into the diverse implications of this software and discuss how it can be optimally employed to advance research in technology and various other domains.

AB The recent Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in the Americas ranks among the largest outbreaks in modern times. Like other mosquito-borne flaviviruses, ZIKV circulates in sylvatic cycles among primates that can serve as reservoirs of spillover infection to humans. Identifying sylvatic reservoirs is critical to mitigating spillover risk, but relevant surveillance and biological data remain limited for this and most other zoonoses. We confronted this data sparsity by combining a machine learning method, Bayesian multi-label learning, with a multiple imputation method on primate traits. The resulting models distinguished flavivirus-positive primates with 82% accuracy and suggest that species posing the greatest spillover risk are also among the best adapted to human habitations. Given pervasive data sparsity describing animal hosts, and the virtual guarantee of data sparsity in scenarios involving novel or emerging zoonoses, we show that computational methods can be useful in extracting actionable inference from available data to support improved epidemiological response and prevention.

AB The availability of timely and accurate information about plant conditions is critical for making informed de-cisions for maintaining or improving agricultural productivity. However, field data collection is often laborious and time-consuming, underscoring the need for accurate and efficient methods to monitor crop growth and development. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of combining unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based imaging and machine learning (ML) techniques for monitoring sweet corn (Zea mays var. saccharata) height, biomass, and yield. The study was conducted at the Tropical Research and Education Center (TREC) during the winter (dry) season of 2020-2021 using 16 experimental plots planted with sweet corn. The treatments were set up in a completely randomized block design (RCBD) with four irrigation treatments of 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% full irrigation with four replications each. Field data collection included plant height, fresh and dry biomass, and yield. In addition, UAV images were collected using the DJI Matrice 210 v2 UAV (SZ DJI Technology Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China) equipped with a MicaSense RedEdge-MX multispectral sensor (MicaSense, Seattle, WA, USA). Image processing was done with Pix4Dmapper 4.7.5 (Pix4D S.A., Prilly, Switzerland). A crop surface model, representing estimated plant height (UAVH), was calculated based on pixel -to-pixel differences between digital surface and terrain models. A simple linear regression model was used to estimate sweet corn biomass and yield from UAV images estimated plant height (UAVH). In addition, two linear algorithms known as a linear model (LM) and Lasso and elastic-net regularized generalized linear model (GLMNET) and three non-linear ML algorithms including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) were used to predict plant height and biomass. These algorithms were chosen due to their reliable performance and ability to learn complex non-linear relationships. Eight vegetation indices with UAVH were also used to evaluate the ML models' performance to predict plant height and biomass. Results confirmed that UAV imaging could be effectively used to estimate plant height (d = 0.99, r2 = 0.99, and MAE = 5 cm). Estimated fresh and dry biomass from UAV imaging also had good agreements with measured data with r2 values of 0.75 and 0.70, respectively. A statistically significant linear correlation between measured fresh yield at harvest and UAVH was found with d, adjusted r2, and MAE of 0.84, 0.66, and 67 g m- 2, respectively. Evaluation of ML algorithms revealed that all models performed well for plant biomass estimation with d values between 0.88 and 0.99. However, the kNN and SVM outperformed all other models for biomass estimation. GMLNET performed better than other models for plant height estimation. Overall, results revealed that UAV imaging and ML models could be effectively used for monitoring plant phenotypic characteristics such as height, yield, and biomass.

AB The JHU-ISI Gesture and Skill Assessment Working Set (JIGSAWS) dataset has proven to be a foundational component of modern work on the skill analysis of robotic surgeons. In particular, methods using either the system's kinematics or video data have shown to be able to classify operators into distinct experience levels, and recent approaches have even ventured to recover numeric skill ratings assigned to assessment sessions. Although prior works have achieved positive results in these directions, challenges still remain with classification across all three levels of operator training amounts and objective skill rating regressions. To this end, we perform the first statistical analysis of the dataset itself and compile the results here. We find limited relationships between the amount of experience or training of an operator and their performance in JIGSAWS. Moreover, as operator-side kinematics have well-known relationships with their skill, previous works have used both robot and operator-side kinematics to classify operator skill; we find the first explicit relationships between pure robot-side kinematics and surgical performance. Finally, we analyze the robotic kinematic trends associated with high performance in JIGSAWS tasks and present how they may be used as indicators in human and automated surgeon training.

AB Gravitational lensing data is frequently collected at low resolution due to instrumental limitations and observing conditions. Machine learning-based super-resolution techniques offer a method to enhance the resolution of these images, enabling more precise measurements of lensing effects and a better understanding of the matter distribution in the lensing system. This enhancement can significantly improve our knowledge of the distribution of mass within the lensing galaxy and its environment, as well as the properties of the background source being lensed. Traditional super-resolution techniques typically learn a mapping function from lower-resolution to higher-resolution samples. However, these methods are often constrained by their dependence on optimizing a fixed distance function, which can result in the loss of intricate details crucial for astrophysical analysis. In this work, we introduce DiffLense, a novel super-resolution pipeline based on a conditional diffusion model specifically designed to enhance the resolution of gravitational lensing images obtained from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP). Our approach adopts a generative model, leveraging the detailed structural information present in Hubble space telescope (HST) counterparts. The diffusion model, trained to generate HST data, is conditioned on HSC data pre-processed with denoising techniques and thresholding to significantly reduce noise and background interference. This process leads to a more distinct and less overlapping conditional distribution during the model's training phase. We demonstrate that DiffLense outperforms existing state-of-the-art single-image super-resolution techniques, particularly in retaining the fine details necessary for astrophysical analyses.

AB Storytelling is a human universal. The ubiquity of stories and the rapid development in Artificial Intelligence (AI) pose important questions: can AI like ChatGPT tell engaging and persuasive stories? If so, what makes a narrative engaging and persuasive? Three pre-registered experiments comparing human-generated narratives from existing research and the ChatGPT-generated versions using descriptions and materials from these studies show that labeling AI as a narrative source led to lower transportation, higher counterarguing, and lower story-consistent beliefs. However, AI-generated narratives led to lower (Study 1 and 3) or similar levels (Study 2) of counterarguing than the human-generated version. Readers showed lower (Study 2) or similar levels of transportation (Study 1 and 3) when reading the AI- than the human-generated stories. We suggest the AI model's linguistic competence and logical coherence contribute to its stories' verisimilitude. However, AI's lack of lived experience and creativity may limit its storytelling ability.

AB Recent years have seen the growth in popularity of neural networks for business decision support because of their capabilities' for modeling, estimating, and classifying. Compared to other AI methods for problem solving such as expert systems, neural network approaches are especially useful far their ability to learn adaptively from observations. However, neural network learning performed by algorithms such as back-propagation (BP) are known to be slow due to the size of the search space involved and also the iterative manner in which the algorithm works. In this paper, we show that the degree of difficulty in neural network learning is inherent in the given set of training examples. We propose a technique for measuring such learning difficulty, and then develop a feature construction methodology that helps transform the training data so that both. the learning speed and classification accuracy of neural network algorithms are improved, We show the efficacy of the proposed method for financial risk classification, a domain characterized by frequent data noise, lack of functional structure, and high attribute interactions. Moreover, the empirical studies also provide insights into the structural characteristics of neural networks with respect to the input data used as well as possible mechanisms to improve the learning performance.

AB Background: Available therapies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) can only alleviate and delay the advance of symptoms, with the greatest impact eventually achieved when provided at an early stage. Thus, early identification of which subjects at high risk, e.g., with MCI, will later develop AD is of key importance. Currently available machine learning algorithms achieve only limited predictive accuracy or they are based on expensive and hard-to-collect information.
   Objective: The current study aims to develop an algorithm for a 3-year prediction of conversion to AD in MCI and PreMCI subjects based only on non-invasively and effectively collectable predictors.
   Methods: A dataset of 123 MCI/PreMCI subjects was used to train different machine learning techniques. Baseline information regarding sociodemographic characteristics, clinical and neuropsychological test scores, cardiovascular risk indexes, and a visual rating scale for brain atrophy was used to extract 36 predictors. Leave-pair-out-cross-validation was employed as validation strategy and a recursive feature elimination procedure was applied to identify a relevant subset of predictors.
   Results: 16 predictors were selected from all domains excluding sociodemographic information. The best model resulted a support vector machine with radial-basis function kernel (whole sample: AUC= 0.962, best balanced accuracy = 0.913; MCI sub-group alone: AUC= 0.914, best balanced accuracy = 0.874).
   Conclusions: Our algorithm shows very high cross-validated performances that outperform the vast majority of the currently available algorithms, and all those which use only non-invasive and effectively assessable predictors. Further testing and optimization in independent samples will warrant its application in both clinical practice and clinical trials.

AB Antibodies play a pivotal role in immune defense and serve as key therapeutic agents. The process of affinity maturation, wherein antibodies evolve through somatic mutations to achieve heightened specificity and affinity to target antigens, is crucial for effective immune response. Despite their significance, assessing antibody-antigen binding affinity remains challenging due to limitations in conventional wet lab techniques. To address this, we introduce AntiFormer, a graph-based large language model designed to predict antibody binding affinity. AntiFormer incorporates sequence information into a graph-based framework, allowing for precise prediction of binding affinity. Through extensive evaluations, AntiFormer demonstrates superior performance compared with existing methods, offering accurate predictions with reduced computational time. Application of AntiFormer to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 patient samples reveals antibodies with strong neutralizing capabilities, providing insights for therapeutic development and vaccination strategies. Furthermore, analysis of individual samples following influenza vaccination elucidates differences in antibody response between young and older adults. AntiFormer identifies specific clonotypes with enhanced binding affinity post-vaccination, particularly in young individuals, suggesting age-related variations in immune response dynamics. Moreover, our findings underscore the importance of large clonotype category in driving affinity maturation and immune modulation. Overall, AntiFormer is a promising approach to accelerate antibody-based diagnostics and therapeutics, bridging the gap between traditional methods and complex antibody maturation processes.

AB This paper considers feature selection for data classification in the presence of a huge number of irrelevant features. We propose a new feature-selection algorithm that addresses several major issues with prior work, including problems with algorithm implementation, computational complexity, and solution accuracy. The key idea is to decompose an arbitrarily complex nonlinear problem into a set of locally linear ones through local learning, and then learn feature relevance globally within the large margin framework. The proposed algorithm is based on well-established machine learning and numerical analysis techniques, without making any assumptions about the underlying data distribution. It is capable of processing many thousands of features within minutes on a personal computer while maintaining a very high accuracy that is nearly insensitive to a growing number of irrelevant features. Theoretical analyses of the algorithm's sample complexity suggest that the algorithm has a logarithmical sample complexity with respect to the number of features. Experiments on 11 synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the viability of our formulation of the feature-selection problem for supervised learning and the effectiveness of our algorithm.

TI Classifying muscle parameters with artificial neural networks and
   simulated lateral pinch data
SO PLOS ONE
LA English
DT Article
ID ARCHITECTURE; CROSS; CAPACITY
AB Objective Hill-type muscle models are widely employed in simulations of human movement. Yet, the parameters underlying these models are difficult or impossible to measure in vivo. Prior studies demonstrate that Hill-type muscle parameters are encoded within dynamometric data. But, a generalizable approach for estimating these parameters from dynamometric data has not been realized. We aimed to leverage musculoskeletal models and artificial neural networks to classify one Hill-type muscle parameter (maximum isometric force) from easily measurable dynamometric data (simulated lateral pinch force). We tested two neural networks (feedforward and long short-term memory) to identify if accounting for dynamic behavior improved accuracy.
   Methods We generated four datasets via forward dynamics, each with increasing complexity from adjustments to more muscles. Simulations were grouped and evaluated to show how varying the maximum isometric force of thumb muscles affects lateral pinch force. Both neural networks classified these groups from lateral pinch force alone.
   Results Both neural networks achieved accuracies above 80% for datasets which varied only the flexor pollicis longus and/or the abductor pollicis longus. The inclusion of muscles with redundant functions dropped model accuracies to below 30%. While both neural networks were consistently more accurate than random guess, the long short-term memory model was not consistently more accurate than the feedforward model.
   Conclusion Our investigations demonstrate that artificial neural networks provide an inexpensive, data-driven approach for approximating Hill-type muscle-tendon parameters from easily measurable data. However, muscles of redundant function or of little impact to force production make parameter classification more challenging.

AB The ready availability of interactive platforms has produced a new generation of students able to utilize computer-based learning tools with ease and comfort. The potential to better "explore by yourself" the lecture material permits students to have an enhanced learning experience and stimulates them to tinker with equation parameters generating insightful figures or animations. Used in the classroom, it emboldens students to have a deeper comprehension of complex derivations or mathematical expressions. We illustrate the power of interactive learning platforms by presenting educational Jupyter notebooks for the study of a fundamental problem in quantum chemistry: the motion of a particle in ID and 2D space. Although simple, this model offers the possibility to explore several important quantum chemistry concepts such as Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, confinement leading to quantization, tunneling effect, and even bonding and antibonding properties. We present four Jupyter notebooks that gradually walk the student from the properties of a free particle to the properties of a particle in a double potential well. Our experience gained from the implementation of the material in the undergraduate and graduate curriculum is discussed, including student feedback and examples of complementary homework to be used in the classroom.

AB This review paper provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) spectroscopy for substance detection, highlighting its principles, methodologies, and applications. The paper elucidates the fundamental physics underlying NQR spectroscopy, emphasizing the interaction between nuclear quadrupole moments and electric field gradients. It explores the various experimental techniques and instrumentation developments that have enabled the sensitive detection and precise characterization of substances containing quadrupolar nuclei. A significant portion of the survey is dedicated to discussing the diverse applications of NQR spectroscopy, including the detection of explosives, drug pharmaceuticals, and material authentication. Furthermore, the survey examines the challenges and limitations associated with NQR spectroscopy, including issues related to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), temperature dependency, and substance restrictions. Strategies to overcome these challenges are discussed, offering insights into the future directions of NQR spectroscopy research that includes artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things (IoT) integration, incorporating a cloud database for NQR parameter storage, and multi-modal analysis.

AB Forest plantations are globally important for the economy and are significant for carbon sequestration. Properly managing plantations requires accurate information about stand timber stocks. In this study, we used the area (ABA) and individual tree (ITD) based approaches for estimating stem volume in fast-growing Eucalyptus spp forest plantations. Herein, we propose a new method to improve individual tree detection (ITD) in dense canopy homogeneous forests and assess the effects of stand age, slope and scan angle on ITD accuracy. Field and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data were collected in Eucalyptus urophylla x Eucalyptus grandis even-aged forest stands located in the mountainous region of the Rio Doce Valley, southeastern Brazil. We tested five methods to estimate volume from LiDAR-derived metrics using ABA: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and linear and Gompertz models. LiDAR-derived canopy metrics were selected using the Recursive Feature Elimination algorithm and Spearman's correlation, for nonparametric and parametric methods, respectively. For the ITD, we tested three ITD methods: two local maxima filters and the watershed method. All methods were tested adding our proposed procedure of Tree Buffer Exclusion (TBE), resulting in 35 possibilities for treetop detection. Stem volume for this approach was estimated using the Schumacher and Hall model. Estimated volumes in both ABA and ITD approaches were compared to the field observed values using the F-test. Overall, the ABA with ANN was found to be better for stand volume estimation (r(y (y) over cap) = 0.95 and RMSE = 14.4%). Although the ITD results showed similar precision (r(y (y) over cap)= 0.94 and RMSE = 16.4%) to the ABA, the results underestimated stem volume in younger stands and in gently sloping terrain (< 25%). Stem volume maps also differed between the approaches; ITD represented the stand variability better. In addition, we discuss the importance of LiDAR metrics as input variables for stem volume estimation methods and the possible issues related to the ABA and ITD performance.

AB The task personalized recommendation problems in software crowdsourcing systems have unique characteristics, i.e., large task flow, high task complexity, long development cycle, winning task competitions, professional ability requirements, etc. However, existing software crowdsourcing recommendation mechanisms do not consider the contextual information of crowdsourcing tasks. In particular, the effects of crowdsourcing workers' interest changes and capability constraints on task selection are usually ignored. Therefore, this study proposes a new worker capability-correction long- and short-term attention network (CLSAN) recommendation framework. Firstly, explicit and implicit features are obtained from the feature data of crowdsourcing workers and historical crowdsourcing tasks. The long-term and short-term feature layers are extracted by adding LSTM to the historical tasks; the attention weight of user preference is calculated by integrating the attention mechanism to obtain each user's personalized preference. Secondly, this study considers that the capabilities of the worker need to be matched with the skills required for the software task. We design a worker capability correction model that uses Word2Vec software to obtain competency similarities between crowdsourcing workers and tasks, thereby determining the priority of tasks that satisfy the worker's capability. The experimental results show that CLSAN can accurately evaluate the changes of interest preferences of crowdsourcing workers, and effectively improve the quality and efficiency of crowdsourcing recommendations.

TI Analytical Modeling of Exoplanet Transit Spectroscopy with Dimensional

SO ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL

ID TRANSMISSION SPECTRA; CLOUD STRUCTURE; ATMOSPHERES
AB The physical characteristics and atmospheric chemical composition of newly discovered exoplanets are often inferred from their transit spectra, which are obtained from complex numerical models of radiative transfer. Alternatively, simple analytical expressions provide insightful physical intuition into the relevant atmospheric processes. The deep-learning revolution has opened the door for deriving such analytical results directly with a computer algorithm fitting to the data. As a proof of concept, we successfully demonstrate the use of symbolic regression on synthetic data for the transit radii of generic hot-Jupiter exoplanets to derive a corresponding analytical formula. As a preprocessing step, we use dimensional analysis to identify the relevant dimensionless combinations of variables and reduce the number of independent inputs, which improves the performance of the symbolic regression. The dimensional analysis also allowed us to mathematically derive and properly parameterize the most general family of degeneracies among the input atmospheric parameters that affect the characterization of an exoplanet atmosphere through transit spectroscopy.

AB Integrating genomic, hyperspectral imaging (HSI), and environmental data enhances wheat yield predictions, with HSI providing detailed spectral insights for predicting complex grain yield (GY) traits. Incorporating HSI data with single nucleotide polymorphic markers (SNPs) resulted in a substantial improvement in predictive ability compared to the conventional genomic prediction models. Over the course of several years, the prediction ability varied due to diverse weather conditions. The most comprehensive parametric model tested, which included SNPs, HSI, and environmental covariates data, consistently achieved the best results, closely followed by machine learning (ML) approaches when considering the same omics data. For example, the most comprehensive model (M9), under the forward prediction cross-validation scheme, predicted the GY of the 2023 growing season using data from 2021 and 2022 for a correlation between predicted and observed values of 0.53. This model demonstrated superior performance compared to less complex models, emphasizing the advantage of integrating numerous data sources and their interactive effects. Furthermore, when comparing the top 25% of the predicted lines versus the corresponding observed lines with the highest GY, the M9 model returned a coincide index (CI) of 55% (i.e., in both sets, 55% of the top 25% values were common), whereas for the highest performing ML model (gradient boosting regression), the CI was of 46%. This study highlights the potential of multi-data source approaches to accelerate the selection of heat-tolerant wheat genotypes.

AB The ongoing enzootic circulation of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the Middle East and North Africa is increasingly raising the concern about the possibility of its recombination with other human-adapted coronaviruses, particularly the pandemic SARS-CoV-2. We aim to provide an updated picture about ecological niches of MERS-CoV and associated socio-environmental drivers. Based on 356 confirmed MERS cases with animal contact reported to the WHO and 63 records of animal infections collected from the literature as of 30 May 2020, we assessed ecological niches of MERS-CoV using an ensemble model integrating three machine learning algorithms. With a high predictive accuracy (area under receiver operating characteristic curve = 91.66% in test data), the ensemble model estimated that ecologically suitable areas span over the Middle East, South Asia and the whole North Africa, much wider than the range of reported locally infected MERS cases and test-positive animal samples. Ecological suitability for MERS-CoV was significantly associated with high levels of bareland coverage (relative contribution = 30.06%), population density (7.28%), average temperature (6.48%) and camel density (6.20%). Future surveillance and intervention programs should target the high-risk populations and regions informed by updated quantitative analyses.

AB We model amorphous Zirconia-doped Tantala with machine learning interactomc potentials based on explicit multielement spectral neighbor analysis (EME-SNAP). These atomic structure models can reproduce partial ra-dial distribution functions obtained from first-principles calculations and elastic moduli found from experimental measurements. The two-body pair forces calculated from EME-SNAP further affirm that the potentials capture the atomic interactions well. Molecular dynamics simulations of simulated annealing with EME-SNAP show that the final density of the amorphous models depends on the thermal history even when the annealing rate is kept constant, which captures experimental observations of history-dependent densities. Mechanical spectroscopy is also simulated using both Morse-Beest-Kramer-Santen pair potentials and EME-SNAP. The success in applying the EME-SNAP to amorphous Zirconia-doped Tantala pushes the boundaries of simulation accuracy and system size and enables better and more realistic atomistic modeling for amorphous systems. There are still some limitations in applying the potentials generated in this paper. They are only optimized for trained amorphous phases; high-temperature stability and transferability need to be further investigated.

AB In this paper, we propose a novel no-reference three-dimensional (3-D) image quality assessment (NR-SIQA) method, which takes three types of visual perceptual characteristics into consideration, including image distortion, depth perception, and binocular combination perception. The estimation of image distortion is based on the observation that blurriness, noisiness, and blockiness are considered as three important factors that affect image quality. Moreover, the value difference between any two neighboring pixels for any image satisfies a generalized Laplace distribution, which will be changed with various types of distortion existing in the image. Since the major difference between 2-D images and 3-D images is the depth, a disparity search algorithm is a key element for 3-D perception assessment. To address this, a robust disparity search algorithm is first designed based on the Gaussian average SSIM, followed by the generation of cyclopean image, rivalry map, depth map, and weight map. These four maps have taken the visual perceptual characteristics into consideration. Three types of features relating to image distortion, depth perception, and binocular disparity are extracted from these maps and stereo-pairs. In the end, machine learning is utilized to map these features to human perceptual score. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the recent full reference SIQA and NR-SIQA metrics on two publicly available stereoscopic image quality assessment databases.

TI Caution! AI Bot Has Entered the Patient Chat: ChatGPT Has Limitations in
   Providing Accurate Urologic Healthcare Advice
SO UROLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB OBJECTIVE To conduct the first study examining the accuracy of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot, derived patient counseling responses based on clinical care guidelines in urology using a validated questionnaire.METHODS We asked ChatGPT a set of 13 urological guideline-based questions three times. Answers were evaluated for appropriateness and using Brief DISCERN (BD), a validated healthcare in-formation assessment questionnaire. Data analysis included descriptive statistics and Student's t test (SAS Studio).RESULTS 60% (115/195) of ChatGPT responses were deemed appropriate. Variability existed between responses to the same prompt, with 25% of the 13 question sets having discordant appropriateness designations. The average BD score was 16.8 +/- 3.59. Only 7 (54%) of 13 topics and 21 (54%) of 39 responses met the BD cut-off score of >= 16 to denote good-quality content. Appropriateness was associated with higher overall and Relevance domain scores (both P < .01). The lowest BD domain scores were for Source categories, since ChatGPT does not provide references by default. With prompting, 92.3% had >= 1 incorrect, misinterpreted, or nonfunctional citations.CONCLUSION While ChatGPT provides appropriate responses to urological questions more than half of the time, it misinterprets clinical care guidelines, dismisses important contextual information, conceals its sources, and provides inappropriate references. Chatbot models hold great promise, but users should be cautious when interpreting healthcare-related advice from existing AI models. Additional training and modifications are needed before these AI models will be ready for reliable use by patients and providers.

AB The introduction of deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a treatment for medication-refractory essential tremor in the late 1980s revealed, for the first time, that "chronically" implanted brain hardware had the potential to modulate neurologic function with surprisingly low morbidity. Over time, the therapeutic promise of DBS has become evident in Parkinson's disease and dystonia. In some experienced centers, complex tremor disorders, such as posttraumatic Holmes tremor and the tremor of multiple sclerosis, are being increasingly targeted. More recently, other indications, including obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette's syndrome, major depression, and chronic pain, have been proposed. As the field has expanded, our knowledge about potential cognitive side effects of DBS has also expanded. This article reviews the current knowledge regarding the impact of stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus internus, and ventralis intermedius nucleus of the thalamus on symptoms in essential tremor, Parkinson's disease, and dystonia. Also discussed are the emerging targets, what is known about the cognitive sequelae of DBS, and what has been learned about the complications and therapeutic failures.

AB BackgroundAcquired neonatal intestinal diseases have an array of overlapping presentations and are often labeled under the dichotomous classification of necrotizing enterocolitis (which is poorly defined) or spontaneous intestinal perforation, hindering more precise diagnosis and research. The objective of this study was to take a fresh look at neonatal intestinal disease classification using unsupervised machine learning.MethodsPatients admitted to the University of Florida Shands Neonatal Intensive Care Unit January 2013-September 2019 diagnosed with an intestinal injury, or had imaging findings of portal venous gas, pneumatosis, abdominal free air, or had an abdominal drain placed or exploratory laparotomy during admission were included. Congenital gastroschisis, omphalocele, intestinal atresia, malrotation were excluded. Data was collected via retrospective chart review with subsequent hierarchal, unsupervised clustering analysis.ResultsFive clusters of intestinal injury were identified: Cluster 1 deemed the "Low Mortality" cluster, Cluster 2 deemed the "Mature with Inflammation" cluster, Cluster 3 deemed the "Immature with High Mortality" cluster, Cluster 4 deemed the "Late Injury at Full Feeds" cluster, and Cluster 5 deemed the "Late Injury with High Rate of Intestinal Necrosis" cluster.ConclusionUnsupervised machine learning can be used to cluster acquired neonatal intestinal injuries. Future study with larger multicenter datasets is needed to further refine and classify types of intestinal diseases.ImpactUnsupervised machine learning can be used to cluster types of acquired neonatal intestinal injury.Five major clusters of acquired neonatal intestinal injury are described, each with unique features.The clusters herein described deserve future, multicenter study to determine more specific early biomarkers and tailored therapeutic interventions to improve outcomes of often devastating neonatal acquired intestinal injuries.

AB The distribution and abundance of Phlebotomus papatasi, the primary vector of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis in most semi-/arid countries, is a major public health challenge. This study compares several approaches to model the spatial distribution of the species in an endemic region of the disease in Golestan province, northeast of Iran. The intent is to assist decision makers for targeted interventions. We developed a geo-database of the collected Phlebotominae sand flies from different parts of the study region. Sticky paper traps coated with castor oil were used to collect sand flies. In 44 out of 142 sampling sites, Ph. papatasi was present. We also gathered and prepared data on related environmental factors including topography, weather variables, distance to main rivers and remotely sensed data such as normalized difference vegetation cover and land surface temperature (LST) in a GIS framework. Applicability of three classifiers: (vanilla) logistic regression, random forest and support vector machine (SVM) were compared for predicting presence/absence of the vector. Predictive performances were compared using an independent dataset to generate area under the ROC curve (AUC) and Kappa statistics. All three models successfully predicted the presence/absence of the vector, however, the SVM classifier (Accuracy = 0.906, AUC = 0.974, Kappa = 0.876) outperformed the other classifiers on predicting accuracy. Moreover, this classifier was the most sensitive (85%), and the most specific (93%) model. Sensitivity analysis of the most accurate model (i.e. SVM) revealed that slope, nighttime LST in October and mean temperature of the wettest quarter were among the most important predictors. The findings suggest that machine learning techniques, especially the SVM classifier, when coupled with GIS and remote sensing data can be a useful and cost-effective way for identifying habitat suitability of the species.

AB The integration of sub-6 GHz and millimeter wave (mmWave) bands has a great potential to enable both reliable coverage and high data rate in future vehicular networks. Nevertheless, during mmWave vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) handovers, the coverage blindness of directional beams makes it a significant challenge to discover target mmWave remote radio units (mmW-RRUs) whose active beams may radiate somewhere that the handover vehicles are not in. Besides, fast and soft handovers are also urgently needed in vehicular networks. Based on these observations, to solve the target discovery problem, we utilize channel state information (CSI) of sub-6 GHz bands and Kernel-based machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict vehicles' positions and then use them to pre-activate target mmW-RRUs. Considering that the regular movement of vehicles on almost linearly paved roads with finite corner turns will generate some regularity in handovers, to accelerate handovers, we propose to use historical handover data and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) ML algorithms to predict handover decisions without involving time-consuming target selection and beam training processes. To achieve soft handovers, we propose to employ vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) connections to forward data for V2I links. The theoretical and simulation results are provided to validate the feasibility of the proposed schemes.

AB The advancement in sensors, robotics, and artificial intelligence has enabled a series of methods such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), semantic segmentation, and point cloud registration to help with the reality capture process. To completely investigate an unknown indoor space, obtaining a general spatial comprehension as well as detailed scene reconstruction for a digital twin model requires a deeper insight into the characteristics of different ranging sensors, as well as corresponding techniques to combine data from distinct systems. This paper discusses the necessity and workflow of utilizing two distinct types of scanning sensors, including depth camera and light detection and ranging sensor (LiDAR), paired with a quadrupedal ground robot to obtain spatial data of a large, complex indoor space. A digital twin model was built in real time with two SLAM methods and then consolidated with the geometric feature extraction methods of fast point feature histograms (FPFH) and fast global registration. Finally, the reconstructed scene was streamed to a HoloLens 2 headset to create an illusion of seeing through walls. Results showed that both the depth camera and LiDAR could handle a large space reality capture with both required coverage and fidelity with textural information. As a result, the proposed workflow and analytical pipeline provides a hierarchical data fusion strategy to integrate the advantages of distinct sensing methods and to carry out a complete indoor investigation. It also validates the feasibility of robot-assisted reality capture in larger spaces.

We give a set of analytic conditions that characterize the empirical risk minimization methods and their approximations that are distribution-free consistent. Then utilizing the weak topology of the feature space, we show that the support vector regression, possibly with a discontinuous kernel, is distribution-free consistent. Moreover, a tighter generalization error bound is shown to be achieved in certain cases if the value of the regularization parameter grows as the sample size increases. The results carry over to the nu-support vector regression.

AB In the past few years, a new crop of transformer-based language models such as Google's BERT and OpenAI's ChatGPT has become increasingly popular in text analysis, owing their success to their ability to capture the entire document's context. These new methods, however, have yet to percolate into tourism academic literature. This paper aims to fill in this gap by providing a comparative analysis of these instruments against the commonly used Latent Dirichlet Allocation for topic extraction of contrasting tourism-related data: coherent vs. noisy, short vs. long, and small vs. large corpus size. The data are typical of tourism literature and include comments of followers of a popular blogger, TripAdvisor reviews, and review titles. We provide recommendations of data domains where the review methods demonstrate the best performance, consider success dimensions, and discuss each method's strong and weak sides. In general, GPT tends to return comprehensive, highly interpretable, and relevant to the real-world topics for all datasets, including the noisy ones, and at all scales. Meanwhile, ChatGPT is the most vulnerable to the issue of trust common to the "black box" model, which we explore in detail.

AB The use of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) is increasing among young adults. However, there are few studies regarding predictors of ENDS initiation in tobacco-naive young adults. Identifying the risk and protective factors of ENDS initiation that are specific to tobacco-naive young adults will enable the creation of targeted policies and prevention programs. This study used machine learning (ML) to create predictive models, identify risk and protective factors for ENDS initiation for tobacco-naive young adults, and the relationship between these predictors and the prediction of ENDS initiation. We used nationally representative data of tobacco-naive young adults in the U.S drawn from the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) longitudinal cohort survey. Respondents were young adults (18-24 years) who had never used any tobacco products in Wave 4 and who completed Waves 4 and 5 interviews. ML techniques were used to create models and determine predictors at 1-year follow-up from Wave 4 data. Among the 2,746 tobacco-naive young adults at baseline, 309 initiated ENDS use at 1-year follow-up. The top five prospective predictors of ENDS initiation were susceptibility to ENDS, increased days of physical exercise specifically designed to strengthen muscles, frequency of social media use, marijuana use and susceptibility to cigarettes. This study identified previously unreported and emerging predictors of ENDS initiation that warrant further investigation and provided comprehensive information on the predictors of ENDS initiation. Furthermore, this study showed that ML is a promising technique that can aid ENDS monitoring and prevention programs.

AB It is challenging to forecast high-resolution spatial-temporal patterns of intra-urban air pollution and identify impacting factors at the regional scale. Studies have attempted to capture features of air pollutants such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) using land use regression models, but this method overlooks the multi-collinearity of factors, non-linear correlations between factors and air pollutants, and it fails to perform well when processing daily data. However, machine learning is a feasible approach for establishing persuasive intra-urban air pollution daily variation models. In this article, random forest is utilised to establish intra-urban PM2.5 and NO2 spatial-temporal variation models and is compared to the traditional land use regression method. Taking the city of Shanghai, China as the case area, 36 station-measured daily records in two and a half years of PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations were collected. And over 80 different predictors associated with meteorological and geographical conditions, transportation, community population density, land use and points of interest are used to construct the land use regression and random forest models. Results from the two methods are compared and impacting factors identified. Explained variance (R-2) is used to quantify and compare model performance. The final land use regression model explains 49.3% and 42.2% of the spatial variation in ambient PM2.5 and NO2, respectively, whereas the random forest model explains 78.1% and 60.5% of the variance. Regression mappings for unsampled sites on a grid pattern of 1 km x 1 km are also implemented. The random forest model is shown to perform much better than the land use regression model. In general, the findings suggest that the random forest approach offers a robust improvement in predicting performance compared to the land use regression model in estimating daily spatial variations in ambient PM2.5 and NO2.

AB Background Machine learning (ML) methodology development for the classification of immune states in adaptive immune receptor repertoires (AIRRs) has seen a recent surge of interest. However, so far, there does not exist a systematic evaluation of scenarios where classical ML methods (such as penalized logistic regression) already perform adequately for AIRR classification. This hinders investigative reorientation to those scenarios where method development of more sophisticated ML approaches may be required.
   Results To identify those scenarios where a baseline ML method is able to perform well for AIRR classification, we generated a collection of synthetic AIRR benchmark data sets encompassing a wide range of data set architecture-associated and immune state-associated sequence patterns (signal) complexity. We trained approximate to 1,700 ML models with varying assumptions regarding immune signal on approximate to 1,000 data sets with a total of approximate to 250,000 AIRRs containing approximate to 46 billion TCR beta CDR3 amino acid sequences, thereby surpassing the sample sizes of current state-of-the-art AIRR-ML setups by two orders of magnitude. We found that L1-penalized logistic regression achieved high prediction accuracy even when the immune signal occurs only in 1 out of 50,000 AIR sequences.
   Conclusions We provide a reference benchmark to guide new AIRR-ML classification methodology by (i) identifying those scenarios characterized by immune signal and data set complexity, where baseline methods already achieve high prediction accuracy, and (ii) facilitating realistic expectations of the performance of AIRR-ML models given training data set properties and assumptions. Our study serves as a template for defining specialized AIRR benchmark data sets for comprehensive benchmarking of AIRR-ML methods.

AB This paper presents a novel lattice based biomimetic neural network trained by means of a similarity measure derived from a lattice positive valuation. For a wide class of pattern recognition problems, the proposed artificial neural network, implemented as a dendritic hetero-associative memory delivers high percentages of successful classification. The memory is a feedforward dendritic network whose arithmetical operations are based on lattice algebra and can be applied to real multivalued inputs. In this approach, the realization of recognition tasks, shows the inherent capability of prototype-class pattern associations in a fast and straightforward manner without need of any iterative scheme subject to issues about convergence. Using an artificially designed data set we show how the proposed trained neural net classifies a test input pattern. Application to a few typical real-world data sets illustrate the overall network classification performance using different training and testing sample subsets generated randomly.

AB Great toe strength (GTS) weakness is linked to declines in balance and mobility. Accurately assessing GTS, particularly great toe extension strength (GTES), is often neglected in clinical evaluations due to cumbersome and subjective methods. This study aims to characterize the force development curve output from the ToeScale and examine GTES variations with age, sex, BMI, and grip strength (GS) using traditional analyses and machine learning (ML). We conducted a pilot, cross-sectional feasibility study with convenience samples. We assessed GS using a hand-grip dynamometer and GTES using the ToeScale. The data analysis included descriptive statistics, correlations, independent samples t-tests, and accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) scores for three ML models. Thirty-one participants (males: 9; females: 22), 14 young (18-24 years) and 17 older (>65 years) adults, participated in the study. Males had significantly higher peak GTES than females in both age groups. The associations of GTES parameters with BMI and GS varied by age and sex. The ML model accuracies and AUC scores were low-moderate but aligned with traditional analyses. Future studies with larger samples and optimized ML models are needed.

AB Understanding 3D scenes is a critical prerequisite for autonomous agents. Recently, LiDAR and other sensors have made large amounts of data available in the form of temporal sequences of point cloud frames. In this work, we propose a novel problem-sequential scene flow estimation (SSFE)-that aims to predict 3D scene flow for all pairs of point clouds in a given sequence. This is unlike the previously studied problem of scene flow estimation which focuses on two frames. We introduce the SPCM-Net architecture, which solves this problem by computing multi-scale spatiotemporal correlations between neighboring point clouds and then aggregating the correlation across time with an order-invariant recurrent unit. Our experimental evaluation confirms that recurrent processing of point cloud sequences results in significantly better SSFE compared to using only two frames. Additionally, we demonstrate that this approach can be effectively modified for sequential point cloud forecasting (SPF), a related problem that demands forecasting future point cloud frames. Our experimental results are evaluated using a new benchmark for both SSFE and SPF consisting of synthetic and real datasets. Previously, datasets for scene flow estimation have been limited to two frames. We provide non-trivial extensions to these datasets for multi-frame estimation and prediction. Due to the difficulty of obtaining ground truth motion for real-world datasets, we use self-supervised training and evaluation metrics. We believe that this benchmark will be pivotal to future research in this area. All code for benchmark and models will be made accessible at (https://github.com/BestSonny/SPCM).

AB Neuronal ensembles within the infralimbic cortex (IL) and their projections to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) mediate opiate seeking in well-trained rats. However, it is unclear how early this circuitry is recruited during oxycodone self-administration. Here, we used retrograde labelling (CTb) and immunohistochemistry to identify NAc-projecting neurons in the IL that were activated during initial oxycodone seeking. Next, we sought to determine the role of IL neuronal ensembles in initial oxycodone self-administration. We used the Daun02 procedure in male and female Fos-LacZ rats to chemogenetically inactivate IL Fos-expressing neurons at different time points in oxycodone self-administration training: immediately after meeting criteria for acquisition of behaviour and following nine daily sessions with increasing schedules of reinforcement (FR1, FR2 and FR3) in which rats demonstrated stable oxycodone intake under increasing effort to self-administer. We found that Daun02 infusions attenuated oxycodone seeking at both the initial learning and well-trained time points. These results suggest that IL neuronal ensembles are formed during initial learning of oxycodone self-administration and required for the maintenance and expression of oxycodone seeking.

TI Prediction of left ventricular ejection fraction changes in heart
   failure patients using machine learning and electronic health records: a
   multi-site study
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
ID OUTCOMES; IMPROVEMENT
AB Left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) is a key measure in the diagnosis and treatment of heart failure (HF) and many patients experience changes in EF overtime. Large-scale analysis of longitudinal changes in EF using electronic health records (EHRs) is limited. In a multi-site retrospective study using EHR data from three academic medical centers, we investigated longitudinal changes in EF measurements in patients diagnosed with HF. We observed significant variations in baseline characteristics and longitudinal EF change behavior of the HF cohorts from a previous study that is based on HF registry data. Data gathered from this longitudinal study were used to develop multiple machine learning models to predict changes in ejection fraction measurements in HF patients. Across all three sites, we observed higher performance in predicting EF increase over a 1-year duration, with similarly higher performance predicting an EF increase of 30% from baseline compared to lower percentage increases. In predicting EF decrease we found moderate to high performance with low confidence for various models. Among various machine learning models, XGBoost was the best performing model for predicting EF changes. Across the three sites, the XGBoost model had an F1-score of 87.2, 89.9, and 88.6 and AUC of 0.83, 0.87, and 0.90 in predicting a 30% increase in EF, and had an F1-score of 95.0, 90.6, 90.1 and AUC of 0.54, 0.56, 0.68 in predicting a 30% decrease in EF. Among features that contribute to predicting EF changes, baseline ejection fraction measurement, age, gender, and heart diseases were found to be statistically significant.

TI A deep learning-based dynamic model for predicting acute kidney injury
   risk severity in postoperative patients
SO SURGERY
LA English
DT Article
ID VARIABILITY
AB Background: Acute kidney injury is a common postoperative complication affecting between 10% and 30% of surgical patients. Acute kidney injury is associated with increased resource usage and chronic kidney disease development, with more severe acute kidney injury suggesting more aggressive deterioration in clinical outcomes and mortality.Methods: We considered 42,906 surgical patients admitted to University of Florida Health (n 1/4 51,806) between 2014 and 2021. Acute kidney injury stages were determined using the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes serum creatinine criteria. We developed a recurrent neural network-based model to continuously predict acute kidney injury risk and state in the following 24 hours and compared it with logistic regression, random forest, and multi-layer perceptron models. We used medications, laboratory and vital measurements, and derived features from past one-year records as inputs. We analyzed the proposed model with integrated gradients for enhanced explainability.Results: Postoperative acute kidney injury at any stage developed in 20% (10,664) of the cohort. The recurrent neural network model was more accurate in predicting nearly all categories of next-day acute kidney injury stages (including the no acute kidney injury group). The area under the receiver operating curve and 95% confidence intervals for recurrent neural network and logistic regression models were for no acute kidney injury (0.98 [0.98-0.98] vs 0.93 [0.93-0.93]), stage 1 (0.95 [0.95-0.95] vs. 0.81 [0.80-0.82]), stage 2/3 (0.99 [0.99-0.99] vs 0.96 [0.96-0.97]), and stage 3 with renal replacement therapy (1.0 [1.0-1.0] vs 1.0 [1.0-1.0].Conclusion: The proposed model demonstrates that temporal processing of patient information can lead to more granular and dynamic modeling of acute kidney injury status and result in more continuous and accurate acute kidney injury prediction. We showcase the integrated gradients framework's utility as a mechanism for enhancing model explainability, potentially facilitating clinical trust for future implementation.& COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) show significant potential in medical applications but are hindered by limited specialized medical knowledge. We present Me-LLaMA, a family of open-source medical LLMs integrating extensive domain-specific knowledge with robust instruction-following capabilities. Me-LLaMA is developed through continual pretraining and instruction tuning of LLaMA2 models using diverse biomedical and clinical data sources (e.g., biomedical literature and clinical notes). We evaluated Me-LLaMA on six text analysis tasks using 12 benchmarks (e.g., PubMedQA and MIMIC-CXR) and assessed its clinical utility in complex case diagnosis through automatic and human evaluations. Me-LLaMA outperforms existing open medical LLMs in zero-shot and supervised settings and surpasses ChatGPT and GPT-4 after task-specific instruction tuning for most text analysis tasks. Its performance is also comparable to ChatGPT and GPT-4 for diagnosing complex clinical cases. Our findings highlight the importance of combining domain-specific continual pretraining with instruction tuning to enhance performance in medical LLMs.

AB Dogs can be trained to reliably detect a wide variety of odors. Little scientific research, however, has been published on the rate at which dogs can learn to detect an odor, the variables influencing this rate, and how this rate may vary across dogs. In two experiments, we developed a procedure that allows the study of individual differences in the acquisition of an odor detection task in dogs. We demonstrate that differential reinforcement can be used to train a rooting response in a bin under the control of a novel odorant in discrete trials. In initial testing, we showed that as a group, twenty dogs performed significantly above chance within 24 trials, with two dogs meeting an individual criterion for above chance performance. In a follow-up experiment, we compared burying accessible food inside the target bin (with inaccessible food in the non-target bin) to the experimenter delivering food by hand following correct responses. We assessed the effect of this procedural variation on both an odor discrimination and a visual discrimination. Dogs learned faster on the odor task when the experimenter delivered food, compared to when food was placed directly in the bins. Performance on the visual task was lower than on the odor task and was unaffected by how food was delivered. Our discrete-trials procedure with experimenter-delivered food may be a useful method to study rapid acquisition of an odor-detection in dogs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

ID SPECIES DISTRIBUTION; CLIMATE SURFACES
AB Amorphophallus titanum is endemic to Sumatera and increasingly threatened in the wild by unsustainable harvesting, rapidly changing land cover, and global climate change. Management of this species requires better information on the habitat requirements, its population status and spatially explicit assessments of risk factors. Field surveys and historical records were used to characterize the distribution of A. titanum in Sumatera. Habitats were characterized using topography, soils, climate and land cover variables. An ensemble machine learning model using Random Forest and Artificial Neural Network techniques found that slope and distance to the nearest river are the two most important variables associated with the occurrence of A. titanum in Sumatera. The plant species associations of A. titanum are very diverse. Soil aeration and good drainage are key factors for the species, both in natural environments and in cultivation. Land cover change and climate change scenarios predicted significantly reduced suitable geographic distribution by 2070. Population hot spots were identified in Sumatera Utara (North Sumatera) and the Southern part of Aceh. Potential threats at occurrence points were evaluated using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. Human pressures, particularly harvesting and land conversion, are the main threats to the A. titanum populations. Most of the predicted suitable habitat areas of this species are located outside of conservation areas. Very few mature individuals were found in this study with local populations dominated by seedlings and juveniles. Based on the IUCN criteria, the conservation status of the endemic A. titanum in Sumatera is endangered with criteria EN A2cd+3 C, C2a(i).

AB To address a research gap on how AI can be leveraged to enhance customers' in-store journeys, this study evaluates the effectiveness of an AI-powered conversational decision bot (mobile messaging app) employing two laboratory experiments in a simulated store. Study 1 revealed that consumers found in-store shopping to be more enjoyable and effortful with a decision bot than without, demonstrating that these bots reinforce consumers' instore hedonic and utilitarian experiences. Study 2 evaluated the effectiveness of two types of decision bots (attribute- vs. alternative-based), revealing that consumers' perceived usefulness and reuse/recommend intentions for the bot were higher when using an attribute- as compared to an alternative-based bot. When shopping in-store, consumers benefit from a decision bot that retrieves attribute-level information for the product category rather than one that focuses on single product alternatives. This study makes important theoretical contributions to constructive decision theory, the Elaboration Likelihood Model, and language-based adaptive intelligence.

AB The study's objectives were to identify cow-level and environmental factors associated with metritis cure to predict metritis cure using traditional statistics and machine learning algorithms. The data set used was from a previous study comparing the efficacy of different therapies and self-cure for metritis. Metritis was defined as fetid, watery, reddish-brownish discharge, with or without fever. Cure was defined as an absence of metritis signs 12 d after diagnosis. Cows were randomly allocated to receive a subcutaneous injection of 6.6 mg/kg of ceftiofur crystalline-free acid (Excede, Zoetis) at the day of diagnosis and 3 d later (n = 275); and no treatment at the time of metritis diagnosis (n = 275). The variables days in milk (DIM) at metritis diagnosis, treatment, season of the metritis diagnosis, month of metritis diagnostic, number of lactation, parity, calving score, dystocia, retained fetal membranes, body condition score at d 5 postpartum, vulvovaginal laceration score, the rectal temperature at the metritis diagnosis, fever at diagnosis, milk production from the day before to metritis diagnosis, and milk production slope up to 5, 7, and 9 DIM were offered to univariate logistic regression. Variables included in the multivariable logistic regression model were selected from the univariate analysis according to P-value. Variables were offered to the model to assess the association between these factors and metritis cure. Additionally, the univariate logistic regression variables were offered to a recursive feature elimination to find the optimal subset of features for a machine learning algorithms analysis. Cows without vulvovaginal laceration had 1.91 higher odds of curing of metritis than cows with vulvovaginal laceration. Cows that developed metritis at >7 DIM had 2.09 higher odds of being cured than cows that developed metritis at <7 DIM. For rectal temperature, each degree Celsius above 39.4 degrees C led to lower odds to be cured than cows with rectal temperature <39.4 degrees C. Furthermore, milk production slope and milk production difference from the day before to the metritis diagnosis were essential variables to predict metritis cure. Cows that had reduced milk production from the day before to the metritis diagnosis had lower odds to be cured than cows with moderate milk production increase. The results from the multivariable logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that cows developing metritis at >7 DIM, with increase in milk production, and with a rectal temperature <39.40 degrees C had increased likelihood of cure of metritis with an accuracy of 75%. The machine learning analysis showed that in addition to these variables, calving-related disorders, season, and month of metritis event were needed to predict whether the cow will cure or not from metritis with an accuracy >= 70% and F1 score (harmonic mean between precision and recall) >= 0.78. Although machine learning algorithms are acknowledged as powerful tools for predictive classification, the current study was unable to replicate its potential benefits. More research is needed to optimize predictive models of metritis cure.

AB Introduction Postoperative urinary retention (POUR) is the inability to urinate after a surgical procedure despite having a full bladder. It is a common complication following lumbar spine surgery which has been extensively linked to increased patient morbidity and hospital costs. This study hopes to development and validate a predictive model for POUR following lumbar spine surgery using patient demographics, surgical and anesthesia variables.Methods This is a retrospective observational cohort study of 903 patients who underwent lumbar spine surgery over the period of June 2017 to June 2019 in a tertiary academic medical center. Four hundred and nineteen variables were collected including patient demographics, ICD-10 codes, and intraoperative factors. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operation (LASSO) regression and logistic regression models were compared. A decision tree model was fitted to the optimal model to classify each patient's risk of developing POUR as high, intermediate, or low risk. Predictive performance of POUR was assessed by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC).Results 903 patients were included with average age 60 +/- 15 years, body mass index of 30.5 +/- 6.4 kg/m2, 476 (53%) male, 785 (87%) white, 446 (49%) involving fusions, with average 2.1 +/- 2.0 levels. The incidence of POUR was 235 (26%) with 63 (7%) requiring indwelling catheter placement. A decision tree was constructed with an accuracy of 87.8%.Conclusion We present a highly accurate and easy to implement decision tree model which predicts POUR following lumbar spine surgery using preoperative and intraoperative variables.

SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

ID GOLD STANDARD
AB Spaceflight has several detrimental effects on human and rodent health. For example, liver dysfunction is a common phenotype observed in space-flown rodents, and this dysfunction is partially reflected in transcriptomic changes. Studies linking transcriptomics with liver dysfunction rely on tools which exploit correlation, but these tools make no attempt to disambiguate true correlations from spurious ones. In this work, we use a machine learning ensemble of causal inference methods called the Causal Research and Inference Search Platform (CRISP) which was developed to predict causal features of a binary response variable from high-dimensional input. We used CRISP to identify genes robustly correlated with a lipid density phenotype using transcriptomic and histological data from the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR). Our approach identified genes and molecular targets not predicted by previous traditional differential gene expression analyses. These genes are likely to play a pivotal role in the liver dysfunction observed in space-flown rodents, and this work opens the door to identifying novel countermeasures for space travel.

AB Graph clustering, i.e., partitioning nodes or data points into non-overlapping clusters, can be beneficial in a large varieties of computer vision and machine learning applications. However, main graph clustering schemes, such as spectral clustering, cannot be applied to a large network due to prohibitive computational complexity required. While there exist methods applicable to large networks, these methods do not offer convincing comparisons against known ground truth. For the first time, this work conducts clustering algorithm performance evaluations on large networks (consisting of one million nodes) with ground truth information. Ideas and concepts from game theory are applied towards graph clustering to formulate a new proposed algorithm, Game Theoretical Approach for Clustering (GTAC). This theoretical framework is shown to be a generalization of both the Label Propagation and Louvain methods, offering an additional means of derivation and analysis. GTAC introduces a tuning parameter which allows variable algorithm performance in accordance with application needs. Experimentation shows that these GTAC algorithms offer scalability and tunability towards big data applications.

AB Although endometrial cancer is often diagnosed at an early curable stage, the incidence and mortality from endometrial cancer is rising and minority women are particularly at risk. We hypothesize that delays in clinical presentation contribute to racial disparities in endometrial cancer mortality and treatment-related morbidity. Improved methods for endometrial cancer risk assessment and distinguishing abnormal uterine bleeding and postmenopausal bleeding from physiologic variation are needed. Accordingly, we propose a multipronged strategy that combines innovative patient education with novel early detection strategies to reduce health impacts of endometrial cancer and its precursors, especially among Black women. Futuristic approaches using gamification, smartphone apps, artificial intelligence, and health promotion outside of the physical clinic hold promise in preventing endometrial cancer and reducing morbidity and mortality related to the disease, but they also raise a number of questions that will need to be addressed by future research.

AB Colorectal cancer is considered one of the deadliest diseases, contributing to an alarming increase in annual deaths worldwide, with colorectal polyps recognized as precursors to this malignancy. Early and accurate detection of these polyps is crucial for reducing the mortality rate of colorectal cancer. However, the manual detection of polyps is a time-consuming process and requires the expertise of trained medical professionals. Moreover, it often misses polyps due to their varied size, color, and texture. Computer-aided diagnosis systems offer potential improvements, but they often struggle with precision in complex visual environments. This study presents an enhanced deep learning approach using encoder-decoder architecture for colorectal polyp segmentation to capture and utilize complex feature representations. Our approach introduces an enhanced dual attention mechanism, combining spatial and channel-wise attention to focus precisely on critical features. Channel-wise attention, implemented via an optimized Squeeze-and-Excitation (S&E) block, allows the network to capture comprehensive contextual information and interrelationships among different channels, ensuring a more refined feature selection process. The experimental results showed that the proposed model achieved a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.9054 and 0.9277, a dice coefficient of 0.9006 and 0.9128, a precision of 0.8985 and 0.9517, a recall of 0.9190 and 0.9094, and an accuracy of 0.9806 and 0.9907 on the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets, respectively. Moreover, the proposed model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art resulting in improved patient outcomes with the potential to enhance the early detection of colorectal polyps.

AB Sensory ecology provides a conceptual framework for considering how animals ought to design sensory systems to capture meaningful information from their environments. The framework has been particularly successful at describing how one should allocate sensory receptors to maximize performance on a given task. Neural networks, in contrast, have made unique contributions to understanding how 'hidden preferences' can emerge as a by-product of sensory design. The two frameworks comprise complementary techniques for understanding the design and the evolution of sensation. This article reviews empirical literature from multiple modalities and levels of sensory processing, considering vision, audition and touch from the viewpoints of sensory ecology and neuroethology. In the process, it presents modifications of extant neural network algorithms that would allow a more effective integration of these diverse approaches. Together, the reviewed literature suggests important advances that can be made by explicitly formulating neural network models in terms of sensory ecology, by incorporating neural costs into models of perceptual evolution and by exploring how such demands interact with historical forces.

AB Tuberculosis (TB) is among the leading causes of death worldwide from a single infectious agent. This disease usually affects the lungs (pulmonary TB) and can be cured in most cases with a quick diagnosis and proper treatment. Microscopic sputum smear is widely used to diagnose and manage pulmonary TB. Despite being relatively fast and low cost, it can be exhausting because it depends on manually counting TB bacilli (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) in microscope images. In this context, different Deep Learning (DL) techniques are proposed in the literature to assist in performing smear microscopy. This article presents a systematic review based on the PRISMA procedure, which investigates which DL techniques can contribute to classifying TB bacilli in microscopic images of sputum smears using the Ziehl-Nielsen method. After an extensive search and a careful inclusion/exclusion procedure, 28 papers were selected from a total of 400 papers retrieved from nine databases. Based on these articles, the DL techniques are presented as possible solutions to improve smear microscopy. The main concepts necessary to understand how such techniques are proposed and used are also presented. In addition, replication work is also carried out, verifying reproducibility and comparing different works in the literature. In this review, we look at how DL techniques can be a partner to make sputum smear microscopy faster and more efficient. We also identify some gaps in the literature that can guide which issues can be addressed in other works to contribute to the practical use of these methods in laboratories.

AB There is little empirical research related to how elementary students develop computational thinking (CT) and how they apply CT in problem-solving. To address this gap in knowledge, this study made use of learning trajectories (LTs; hypothesized learning goals, progressions, and activities) in CT concept areas such as sequence, repetition, conditionals, and decomposition to better understand students' CT. This study implemented eight math-CT integrated lessons aligned to U.S. national mathematics education standards and the LTs with third- and fourth-grade students. This basic interpretive qualitative study aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of elementary students' CT by having students express and articulate their CT in cognitive interviews. Participants' (n = 22) CT articulation was examined using a priori codes translated verbatim from the learning goals in the LTs and was mapped to the learning goals in the LTs. Results revealed a range of students' CT in problem-solving, such as using precise and complete problem-solving instructions, recognizing repeating patterns, and decomposing arithmetic problems. By collecting empirical data on how students expressed and articulated their CT, this study makes theoretical contributions by generating initial empirical evidence to support the hypothesized learning goals and progressions in the LTs. This article also discusses the implications for integrated CT instruction and assessments at the elementary level.

AB Construction projects' unsatisfactory performance has been linked to factors influencing individuals' well-being and mental alertness on projects. Drowsiness is a significant indicator of sleep deprivation and fatigue, so being able to identify the cognitive and physical preparedness of workers on site to engage in construction tasks is important. As a consequence of the strenuous nature of the work involved in construction, long work hours, and environmental conditions, drowsiness is commonplace and has received less attention despite being a leading cause of accidents occurring on-site. Detecting drowsiness is essential for determining the safety and well-being of site workers. This study presents a vision-based approach using an improved version of the You Only Look Once (YOLOv8) algorithm for real-time drowsiness exposure among construction workers. The proposed method leverages computer vision techniques to analyze facial and eye features, enabling the early detection of signs of drowsiness, effectively preventing accidents, and enhancing on-site safety. The model showed significant precision and efficiency in detecting drowsiness from the given dataset, accomplishing a drowsiness class with a mean average precision (mAP) of 92%. However, it also exhibited difficulties handling imbalanced classes, particularly the underrepresented 'Awake with PPE' class, which was detected with high precision but comparatively lower recall and mAP. This highlighted the necessity of balanced datasets for optimal deep learning performance. The YOLOv8 model's average mAP of 78% in drowsiness detection compared favorably with other studies employing different methodologies. The system improves productivity and reduces costs by preventing accidents and enhancing worker safety. However, limitations, such as sensitivity to lighting conditions and occlusions, must be addressed in future iterations.

AB In the Monty Hall Dilemma (MHD), three doors are presented with a prize behind one and participants are instructed to choose a door. One of the unchosen doors not containing the prize is revealed, following which the participant can choose to stay with their chosen door or switch to the other one. The optimal strategy is to switch. Herbranson and Schroeder (2010) found that humans performed poorly on this task, whereas pigeons learned to switch readily. We found that pigeons performed only slightly better than humans and that pigeons stayed nearly exclusively when staying and switching were reinforced equally and when staying was the optimal strategy (Stagner et al., 2013b). In Experiment 1 of the present research, rats were trained under these same conditions to observe if possible differences in foraging strategy would influence performance on this task. In Experiment 2, pigeons were trained in an analogous procedure to better compare the two species. We found that both species were sensitive to the overall probability of reinforcement, as both switched significantly more often than subjects that were reinforced equally for staying and switching or reinforced more often for staying. Overall, the two species performed very similarly within the parameters of the current procedure. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The augmented-neural-network (AugNN) approach has been applied lately to some NP-Hard combinatorial problems, such as task scheduling, open-shop scheduling and resource-constraint project scheduling. In this approach the problem of search in the solution-space is transformed to a search in a weight-matrix space, much like in a neural-network approach. Some weight adjustment strategies are then used to converge to a good set of weights for a locally optimal solution. While empirical results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the AugNN approach vis-A -vis a few other metaheuristics, little theoretical insights exist which justify this approach and explain the effectiveness thereof. This paper provides some theoretical insights and justification for the AugNN approach through some basic theorems and also describes the algorithm and the formulation with the help of examples.

AB Communication delays and synchronization are major bottlenecks for parallel computing, and tolerating asynchrony is therefore crucial for accelerating parallel computation. Motivated by optimization problems that do not satisfy convexity assumptions, we present an asynchronous block coordinate descent algorithm for nonconvex optimization problems whose objective functions satisfy the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition. This condition is a generalization of strong convexity to nonconvex problems and requires neither convexity nor uniqueness of minimizers. Under only assumptions of mild smoothness of objective functions and bounded delays, we prove that a linear convergence rate is obtained. Numerical experiments for logistic regression problems are presented to illustrate the impact of asynchrony upon convergence.

AB The distribution of the apparent 3D shape of human faces across the view-sphere is complex, owing to factors such as variations in identity, facial expression, minor occlusions and noise. In this paper, we use the technique of support vector regression on wavelet sub-bands to learn a model relating facial shape (obtained from 3D scanners) to 3D pose in an identity-invariant manner. The proposed method yields an estimation accuracy of 97-99% within an error of +/- 9 degrees on a large set of data obtained from two different sources. The method could be used for pose estimation in a view-invariant face recognition system. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Observing vegetation dynamics and determining optimum conditions for tree species are important for the long-term habitat conservation. In this study we evaluate the environmental drivers that may explain the development and geographic distribution of Pistacia atlantica Desf. (wild pistachio) in Northeastern Iran. The study uses seven machine learning models to predict the habitats of P. atlantica: multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), flexible discriminant analysis (FDA), boosted regression tree (BRT), maximum entropy (MaxEnt), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), generalized linear model (GLM), and their ensembles (ESMs). In total, 1477 P. atlantica sites were identified, described and mapped. The most relevant determinants of the species habitat were included as 28 bioclimatic, topographic, edaphic, and geologic components. While all the models returned high accuracies, the ESMs achieved the highest AUC, TSS, and Kappa values, suggesting a good predictive performance. The most important parameters explaining the species habitat were found to be the mean diurnal temperature range, annual precipitation and slope. These results support the higher performance of ESMs to predict the spatial distribution of P. atlantica. In turn, this model may support species conservation and decision -making at the regional and national levels.

AB This paper applies artificial neural network to predict hourly air pollutant concentrations near an arterial in Guangzhou, China. Factors that influence Pollutant concentrations are classified into four categories: traffic-related, background concentration, meteorological and geographical. The hourly averages of these influential factors and concentrations of carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, particular matter and ozone were measured at three selected sites near the arterial using vehicular automatic monitoring equipments. Models based on back-propagation neural network were trained, validated and tested using the collected data. It is demonstrated that the models are able to produce accurate prediction of hourly concentrations of the pollutants respectively more than 10 h in advance. A comparison study shows that the neural network models outperform multiple linear regression models and the California line source dispersion model. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The combination of the famed kernel trick and a. ne projection algorithms (APAs) yields powerful nonlinear extensions, named collectively here, KAPA. This paper is a follow-up study of the recently introduced kernel least-mean-square algorithm (KLMS). KAPA inherits the simplicity and online nature of KLMS while reducing its gradient noise, boosting performance. More interestingly, it provides a unifying model for several neural network techniques, including kernel least-mean-square algorithms, kernel adaline, sliding-window kernel recursive-least squares (KRLS), and regularization networks. Therefore, many insights can be gained into the basic relations among them and the tradeo. between computation complexity and performance. Several simulations illustrate its wide applicability.

AB Assessing gastrointestinal motility lacks simultaneous evaluation of intraluminal pressure (ILP), circular muscle (CM) and longitudinal muscle (LM) contraction, and lumen emptying. In this study, a sophisticated machine was developed that synchronized real-time recordings to quantify the intricate interplay between CM and LM contractions, and their timings for volume changes using high-resolution cameras with machine learning capability, the ILP using pressure transducers and droplet discharge (DD) using droplet counters. Results revealed four distinct phases, BPhase, NPhase, DPhase, and APhase, distinguished by pressure wave amplitudes. Fluid filling impacted LM strength and contraction frequency initially, followed by CM contraction affecting ILP, volume, and the extent of anterograde, retrograde, and segmental contractions during these phases that result in short or long duration DD. This comprehensive analysis sheds light on peristalsis mechanisms, understand their sequence and how one parameter influenced the other, offering insights for managing peristalsis by regulating smooth muscle contractions.

AB The positioning of vehicular live loads on a bridge superstructure to achieve the maximum force effects in the bridge pier is an important design issue. For highway bridges, the worst load positioning for the superstructure design usually does not produce the worst force effects for the pier design. As a result, the correct positioning of the loads for the pier is left to engineering judgment. This paper investigates an implementation of neural networks to predict the worst load positioning for the bridge pier. The networks predict the load positioning for both single and multiple column piers given input parameters that describe the pier and bridge configuration. The procedure presented herein is intended to offer an alternative to the trial and error load positioning method used by many practicing engineers. (C) 2004 Civil-Comp Ltd and Elsevier Ltd.

AB In this paper, we consider the classification problem within the multiple instance learning (MIL) context. Training data is composed of labeled bags of instances. Despite the large number of margin maximization based classification methods, there are only a few methods that consider the margin for MIL problems in the literature. We first formulate a combinatorial margin maximization problem for multiple instance classification and prove that it is NP-hard. We present a way to apply the kernel trick in this formulation for classifying nonlinear multiple instance data. We also propose a branch and bound algorithm and present computational results on publicly available benchmark data sets. Our approach outperforms a leading commercial solver in terms of the best integer solution and optimality gap in the majority of image annotation and molecular activity prediction test cases.

AB The purpose of this paper is to stimulate interest within the civil engineering research community for developing the next generation of applied artificial neural networks. In particular, it identifies what the next generation of these devices needs to achieve, and provides direction in terms of how their development may proceed. An analysis of the current situation indicates that progress in the development of artificial neural network applications has largely stagnated. Suggestions are made for advancing the field to the next level of sophistication and application, using genetic algorithms and related techniques. It is shown that this approach will require the design of some very sophisticated genetic coding mechanisms in order to develop the required higher-order network structures, and will utilize development mechanisms observed in nature such as growth, self-organization, and multi-stage objective functions. The capabilities of such an approach and the way in which they can be achieved are explored with reference to the problems of. (a) determining truck attributes from the strain envelopes they induce in structural members when crossing a bridge, and; (b) developing a decision support system for dynamic control of industrialized manufacturing of houses.

ID FRAMEWORK
AB Although having achieved great success in medical image segmentation, deep learning-based approaches usually require large amounts of well-annotated data, which can be extremely expensive in the field of medical image analysis. Unlabeled data, on the other hand, is much easier to acquire. Semi-supervised learning and unsupervised domain adaptation both take the advantage of unlabeled data, and they are closely related to each other. In this paper, we propose uncertainty-aware multi-view co-training (UMCT), a unified framework that addresses these two tasks for volumetric medical image segmentation. Our framework is capable of efficiently utilizing unlabeled data for better performance. We firstly rotate and permute the 3D volumes into multiple views and train a 3D deep network on each view. We then apply co-training by enforcing multi-view consistency on unlabeled data, where an uncertainty estimation of each view is utilized to achieve accurate labeling. Experiments on the NIH pancreas segmentation dataset and a multi-organ segmentation dataset show state-of-the-art performance of the proposed framework on semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Under unsupervised domain adaptation settings, we validate the effectiveness of this work by adapting our multi-organ segmentation model to two pathological organs from the Medical Segmentation Decathlon Datasets. Additionally, we show that our UMCT-DA model can even effectively handle the challenging situation where labeled source data is inaccessible, demonstrating strong potentials for real-world applications.

TI Profiling of Fusarium head blight resistance QTL haplotypes

LA English
DT Article
ID WINTER-WHEAT; VALIDATION
AB Key message Marker-assisted selection is important for cultivar development. We propose a system where a training population genotyped for QTL and genome-wide markers may predict QTL haplotypes in early development germplasm. Breeders screen germplasm with molecular markers to identify and select individuals that have desirable haplotypes. The objective of this research was to investigate whether QTL haplotypes can be accurately predicted using SNPs derived by genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). In the SunGrains program during 2020 (SG20) and 2021 (SG21), 1,536 and 2,352 lines submitted for GBS were genotyped with markers linked to the Fusarium head blight QTL: Qfhb.nc-1A, Qfhb.vt-1B, Fhb1, and Qfhb.nc-4A. In parallel, data were compiled from the 2011-2020 Southern Uniform Winter Wheat Scab Nursery (SUWWSN), which had been screened for the same QTL, sequenced via GBS, and phenotyped for: visual Fusarium severity rating (SEV), percent Fusarium damaged kernels (FDK), deoxynivalenol content (DON), plant height, and heading date. Three machine learning models were evaluated: random forest, k-nearest neighbors, and gradient boosting machine. Data were randomly partitioned into training-testing splits. The QTL haplotype and 100 most correlated GBS SNPs were used for training and tuning of each model. Trained machine learning models were used to predict QTL haplotypes in the testing partition of SG20, SG21, and the total SUWWSN. Mean disease ratings for the observed and predicted QTL haplotypes were compared in the SUWWSN. For all models trained using the SG20 and SG21, the observed Fhb1 haplotype estimated group means for SEV, FDK, DON, plant height, and heading date in the SUWWSN were not significantly different from any of the predicted Fhb1 calls. This indicated that machine learning may be utilized in breeding programs to accurately predict QTL haplotypes in earlier generations.

TI A New "Cult of the Offensive?" Elite Perceptions of Artificial
   Intelligence in Military Affairs in the United States and the People's
   Republic of China
SO FOREIGN POLICY ANALYSIS
LA English
DT Article
ID DEFENSE; GERMANY; BALANCE
AB The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in military affairs is largely limited to logistics, transport, reconnaissance, and other support functions at present. Yet, the United States and the People's Republic of China (PRC) are also making significant progress in developing autonomous combat vehicles and other offensive applications of AI. The ambiguous nature and multifaceted applications of AI in military affairs could be seen as either increasing or decreasing the relative cost of offensive military action. The critical question, therefore, is not a technical determination of whether the emerging uses of AI favor the offensive or defensive force, but rather an assessment of how AI is perceived by policymakers. Similar to the World War I era cult of the offensive, ambiguous emerging technology may drive leaders to focus on the offensive advantages of that technology when expectations of conflict are rising. This paper examines the policy elite discourse surrounding the military applications of AI in both the United States and the PRC between 2014 and 2022. It finds that over this period, elite discussion of the use of AI in military affairs has shifted in both states in ways that indicate more focus on the offensive rather than defensive applications of this emerging technology. While by no means determinative, it is an indicator that perceptions of the offense-defense balance may be moving in a destabilizing direction.
   Actuellement, l'utilisation de l'intelligence artificielle (IA) dans les affaires militaires se limite surtout & agrave; la logistique, au transport, & agrave; la reconnaissance et & agrave; d'autres fonctions support. Pourtant, les & Eacute;tats-Unis et la R & eacute;publique populaire de Chine (RPC) effectuent & eacute;galement des progr & egrave;s non n & eacute;gligeables dans le d & eacute;veloppement de v & eacute;hicules de combat autonomes et d'autres applications offensives de l'IA. L'on pourrait penser que la nature ambigu & euml; et les applications aux multiples facettes de l'IA dans les affaires militaires augmenteraient ou diminueraient le co & ucirc;t relatif de l'action militaire offensive. Aussi est-il d & eacute;cisif non pas de d & eacute;terminer sur le plan technique si les utilisations & eacute;mergentes de l'IA favorisent la force offensive ou d & eacute;fensive, mais plut & ocirc;t d'& eacute;valuer la perception de l'IA par les d & eacute;cideurs politiques. & Agrave; l'instar du culte offensif de la p & eacute;riode de la Premi & egrave;re Guerre mondiale, les technologies & eacute;mergentes ambigu & euml;s peuvent pousser les dirigeants & agrave; se focaliser sur les avantages offensifs de ces technologies quand la possibilit & eacute; d'un conflit augmente. Cet article examine le discours des & eacute;lites politiques concernant les applications militaires de l'IA tant aux & Eacute;tats-Unis qu'en RPC entre 2014 et 2022. Il conclut que durant cette p & eacute;riode, la discussion des & eacute;lites quant & agrave; l'utilisation de l'IA dans les affaires militaires a & eacute;volu & eacute; dans les deux & Eacute;tats d'une fa & ccedil;on qui indique une concentration croissante sur les applications offensives plut & ocirc;t que d & eacute;fensives de cette technologie & eacute;mergente. Bien que nullement d & eacute;terminant, il s'agit d'un indicateur que les perceptions de l'& eacute;quilibre Attaque/D & eacute;fense pourraient tendre dans une direction d & eacute;stabilisatrice.
   En la actualidad, el uso de la inteligencia artificial (IA) en el & aacute;mbito militar est & aacute; limitado, en gran medida, a la log & iacute;stica, al transporte, al reconocimiento y a otras funciones auxiliares. Sin embargo, tanto Estados Unidos como la Rep & uacute;blica Popular China (RPCh) tambi & eacute;n est & aacute;n llevando a cabo progresos significativos con respecto al desarrollo de veh & iacute;culos de combate aut & oacute;nomos y a otras aplicaciones de car & aacute;cter ofensivo que puede ofrecer la IA. Tanto esta naturaleza ambigua como las aplicaciones multifac & eacute;ticas que ofrece la IA en el & aacute;mbito militar pueden considerarse como un aumento o una disminuci & oacute;n del coste relativo de la acci & oacute;n militar ofensiva. En consecuencia, la cuesti & oacute;n relevante no es una determinaci & oacute;n de car & aacute;cter t & eacute;cnico en materia de si los usos emergentes de la IA favorecen la fuerza ofensiva o la defensiva, sino m & aacute;s bien un an & aacute;lisis de c & oacute;mo los responsables pol & iacute;ticos perciben la IA. Al igual que sucedi & oacute; con el culto a la ofensiva que tuvo lugar durante la era de la Primera Guerra Mundial, la ambigua tecnolog & iacute;a emergente puede llevar a los l & iacute;deres a centrarse en las ventajas ofensivas de esa tecnolog & iacute;a cuando las expectativas de que tenga lugar un conflicto est & aacute;n aumentando. Este art & iacute;culo estudia el discurso por parte de la & eacute;lite pol & iacute;tica con respecto a las aplicaciones militares de la IA tanto en EE. UU. como en la RPCh entre 2014 y 2022. El art & iacute;culo concluye que, durante este per & iacute;odo, el debate que tuvo lugar entre las & eacute;lites con respecto al uso de la IA en el & aacute;mbito militar ha cambiado en ambos Estados de manera que indica que ha habido un mayor enfoque sobre las aplicaciones ofensivas que sobre las aplicaciones defensivas de esta tecnolog & iacute;a emergente. Si bien esto no es, de ninguna manera, determinante, es un indicador de que las percepciones del equilibrio entre ataque y defensa pueden estar movi & eacute;ndose en una direcci & oacute;n desestabilizadora.

ID REGRESSION-ANALYSIS; CONSUMPTION; PREDICTION
AB Global warming is expected to increase 1.5 degrees C between 2030 and 2052. This may lead to an increase in building energy consumption. With the changing climate, university campuses need to prepare to mitigate risks with building energy forecasting models. Although many scholars have developed buildings energy models (BEMs), only a few have focused on the interpretation of the meaning of BEM, including climate change and its impacts. Additionally, despite several review papers on BEMs, there is no comprehensive guideline indicating which variables are appropriate to use to explain building energy consumption. This study developed building energy prediction models by using statistical analysis: multivariate regression models, multiple linear regression (MLR) models, and relative importance analysis. The outputs are electricity (ELC) and steam (STM) consumption. The independent variables used as inputs are building characteristics, temporal variables, and meteorological variables. Results showed that categorizing the campus buildings by building type is critical, and the equipment power density is the most important factor for ELC consumption, while the heating degree is the most critical factor for STM consumption. The laboratory building type is the most STM-consumed building type, so it needs to be monitored closely. The prediction models give an insight into which building factors remain essential and applicable to campus building policy and campus action plans. Increasing STM is to raise awareness of the severity of climate change through future weather scenarios.

AB In this research, the design of teaching and learning with web-enabled technologies, such as iPads, in 64 one-to-one (1:1) Nordic classrooms was explored using the Digital Didactical Design (DDD) framework. DDD focuses on both teachers' activities and students' learning activities in the classroom and how web-enabled technologies are integrated into teaching, learning, and assessment. Semi-structured classroom observations were conducted to investigate how teachers apply the elements of DDD in their classroom practice, and what kinds of learning they support. The analysis resulted in three clusters: Cluster A demonstrates integration and alignment toward meaningful learning; Cluster B shows the potential for deep learning but a semi-alignment of teaching, learning, assessment, roles, and technology; and Cluster C indicates non-integration of the five elements. The findings point out that tablet integration needs the alignment of all five DDD elements to achieve meaningful learning. Pedagogy has to evolve to include new uses of the technology: it is a co-evolutionary growth of the five DDD elements together. DDD can be used by teachers for planning, self-assessment or reflective collaboration with peers and by schools to plan, document, evaluate, and rethink the interwoven pedagogy-technology relationship in tablet classrooms.

AB A discussion forum is a valuable tool to support student learning in online contexts. However, interactions in online discussion forums are sparse, leading to other issues such as low engagement and dropping out. Recent educational studies have examined the affordances of conversational agents (CA) powered by artificial intelligence (AI) to automatically support student participation in discussion forums. However, few studies have paid attention to the safety of CAs. This study aimed to address the safety challenges of CAs constructed with educational big data to support learning. Specifically, we proposed a safety-aware CA model, benchmarked with two state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, to support high school student learning in an online algebra learning platform. We applied automatic text analysis to evaluate the safety and socio-emotional support levels of CA-generated and human-generated texts. A large dataset was used to train and evaluate the CA models, which consisted of all discussion post-reply pairs (n = 2,097,139) by 71,918 online math learners from 2015 to 2021. Results show that while SOTA models can generate supportive texts, their safety is compromised. Meanwhile, our proposed model can effectively enhance the safety of generated texts while providing comparable support.

ID LOGIC LOCKING
AB Reverse engineering (RE) of hardware designs poses a significant threat to the modern distributed electronics supply chain. RE can be performed at both chip and printed circuit board (PCB) levels by using structural, functional, or combined analysis techniques. Recent studies on artificial intelligence (AI)-inspired RE techniques have seen a drastic increase in the effectiveness of such attacks. While various countermeasures, e.g., logic locking (LL) at the chip level and camouflaging at the board level, have been studies to combat RE, the advent of Boolean satisfiability (SAT)-based functional query at chip level and 3-D imaging attacks at board level has shown that these protections can be easily bypassed. We observe that a common factor that contributes to the success of these attacks at both chip and board levels is the ability of an attacker to observe the input/output (I/O) patterns of a working system. Based on this observation, we present a novel locking scheme called that can effectively prevent access to golden I/O behavior of a working system. restricts access to the actual I/Os of the chips in a PCB by introducing a low-overhead key management unit (KMU) that works in conjunction with internal encryption/decryption modules near the I/O ports. The encryption/decryption modules are designed to work with the existing joint test action group (JTAG) infrastructure. can be used in standalone mode or in conjunction with another LL scheme to enhance the overall security of the design. We evaluate the security guarantees offered by theoretically, through simulation, and hardware measurements. We show that provides robust protection against both chip-level and PCB-level RE attacks while incurring minimal design overhead.

AB The muscular dystrophies are made up of a diverse group of rare genetic diseases characterized by progressive loss of muscle strength and muscle damage. Since there is no cure for muscular dystrophy and clinical outcome measures are limited, it is critical to assess the progression of MD objectively. Imaging muscle replacement by fibrofatty tissue has been shown to be a robust biomarker to monitor disease progression in DMD. In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, specific texture patterns are found to correlate to certain MD subtypes and thus present a potential way for automatic assessment. In this paper, we first apply state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to perform accurate MD image classification and then propose an effective visualization method to highlight the important image textures. With a dystrophic MRI dataset, we found that the best CNN model delivers an 91.7% classification accuracy, which significantly outperforms non-deep learning methods, e.g., > 40% improvement has been found over the traditional mean fat fraction (MFF) criterion for DMD and CMD classification. After investigating every single neuron at the top layer of CNN model, we found the superior classification ability of CNN can be explained by its 91 and 118 neurons were performing better than the MFF criterion under the measurements of Euclidean and Chi-square distance, respectively. In order to further interpret CNNs predictions, we tested an improved class activation mapping (ICAM) method to visualize the important regions in the MRI images. With this ICAM, CNNs are able to locate the most discriminative texture patterns of DMD in soleus, lateral gastrocnemius, and medial gastrocnemius; for CMD, the critical texture patterns are highlighted in soleus, tibialis posterior, and peroneus.

   IDENTIFICATION
AB Smart grid (SG) systems are designed to leverage digital automation technologies for monitoring, control and analysis. As SG technology is implemented in increasing number of power systems, SG data becomes increasingly vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Classic analytic physics-model based bad data detection methods may not detect these attacks. Recently, physics-model and data-driven methods have been proposed to use the temporal aspect of the data to learn multivariate statistics of the SG such as mean and covariance matrices of voltages, power flows etc., and then make decisions based on fixed values of these statistics. However, as loads and generation change within a system, these statistics may change rapidly. In this study, an adaptive data-driven anomaly detection framework, Ensemble CorrDet with Adaptive Statistics (ECD-AS), is proposed to detect false data injection cyber-attacks under a constantly changing system state. ECD-AS is tested on the IEEE 118-bus system for 15 different sets of training and test datasets for a variety of current state-of-the-art bad data detection strategies. Experimental results show that the proposed ECD-AS solution outperforms the related strategies due to its unique ability to capture and account for rapidly changing statistics in SG.

AB Objective To (1) develop and evaluate a machine learning model incorporating gait and physical activity to predict medial tibiofemoral cartilage worsening over 2 years in individuals without advanced knee osteoarthritis and (2) identify influential predictors in the model and quantify their effect on cartilage worsening.
   Design An ensemble machine learning model was developed to predict worsened cartilage MRI Osteoarthritis Knee Score at follow-up from gait, physical activity, clinical and demographic data from the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study. Model performance was evaluated in repeated cross-validations. The top 10 predictors of the outcome across 100 held-out test sets were identified by a variable importance measure. Their effect on the outcome was quantified by g-computation.
   Results Of 947 legs in the analysis, 14% experienced medial cartilage worsening at follow-up. The median (2.5-97.5th percentile) area under the receiver operating characteristic curve across the 100 held-out test sets was 0.73 (0.65-0.79). Baseline cartilage damage, higher Kellgren-Lawrence grade, greater pain during walking, higher lateral ground reaction force impulse, greater time spent lying and lower vertical ground reaction force unloading rate were associated with greater risk of cartilage worsening. Similar results were found for the subset of knees with baseline cartilage damage.
   Conclusions A machine learning approach incorporating gait, physical activity and clinical/demographic features showed good performance for predicting cartilage worsening over 2 years. While identifying potential intervention targets from the model is challenging, lateral ground reaction force impulse, time spent lying and vertical ground reaction force unloading rate should be investigated further as potential early intervention targets to reduce medial tibiofemoral cartilage worsening.

AB Since the discovery of steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP), it has been used in many fields. Numerous studies suggest that there exist three SSVEP neural networks in different frequency bands. An obvious phenomenon has been observed, that the amplitude and phase of SSVEP can be modulated by a cognitive task. Previous works have studied this modulation on separately activated SSVEP neural networks by a cognitive task. If two or more SSVEP neural networks are activated simultaneously in the process of a cognitive task, is the modulation on different SSVEP neural networks the same? In this study, two different SSVEP neural networks were activated simultaneously by two different frequency flickers, with a working memory task irrelevant to the flickers being conducted at the same time. The modulated SSVEP waves were compared with each other and to those only under one flicker in previous studies. The comparison results show that the cognitive task can modulate different SSVEP neural networks with a similar style.

AB Compared to the booming industry of AIMDSS, the usage of AIMDSS among healthcare professionals is relatively low in the hospital. Thus, a research on the acceptance and adoption intention of AIMDSS by health professionals is imperative. In this study, an integration of Unified theory of user acceptance of technology and trust theory is proposed for exploring the adoption of AIMDSS. Besides, two groups of additional factors, related to AIMDSS (task complexity, technology characteristics, and perceived substitution crisis) and health professionals' characteristics (propensity to trust and personal innovativeness in IT) are considered in the integrated model. The data set of proposed research model is collected through paper survey and Internet survey in China. The empirical examination demonstrates a high predictive power of this proposed model in explaining AIMDSS adoption. Finally, the theoretical contribution and practical implications of this research are discussed.

AB In response to rising rates of melanoma worldwide, novel noninvasive melanoma detection techniques are emerging to facilitate the early detection of melanoma and decrease unnecessary biopsies of benign pigmented lesions. Because they often report similar study findings, it may be difficult to determine how best to incorporate these technologies into clinical practice based on their supporting studies alone. The first article in this continuing medical education series provides practical advice on how and when to use various noninvasive melanoma detection techniques in clinical practice.

AB We examined how different types of interactions affect psychological sense of community among students in living-learning programs. Distinctions were drawn among 3 types of interactions-academic, social, and deeper life-in which students engage with faculty, staff, and peers. Account-ing for both the type of interaction and the parti-cipants, we found 5 variables that predicted 50% of students' sense of community: academic interactions with peers, social interactions with peers, deeper life interactions with peers, deeper life interactions with faculty/staff, and social interactions with faculty/staff that involve a commitment of time. The results show the meaningful impact that peer interactions have on sense of community. Student interactions with faculty and staff also influence sense of community when they involve time spent together or deal with questions of meaning, value, and purpose. Understanding the impact of interactions on sense of community can help higher education leaders to intentionally design environments that are ultimately conducive to student success.

SO JOURNAL OF PAIN

DE Machine learning; magnetic resonance imaging; self-report; fibromyalgia;
   pain biomarkers
ID BRAIN ACTIVITY; PAIN
AB Recent studies have posited that machine learning (ML) techniques accurately classify individuals with and without pain solely based on neuroimaging data. These studies claim that self-report is unreliable, making "objective" neuroimaging classification methods imperative. However, the relative performance of ML on neuroimaging and self-report data have not been compared. This study used commonly reported ML algorithms to measure differences between "objective" neuroimaging data and "subjective" self-report (ie, mood and pain intensity) in their ability to discriminate between individuals with and without chronic pain. Structural magnetic resonance imaging data from 26 individuals (14 individuals with fibromyalgia and 12 healthy controls) were processed to derive volumes from 56 brain regions per person. Self-report data included visual analog scale ratings for pain intensity and mood (ie, anger, anxiety, depression, frustration, and fear). Separate models representing brain volumes, mood ratings, and pain intensity ratings were estimated across several ML algorithms. Classification accuracy of brain volumes ranged from 53 to 76%, whereas mood and pain intensity ratings ranged from 79 to 96% and 83 to 96%, respectively. Overall, models derived from self-report data outperformed neuroimaging models by an average of 22%. Although neuroimaging clearly provides useful insights for understanding neural mechanisms underlying pain processing, self-report is reliable and accurate and continues to be clinically vital.
   Perspective: The present study compares neuroimaging, self-reported mood, and self-reported pain intensity data in their ability to classify individuals with and without fibromyalgia using ML algorithms. Overall, models derived from self-reported mood and pain intensity data outperformed structural neuroimaging models. (C) 2015 by the American Pain Society

AB Harmful algal blooms are a growing human and environmental health hazard globally. Eco-physiological diversity of the cyanobacteria genera that make up these blooms creates challenges for water managers tasked with controlling the intensity and frequency of blooms, particularly of harmful taxa (e.g., toxin producers, N-2 fixers). Compounding these challenges is the ongoing debate over the efficacy of nutrient management strategies (phosphorus-only versus nitrogen and phosphorus), which increases decision-making uncertainty. To improve our understanding of how different cyanobacteria respond to nutrient levels and other biophysical factors, we analyzed a unique 17 year data set comprising monthly observations of cyanobacteria genera and zooplankton abundances, water quality, and flow in a bloom-impacted, subtropical, flow-through lake in Florida (United States). Using the Random Forests machine learning algorithm, an ensemble modeling approach, we characterized and quantified relationships among environmental conditions and five dominant cyanobacteria genera. Results highlighted nonlinear relationships and critical thresholds between cyanobacteria genera and environmental covariates, the potential for hydrology and temperature to limit the efficacy of cyanobacteria bloom management actions, and the importance of a dual nutrient management strategy for reducing bloom risk in the long term.

AB ObjectivesResearch in criminology and criminal justice is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary, international network of intersecting research topics. Quantifying the substantive content of criminology allows us to empirically disentangle this network and analyze how the interplay of research topic and international context influences knowledge production in the study of crime.MethodsIn this paper we apply the topic embedding model, top2vec, mapping two decades of research in criminology and criminal justice (2001-2020). Using data generated by top2vec we enrich coauthorship network data-introducing themes and subdisciplines, and topical similarity measures-and analyze the relationship between topical and subdisciplinary overlap, geospatial distance, and publication coauthorship in a sample of mid-career researchers (N = 4068).ResultsWe find that these researchers disproportionately favor collaboration within their immediate network of collaborators and subdiscipline of criminology, but tend to establish new, synergistic collaborations with topically adjacent researchers. New collaborations appear to be independent of geographic distance, but US criminologists are less likely to collaborate internationally than Eurasian and Oceanic criminologists.ConclusionsFacilitating communication between researchers and organizations from adjacent subdisciplines could benefit researchers and produce new, innovative research. Encouraging comparative research would help international scholars, many of whom may rely on US collaborators, benefit more from US scholarship. Further applications for top2vec in the scientometric study of criminology, criminal justice, and legal studies are discussed.

AB Non-invasive heart rate estimation is of great importance in daily monitoring of cardiovascular diseases. In this paper, a bidirectional long short term memory (bi-LSTM) regression network is developed for non-invasive heart rate estimation from the ballistocardiograms (BCG) signals. The proposed deep regression model provides an effective solution to the existing challenges in BCG heart rate estimation, such as the mismatch between the BCG signals and ground-truth reference, multi-sensor fusion and effective time series feature learning. Allowing label uncertainty in the estimation can reduce the manual cost of data annotation while further improving the heart rate estimation performance. Compared with the state-of-the-art BCG heart rate estimation methods, the strong fitting and generalization ability of the proposed deep regression model maintains better robustness to noise (e.g., sensor noise) and perturbations (e.g., body movements) in the BCG signals and provides a more reliable solution for long term heart rate monitoring.

AB A real-time deep neural network (DNN) adaptive control architecture is developed for uncertain control-affine nonlinear systems to track a time-varying desired trajectory. A Lyapunov-based analysis is used to develop adaptation laws for the output-layer weights and develop constraints for inner-layer weight adaptation laws. Unlike existing works in neural network and DNN-based control, the developed method establishes a framework to simultaneously update the weights of multiple layers for a DNN of arbitrary depth in real-time. The real-time controller and weight update laws enable the system to track a time-varying trajectory while compensating for unknown drift dynamics and parametric DNN uncertainties. A nonsmooth Lyapunov-based analysis is used to guarantee semi-global asymptotic tracking. Comparative numerical simulation results are included to demonstrate the efficacy of the developed method.

AB In this day and age, there has been a discernible focus on and significant usage of Quantum machine learning (QML) models with the intention of predicting the toxicity of inconsequential compounds. The application of computational toxicity prediction provides considerable advantages in the early phases of pharmaceutical research. These benefits include the identification and removal of compounds that are likely to display poor effectiveness when tested in clinical trials. This trend has been easier to observe with the introduction of extensive toxicity databases. As a result of the fact that this field is still in its infancy, it is essential to acquire a more all-encompassing grasp of the range of QAI approaches and the contexts in which they might be used. Trials to harmonize principles from quantum mechanics, Quantum Machine learning algorithms with classical ML techniques, which leads towards enhancing the interpretability has been performed. In an attempt to achieve robust accuracy associated with the QML model, reach out of enriching insights from naive Bayesian classification and recursive partitioning, through the merge of sophisticated computational techniques with complex biological phenomenon has been done, the present study not only moves towards enhancing the repertoire of tools available for early stage enhanced drug discovery & optimization but also moves towards revolutionary possibilities of quantum-infused methods in tackling persistent issues in the field of bioinformatics and toxicology.

AB Objective: Essential tremor (ET) is a common neurological disorder that has been associated with 60% increased risk of developing dementia. The goals of the present study were to: (a) learn whether individuals with advanced ET symptoms seeking deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery would fall into distinct cognitive subgroups, and (b) learn how empirically derived subgroups map onto criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Method: Patients with ET (N = 201; mean age = 68.9 +/- 8.9 years) undergoing pre-surgical evaluation for DBS completed a multi-domain neurocognitive assessment consisting of memory, executive function, visuospatial skill, language, and processing speed. Two cluster analytic approaches (K-means, hierarchical) were independently conducted to classify cognitive patterns using domain composites. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and proportion of cases meeting neuropsychologically defined criteria for MCI were examined among clusters. Results: A three-cluster solution reflected a Low Executive group (N = 64), Low Memory Multi-Domain group (N = 41), and Cognitively Normal group (N = 96). The Cognitively Normal group was older and more educated, with a higher Dementia Rating Scale-2 score. In total, 27.4% of participants met criteria for MCI. Of the MCI cases, most were in the Low Executive (41.8%) or Low Memory Multi-Domain groups (49.1%). In the latter, 65.9% of its members were classified as MCI versus 35.9% in the Low Executive group. Conclusions: Our study identified three cognitive subtypes of ET patients presenting for DBS. Future work should examine the subgroups for progression to dementia, particularly the Low Memory Multi-Domain subgroup which may be at highest risk.

ID GO
AB Function approximation has experienced significant success in the field of reinforcement learning (RL). Despite a handful of progress on developing theory for nonstationary RL with function approximation under structural assumptions, existing work for nonstationary RL with general function approximation is still limited. In this work, we investigate two different approaches for nonstationary RL with general function approximation: confidence-set based algorithm and UCB-type algorithm. For the first approach, we introduce a new complexity measure called dynamic Bellman Eluder (DBE) for nonstationary MDPs, and then propose a confidence-set based algorithm SW-OPEA based on the complexity metric. SW-OPEA features the sliding window mechanism and a novel confidence set design for nonstationary MDPs. For the second approach, we propose a UCB-type algorithm LSVI-Nonstationary following the popular least-square-value-iteration (LSVI) framework, and mitigate the computational efficiency challenge of the confidence-set based approach. LSVI-Nonstationary features the restart mechanism and a new design of the bonus term to handle nonstationarity. The two proposed algorithms outperform the existing algorithms for nonstationary linear and tabular MDPs in the small variation budget setting. To the best of our knowledge, the two approaches are the first confidence-set based algorithm and UCB-type algorithm in the context of nonstationary MDPs.

   dairy cows
SO ANIMAL MICROBIOME

AB Genetic selection has remarkably helped U.S. dairy farms to decrease their carbon footprint by more than doubling milk production per cow over time. Despite the environmental and economic benefits of improved feed and milk production efficiency, there is a critical need to explore phenotypical variance for feed utilization to advance the long-term sustainability of dairy farms. Feed is a major expense in dairy operations, and their enteric fermentation is a major source of greenhouse gases in agriculture. The challenges to expanding the phenotypic database, especially for feed efficiency predictions, and the lack of understanding of its drivers limit its utilization. Herein, we leveraged an artificial intelligence approach with feature engineering and ensemble methods to explore the predictive power of the rumen microbiome for feed and milk production efficiency traits, as rumen microbes play a central role in physiological responses in dairy cows. The novel ensemble method allowed to further identify key microbes linked to the efficiency measures. We used a population of 454 genotyped Holstein cows in the U.S. and Canada with individually measured feed and milk production efficiency phenotypes. The study underscored that the rumen microbiome is a major driver of residual feed intake (RFI), the most robust feed efficiency measure evaluated in the study, accounting for 36% of its variation. Further analyses showed that several alpha-diversity metrics were lower in more feed-efficient cows. For RFI, [Ruminococcus] gauvreauii group was the only genus positively associated with an improved feed efficiency status while seven other taxa were associated with inefficiency. The study also highlights that the rumen microbiome is pivotal for the unexplained variance in milk fat and protein production efficiency. Estimation of the carbon footprint of these cows shows that selection for better RFI could reduce up to 5 kg of diet consumed per cow daily, potentially reducing up to 37.5% of CH4. These findings shed light that the integration of artificial intelligence approaches, microbiology, and ruminant nutrition can be a path to further advance our understanding of the rumen microbiome on nutrient requirements and lactation performance of dairy cows to support the long-term sustainability of the dairy community.

AB Hallucinations are elusive phenomena that have been associated with psychotic behavior, but that have a high prevalence in healthy population. Some generative mechanisms of Auditory Hallucinations (AH) have been proposed in the literature, but so far empirical evidence is scarce. The most widely accepted generative mechanism hypothesis nowadays consists in the faulty workings of a network of brain areas including the emotional control, the audio and language processing, and the inhibition and self-attribution of the signals in the auditive cortex. In this paper, we consider two methods to analyze resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data, in order to measure effective connections between the brain regions involved in the AH generation process. These measures are the Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) cross-covariance function (CCF) coefficients, and the partially directed coherence (PDC) coefficients derived from Granger Causality (GC) analysis. Effective connectivity measures are treated as input classifier features to assess their significance by means of cross-validation classification accuracy results in a wrapper feature selection approach. Experimental results using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers on an rs-fMRI dataset of schizophrenia patients with and without a history of AH confirm that the main regions identified in the AH generative mechanism hypothesis have significant effective connection values, under both DCM and PDC evaluation.

AB The acceleration of CNNs has gained increasing attention since their success in computer vision. Since the heterogeneous layers cannot be processed by accelerators proposed for convolution layers only, modern end-to-end CNN acceleration solutions either transform diverse computation into matrix/vector arithmetic, which loses data reuse opportunities in convolution, or introduce dedicated functional unit to each kind of layer, which results in underutilization and high update expenses. To enhance the whole-life cost efficiency, we need a solution that is efficient in processing CNN layers and has the generality to apply to all kinds of existing and emerging layers. To this end, we propose GCONV Chain, a method to convert the entire CNN computation into a chain of standard general convolutions (GCONV) that can be efficiently processed by existing CNN accelerators with low-overhead hardware support. This paper comprehensively analyzes the GCONV Chain model and proposes a full-stack implementation to support GCONV Chain. Our results on various CNNs demonstrate that GCONV Chain improves the performance and energy efficiency of existing CNN accelerators by an average of 3.4x and 3.2x respectively. Furthermore, we show that GCONV Chain provides low whole-life costs for CNN acceleration, including both developer efforts and total cost of ownership.

AB We investigate how college participation may differentially influence civic behaviors among individuals who were between 18 and 20 years old in 2012. Using data from the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, we consider two direct measures of civic behavior, voter registration and volunteerism. We generate our estimates with propensity forests, a machine learning algorithm that can mitigate bias when using observational data and supports investigation of heterogeneous treatment effects. Overall, we find that college-goers are more likely to register to vote and volunteer, though, conditional on volunteering at all, likely to volunteer fewer hours. We find limited evidence of heterogeneous returns across various groups, suggesting that civic returns to higher education are broadly shared by those who attend.

AB Position emission tomography (PET) is widely used in clinics and research due to its quantitative merits and high sensitivity, but suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Recently convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used to improve PET image quality. Though successful and efficient in local feature extraction, CNN cannot capture long-range dependencies well due to its limited receptive field. Global multi-head self-attention (MSA) is a popular approach to capture long-range information. However, the calculation of global MSA for 3D images has high computational costs. In this work, we proposed an efficient spatial and channel-wise encoder-decoder transformer, Spach Transformer, that can leverage spatial and channel information based on local and global MSAs. Experiments based on datasets of different PET tracers, i.e., F-18-FDG, F-18-ACBC, F-18-DCFPyL, and Ga-68-DOTATATE, were conducted to evaluate the proposed framework. Quantitative results show that the proposed Spach Transformer framework outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning architectures.

   difference method; thermal factors; buildings; residential
AB This paper reports on the development of a new approach for simulating the thermal behavior of buildings that overcome the limitations of conventional heat-transfer simulation methods such as the finite difference method and the finite element method. The proposed technique uses a coarse-grain approach to model development whereby each element represents a complete building component such as a wall, internal space, or floor. The thermal behavior of each coarse-grain element is captured using empirical modeling techniques such as artificial neural networks (ANNs). The main advantages of the approach compared to conventional simulation methods are (1) simplified model construction for the end-user; (2) simplified model reconfiguration; (3) significantly faster simulation runs (orders of magnitude faster for two- and three-dimensional models); and (4) potentially more accurate results. The paper demonstrates the viability of the approach through a number of experiments with a model of a composite wall. The approach is shown to be able to sustain highly accurate long-term simulation runs, if the coarse-grain modeling elements are implemented as ANNs. In contrast, an implementation of the coarse-grain elements using a linear model is shown to function inaccurately and erratically. The paper concludes with an identification of on-going work and future areas for development of the technique.

AB The maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) has received increasing attention in signal processing and machine learning due to its robustness against outliers (or impulsive noises). Some gradient based adaptive filtering algorithms under MCC have been developed and available for practical use. The fixed-point algorithms under MCC are, however, seldom studied. In particular, too little attention has been paid to the convergence issue of the fixed-point MCC algorithms. In this letter, we will study this problem and give a sufficient condition to guarantee the convergence of a fixed-point MCC algorithm.

AB Objective This study explores the prediction of near-term suicidal behavior using machine learning (ML) analyses of the Suicide Crisis Inventory (SCI), which measures the Suicide Crisis Syndrome, a presuicidal mental state.
   Methods SCI data were collected from high-risk psychiatric inpatients (N = 591) grouped based on their short-term suicidal behavior, that is, those who attempted suicide between intake and 1-month follow-up dates (N = 20) and those who did not (N = 571). Data were analyzed using three predictive algorithms (logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting) and three sampling approaches (split sample, Synthetic minority oversampling technique, and enhanced bootstrap).
   Results The enhanced bootstrap approach considerably outperformed the other sampling approaches, with random forest (98.0% precision; 33.9% recall; 71.0% Area under the precision-recall curve [AUPRC]; and 87.8% Area under the receiver operating characteristic [AUROC]) and gradient boosting (94.0% precision; 48.9% recall; 70.5% AUPRC; and 89.4% AUROC) algorithms performing best in predicting positive cases of near-term suicidal behavior using this dataset.
   Conclusions ML can be useful in analyzing data from psychometric scales, such as the SCI, and for predicting near-term suicidal behavior. However, in cases such as the current analysis where the data are highly imbalanced, the optimal method of measuring performance must be carefully considered and selected.

AB Artificial intelligence (AI), since its marked proliferation in the mid-2010s, has significantly penetrated various sectors, becoming a transformative force that necessitates ongoing refinement of communication strategies and political dynamics by stakeholders. Drawing on the Orientation-Stimulus-Reasoning-Orientation-Response (O-S-R-O-R) model, this study delves into the role of AI news consumption in participatory democracy. Using data from a nationwide survey (N = 1,252), the study assesses a mediation model that proposes a multilayered process through which AI news consumption facilitates civic participation. The findings reveal that AI news consumption across different media platforms is positively linked with civic participation, facilitated by both online and offline AI discussions. This relationship is further mediated by trust in AI news and trust in AI actors. Further theoretical and practical implications are also discussed.

AB Monitoring cow body weight is crucial to support farm management decisions due to its direct relationship with the growth, nutritional status, and health of dairy cows. Cow body weight is a repeated trait, however, the majority of previous body weight prediction research only used data collected at a single point in time. Furthermore, the utility of deep learning-based segmentation for body weight prediction using videos remains unanswered. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to predict cow body weight from repeatedly measured video data, to compare the performance of the thresholding and Mask R-CNN deep learning approaches, to evaluate the predictive ability of body weight regression models, and to promote open science in the animal science community by releasing the source code for video-based body weight prediction. An Intel RealSense D435 camera was installed on Virginia Tech dairy complex to collect top-view videos of 10 lactating Holstein cows twice a day for 28 days after milking sessions and 2 non-lactating, pregnant Jersey cows once a week upon calving. At the same time, the ground truth body weight records were collected using a walk-over weighing system. A total of 40,405 depth images and depth map files were obtained. Three approaches were investigated to segment the cow's body from the background, including single thresholding, adaptive thresholding, and Mask R-CNN. Four image-derived biometric features, such as dorsal length, abdominal width, height, and volume, were estimated from the segmented images and fitted using ordinary least squares, ridge regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, and linear mixed models. Two cross-validation designs, forecasting and leave-three-cows-out, were used to evaluate prediction performance. The Pearson correlation between image-derived biometric features and scale-based body weight ranged from 0.74 to 0.95. On average, the MaskRCNN approach combined with a linear mixed model resulted in the best prediction coefficient of determination and mean absolute percentage error of 0.98 and 2.03%, respectively, in the forecasting cross-validation. The Mask-RCNN approach was also the best in the leave-three-cows-out cross-validation, followed by adaptive and single thresholding. The prediction coefficients of determination and mean absolute percentage error of the Mask-RCNN coupled with the linear mixed model were 0.90 and 4.70%, respectively. Our results suggest that deep learning-based segmentation improves the prediction performance of cow body weight from longitudinal depth video data.

AB The objective of precision medicine is to tailor interventions to an individual patient's unique characteristics. A key technology for this purpose involves medical digital twins, computational models of human biology that can be personalized and dynamically updated to incorporate patient-specific data. Certain aspects of human biology, such as the immune system, are not easily captured with physics-based models, such as differential equations. Instead, they are often multi-scale, stochastic and hybrid. This poses a challenge to existing control and optimization approaches that cannot be readily applied to such models. Recent advances in neural-network control methods hold promise in addressing complex control problems. However, the application of these approaches to biomedical systems is still in its early stages. This work employs dynamics-informed neural-network controllers as an alternative approach to control of medical digital twins. As a first use case, we focus on the control of agent-based models (ABMs), a versatile and increasingly common modelling platform in biomedicine. The effectiveness of the proposed neural-network control methods is illustrated and benchmarked against other methods with two widely used ABMs. To account for the inherent stochastic nature of the ABMs we aim to control, we quantify uncertainty in relevant model and control parameters.This article is part of the theme issue 'Uncertainty quantification for healthcare and biological systems (Part 1)'.

AB Ferroelectric thin-film transistors (Fe-TFTs) have promising potential for flexible electronics, memory, and neuromorphic computing applications. Here, we report on a physics-based efficient device model for Fe-TFTs that effectively describes memory switching and device I-V characteristics. This model combines a stochastic multi-domain description of FE switching dynamics with a virtual source treatment of TFT device characteristics. It demonstrates that the memory window of Fe-TFTs depends on the amplitude and duration of the applied voltage pulses, thus suggesting quantitative means of programming and control. Additionally, we introduce a machine-learning-enabled method to automatically generate optimal voltage pulses for accurately programming multiple intermediate FE states, which is crucial for multi-bit memory and neuromorphic computing applications. To showcase the model's applications, we simulate a 4 x 4 crossbar array circuit based on Fe-TFTs, highlighting its utility in performing multiply-accumulate computing operations. This small array can achieve a high speed of similar to 1.28 tera operations per second (OPS) and a power efficiency of similar to 0.43 W/PetaOPS. The model developed here is valuable for exploring the capabilities of Fe-TFTs in future flexible memory and computing technologies.

ID INFORMATION
AB Supply chain management has gained renewed interest among researchers in recent years. This is primarily due to the availability of timely information across the various stages of the supply chain, and therefore the need to effectively utilize the information for improved performance. Although information plays a major role in effective functioning of supply chains, there is a paucity of studies that deal specifically with the dynamics of supply chains and how data collected in these systems can be used to improve their performance. In this paper I develop a framework, with machine learning, for automated supply chain configuration. Supply chain configuration used to be mostly a one-shot problem. Once a supply chain is configured, researchers and practitioners were more interested in means to improve performance given that initial configuration. However, recent developments in e-commerce applications and faster communication over the Internet in general necessitates dynamic (re)configuration of supply chains over time to take advantage of better configurations. Using examples, I show performance improvements of the proposed adaptive supply chain configuration framework over static configurations. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A Stiefel manifold of the compact type is often encountered in many fields of engineering including, signal and image processing, machine learning, numerical optimization and others. The Stiefel manifold is a Riemannian homogeneous space but not a symmetric space. In previous work, researchers have defined probability distributions on symmetric spaces and performed statistical analysis of data residing in these spaces. In this paper, we present original work involving definition of Gaussian distributions on a homogeneous space and show that the maximum-likelihood estimate of the location parameter of a Gaussian distribution on the homogeneous space yields the Frechet mean (FM) of the samples drawn from this distribution. Further, we present an algorithm to sample from the Gaussian distribution on the Stiefel manifold and recursively compute the FM of these samples. We also prove the weak consistency of this recursive FM estimator. Several synthetic and real data experiments are then presented, demonstrating the superior computational performance of this estimator over the gradient descent based nonrecursive counter part as well as the stochastic gradient descent based method prevalent in literature.

AB The dynamics of cortical cognitive maps developed by self-organization must include the aspects of long and short-term memory. The behavior of such a neural network is characterized by an equation of neural activity as a fast phenomenon and an equation of synaptic modification as a slow part of the neural system. We present a new method of analyzing the dynamics of a biological relevant system with different time scales based on the theory of flow invariance. We are able to show the conditions under which the solutions of such a system are bounded being less restrictive than with the K-monotone theory, singular perturbation theory, or those based on supervised synaptic learning. We prove the existence and the uniqueness of the equilibrium. A strict Lyapunov function for the flow of a competitive neural system with different time scales is given and based on it we are able to prove the global exponential stability of the equilibrium point.

TI AN ANALYSIS OF THE GAMMA-MEMORY IN DYNAMIC NEURAL NETWORKS
SO IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS
LA English
DT Note
AB In this paper we present a vector space framework to study short-term memory filters in dynamic neural networks. We define parameters to quantify the function of feedforward and recursive linear memory filters. We show, using vector spaces, what is the optimization problem solved by the PEs of the first hidden layer of the single input focused network architecture. Due to the special properties of the gamma bases, recursion brings an extra parameter lambda (the time constant of the leaky integrator) that displaces the memory manifold towards the desired signal when the mean square error is minimized. In contrast, for the feedforward memory filter the angle between the desired signal and the memory manifold is fixed for a given memory order. The adaptation of the feedback parameter can be done using gradient descent, but the optimization is nonconvex.

AB Additive manufacturing in construction demands an in-depth understanding of the rheological properties of fresh concrete. However, the abundant data in this field remains underexplored. This conventional fragmented approach has hindered broader progress and innovation. This study aims to develop rheological models for 3D printable concrete through a comprehensive, data-driven paradigm, emphasizing the urgent need for a unified, large-scale dataset. By compiling data spanning a decade, we have created an open-access dataset that contains mix designs and experimental results on the rheological behaviors of additive construction concrete. A machine learning-based model and explicit polynomial expressions for estimating rheological properties were developed. The developed machine learning model can take nineteen different parameters as inputs to predict the rheological behavior of printed concrete, showing superiority over models considering a few parameters. Our model can predict the properties of unexplored mix designs, with tailored expressions for practical engineering in additive construction. This enhances understanding of concrete mix design and rheology, highlighting the importance of data-driven method in unveiling the complexity of concrete.

TI Hybrid first-principles neural networks model for column flotation
SO AICHE JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB A new model for phosphate column flotation is presented which for the first time relates the effects of operating variables such as frother concentration on column performance. This is a hybrid model that combines a first-principles model with artificial neural networks. The first-principles model is obtained from material balances on both phosphate particles and gangue (undesired material containing mostly silica). First-order rates of net attachment are assumed for both. Artificial neural networks relate the attachment rate constants to the operating variables. Experiments were conducted in a 6-in.-dia. (152-mm-dia.) laboratory column to provide data for neural network training and model validation. The model successfully predicts the effects of frother concentration, particle size, air flow rate and bubble diameter on grade and recovery.

AB The theory of artificial neural networks has been successfully applied to a wide variety of pattern recognition problems. In this theory, the first step in computing the next state of a neuron or in performing the next layer neural network computation involves the linear operation of multiplying neural values by their synaptic strengths and adding the results. Thresholding usually follows the linear operation in order to provide for nonlinearity of the network. In this paper we discuss a novel class of artificial neural networks, called morphological neural networks ;s in which the operations of multiplication and addition are replaced by addition and maximum (or minimum), respectively. By taking the maximum (or minimum) of sums instead of the sum of products, morphological network computation is nonlinear before thresholding. As a consequence, the properties of morphological neural networks are drastically different from those of traditional neural network models. The main emphasis of the research presented here is on morphological bidirectional associative memories (MBAMs). In particular, we establish a mathematical theory for MBAMs and provide conditions that guarantee perfect bidirectional recall for corrupted patterns. Some examples that illustrate performance differences between the morphological model and the traditional semilinear model are also given. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An enhanced time-delay neural network (TDNN), using time series sensor response data, improved pattern recognition ability of an electronic nose (e-nose) in discriminating four different spices. TDNN was used for analysis of e-nose time series sensor data from 0 to 4 min, while two popular pattern recognition methods, discriminant function analysis (DFA) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) trained by back-propagation, were used to analyze the "instantaneous" e-nose data obtained from sensor responses only at 4 min. The results showed that DFA and MLP correctly recognized 59.4 and 62.5% of the spices respectively while TDNN correctly recognized all (100%) spices. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Current crop phenotyping mainly relies on manual measurements and visual inspection for data collection and crop assessment, which is labor-intensive, subjective, and inefficient. Hence, modern methods depend primarily on using sensors for phenotypic data collection to replace labor vision, developing algorithms for decisionmaking to replace human domain knowledge, and integrating autonomous phenotyping systems to improve efficiencies in the past decades. Despite the research progress in phenotyping, there is a lack of extensive review on this topic that will be useful to various stakeholders interested in this field. Therefore, this study was conducted to perform a comprehensive review of multiple methodologies and techniques used in high-throughput ground crop phenotyping systems. A Web of Science literature search was conducted with appropriate keywords for the recent past, and the research trends in this field were captured. The current review categorizes the progress of technology in terms of phenotyping platform, sensing, data processing, and system integration. Platforms have evolved from manual-based to autonomous. Manual-based platforms require workers for data collection, while autonomous platforms involve new technologies for navigation and data collection. Different sensing techniques are used for phenotyping data collection. This study mainly discusses the mainstream sensors, including RGB, multi/hyperspectral, thermal, stereo, and light detection and ranging, and concludes that multisource sensors could provide more accurate phenotypic information. Algorithms are applied to collected data to extract useful phenotyping information at different scales (organ, individual plant, and community). Both machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have been used for phenotyping information extraction, and the DL is gradually replacing ML due to its superior performance. A case study of integrated high-throughput proximal phenotyping robot was presented, showing how different sensors and navigation systems come together to achieve on-site and real-time measurements. Advancements in high-throughput proximal ground phenotyping systems through new information, communication, sensing, and autonomous technologies in agriculture are anticipated to be more integrated and efficient phenotyping. It is anticipated that autonomous robots would finally replace workers from laborious phenotyping work.

AB The field performance of a newly developed novel smart variable-rate sprayer was evaluated. The sprayer uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for target detection and spot-applications of agrochemicals within potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) fields attacked by lamb's quarters (Chenopodium album L.) and corn spurry (Spergula arvensis L.) weeds and the early blight potato disease caused by Alternaria solani Sorauer. There was a nonsignificant effect of treatment conditions (i.e., cloudy, partly cloudy, and sunny) on spray volume during weed and diseased plant detection experiments (p-value = 0.93 and 0.75, respectively) showing that the smart sprayer performed well during all treatment conditions. There was a significant effect of spraying application techniques on the use of spray volume (p-value <= 0.05) reflecting a significant saving of spraying liquid during variable-rate application (VA). On average, the sprayer reduced spray volume by 47 and 51% for weeds and diseased plant detection experiments as compared to the values of chemicals applied at constant-rate application (CA), respectively, under all treatment conditions. The analysis of water-sensitive papers (WSP) data resulted in non-significant differences between CA and VA under all field conditions. These results suggest that this sprayer has a great potential to get a suitable spot application of agrochemicals and reduce the use of plant protection products thereby ensuring farm profits and environmental stewardship.

AB Background: Early and accurate diagnosis of melanoma, the deadliest type of skin cancer, has the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality rate. However, early diagnosis of melanoma is not trivial even for experienced dermatologists, as it needs sampling and laboratory tests which can be extremely complex and subjective. The accuracy of clinical diagnosis of melanoma is also an issue especially in distinguishing between melanoma and mole. To solve these problems, this paper presents an approach that makes non-subjective judgements based on quantitative measures for automatic diagnosis of melanoma.
   Methods: Our approach involves image acquisition, image processing, feature extraction, and classification. 187 images (19 malignant melanoma and 168 benign lesions) were collected in a clinic by a spectroscopic device that combines single-scattered, polarized light spectroscopy with multiple-scattered, un-polarized light spectroscopy. After noise reduction and image normalization, features were extracted based on statistical measurements (i.e. mean, standard deviation, mean absolute deviation, L-1 norm, and L-2 norm) of image pixel intensities to characterize the pattern of melanoma. Finally, these features were fed into certain classifiers to train learning models for classification.
   Results: We adopted three classifiers - artificial neural network, naive bayes, and k-nearest neighbour to evaluate our approach separately. The naive bayes classifier achieved the best performance - 89% accuracy, 89% sensitivity and 89% specificity, which was integrated with our approach in a desktop application running on the spectroscopic system for diagnosis of melanoma.
   Conclusions: Our work has two strengths. (1) We have used single scattered polarized light spectroscopy and multiple scattered unpolarized light spectroscopy to decipher the multilayered characteristics of human skin. (2) Our approach does not need image segmentation, as we directly probe tiny spots in the lesion skin and the image scans do not involve background skin. The desktop application for automatic diagnosis of melanoma can help dermatologists get a non-subjective second opinion for their diagnosis decision.

AB Monkeys can learn to directly control the movements of an artificial actuator by using a brain - machine interface ( BMI) driven by the activity of a sample of cortical neurons. Eventually, they can do so without moving their limbs. Neuronal adaptations underlying the transition from control of the limb to control of the actuator are poorly understood. Here, we show that rapid modifications in neuronal representation of velocity of the hand and actuator occur in multiple cortical areas during the operation of a BMI. Initially, monkeys controlled the actuator by moving a hand- held pole. During this period, the BMI was trained to predict the actuator velocity. As the monkeys started using their cortical activity to control the actuator, the activity of individual neurons and neuronal populations became less representative of the animal's hand movements while representing the movements of the actuator. As a result of this adaptation, the animals could eventually stop moving their hands yet continue to control the actuator. These results show that, during BMI control, cortical ensembles represent behaviorally significant motor parameters, even if these are not associated with movements of the animal's own limb.

AB An important task of meta-analysis is to observe, quantify, and explain the heterogeneity across the reported effect sizes of primary studies. A primary issue that challenges this task is the myriad of subtle factors that could have contributed to the observed heterogeneity. We leveraged the recent advances in theoretical machine learning to develop a novel latent mixture-based method for disentangling effect-size heterogeneity in meta-analysis. Mathematical analysis and simulation studies were carried out to demonstrate that, when the observed heterogeneity stems from more than 1 factor, our method can attain a substantially higher statistical power than the traditional methods for moderator analysis without requiring researchers to make judgment calls on which factors to consider or correct for in analyzing the observed heterogeneity. We also conducted a case study with real-world data to show how our method may be used to address long-standing inconsistencies in the literature.
   Translational Abstract An important task of meta-analysis is to explain the heterogeneity among primary studies. However, it is often a challenge for researchers to delineate the myriad of subtle factors that could have contributed to the observed heterogeneity. We leveraged the recent advances in theoretical machine learning, specifically the efficient decomposition of Gaussian mixture distributions, to develop a novel latent mixture-based method for disentangling heterogeneity in meta-analysis. As demonstrated by mathematical analysis and simulation studies for moderator estimation, our method can attain substantially higher statistical power than the traditional methods without requiring researchers to make judgment calls on which factors to consider or correct for in analyzing the observed heterogeneity.

TI Predictors of left atrial appendage thrombus in atrial fibrillation
   patients undergoing cardioversion

AB BackgroundAtrial fibrillation and atrial flutter represent the most prevalent clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias. While the CHA2DS2-VASc score is commonly used to inform anticoagulation therapy decisions for patients with these conditions, its predictive power is limited. Therefore, we sought to improve risk prediction for left atrial appendage thrombus (LAAT), a known risk factor for stroke in these patients. MethodsWe developed and validated an explainable machine learning model using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting algorithm with 5 x 5 nested cross-validation. The primary outcome was to predict the probability of LAAT in patients with atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter who underwent transesophageal echocardiogram prior to cardioversion. Our algorithm used 37 demographic, comorbid, and transthoracic echocardiographic variables. ResultsA total of 795 patients were included in our analysis. LAAT was present in 11.3% of the patients. The average age of patients was 63.3 years and 34.7% were women. Patients with LAAT had significantly lower left ventricular ejection fraction (29.9% vs 43.5%; p < 0.001), lower E' lateral velocity (5.7 cm vs. 7.9 cm; p < 0.001) and higher E/A ratio (2.6 vs 1.8; p = 0.002). Our machine learning model achieved a high AUC of 0.79, with a high specificity of 0.82, and modest sensitivity of 0.57. Left ventricular ejection fraction was the most important variable in predicting LAAT. Patients were split into 10 buckets based on the percentile of their predicted probability of having thrombus. The lower the percentile (e.g., 10%), the lower the probability of having thrombus. Using a cutoff point of 0.16 which includes 10.0% of the patients, we can rule out thrombus with 100% confidence. ConclusionUsing machine learning, we refined the predictive power of predicting LAAT and explained the model. These results show promise in providing better guidance for anticoagulation therapy and cardioversion in AF and AFL patients.

AB Sufficient physical activity (PA) reduces the risk of a myriad of diseases and preserves physical capabilities in later life. While there have been significant achievements in mapping accelerations to real-life movements using machine learning (ML), errors continue to be common, particularly for wrist-worn devices. It remains unknown whether ML models are robust for estimating age-related loss of physical function. In this study, we evaluated the performance of ML models (XGBoost and LASSO) to estimate the hallmark measures of PA in low physical performance (LPP) and high physical performance (HPP) groups. Our models were built to recognize PA types and intensities, identify each individual activity, and estimate energy expenditure (EE) using wrist-worn accelerometer data (33 activities per participant) from a large sample of participants (n = 247, 57% females, aged 60+ years). Results indicated that the ML models were accurate in recognizing PA by type and intensity while also estimating EE accurately. However, the models built to recognize individual activities were less robust. Across all tasks, XGBoost outperformed LASSO. XGBoost obtained F1-Scores for sedentary (0.932 +/- 0.005), locomotion (0.946 +/- 0.003), lifestyle (0.927 +/- 0.006), and strength flexibility exercise (0.915 +/- 0.017) activity type recognition tasks. The F1-Scores for recognizing low, light, and moderate activity intensity were (0.932 +/- 0.005), (0.840 +/- 0.004), and (0.869 +/- 0.005), respectively. The root mean square error for EE estimation was 0.836 +/- 0.059 METs. There was no evidence showing that splitting the participants into the LPP and HPP groups improved the models' performance on estimating the hallmark measures of physical activities. In conclusion, using features derived from wrist-worn accelerometer data, machine learning models can accurately recognize PA types and intensities and estimate EE for older adults with high and low physical function.

TI BertSNR: an interpretable deep learning framework for single-nucleotide
   resolution identification of transcription factor binding sites based on

SO BIOINFORMATICS
LA English
DT Article
ID CHIP-SEQ; DATABASE; OCT4
AB Motivation Transcription factors are pivotal in the regulation of gene expression, and accurate identification of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) at high resolution is crucial for understanding the mechanisms underlying gene regulation. The task of identifying TFBSs from DNA sequences is a significant challenge in the field of computational biology today. To address this challenge, a variety of computational approaches have been developed. However, these methods face limitations in their ability to achieve high-resolution identification and often lack interpretability.Results We propose BertSNR, an interpretable deep learning framework for identifying TFBSs at single-nucleotide resolution. BertSNR integrates sequence-level and token-level information by multi-task learning based on pre-trained DNA language models. Benchmarking comparisons show that our BertSNR outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods in TFBS predictions. Importantly, we enhanced the interpretability of the model through attentional weight visualization and motif analysis, and discovered the subtle relationship between attention weight and motif. Moreover, BertSNR effectively identifies TFBSs in promoter regions, facilitating the study of intricate gene regulation.Availability and implementation The BertSNR source code can be found at https://github.com/lhy0322/BertSNR.

AB Support vector machines (SVMs) are powerful statistical learning tools, but their application to large datasets can cause time-consuming training complexity. To address this issue, various instance selection (IS) approaches have been proposed, which choose a small fraction of critical instances and screen out others before training. However, existing methods have not been able to balance accuracy and efficiency well. Some methods miss critical instances, while others use complicated selection schemes that require even more execution time than training with all original instances, thus violating the initial intention of IS. In this work, we present a newly developed IS method called Valid Border Recognition (VBR). VBR selects the closest heterogeneous neighbors as valid border instances and incorporates this process into the creation of a reduced Gaussian kernel matrix, thus minimizing the execution time. To improve reliability, we propose a strengthened version of VBR (SVBR). Based on VBR, SVBR gradually adds farther heterogeneous neighbors as complements until the Lagrange multipliers of already selected instances become stable. In numerical experiments, the effectiveness of our proposed methods is verified on benchmark and synthetic datasets in terms of accuracy, execution time and inference time.

ID STRUCTURAL-CHARACTERIZATION; METABOLOMICS; VALUES; LIPIDS
AB Ion mobility (IM) spectrometry provides semi orthogonal data to mass spectrometry (MS), showing promise for identifying unknown metabolites in complex non-targeted metabolomics data sets. While current literature has showcased IM-MS for identifying unknowns under near ideal circumstances, less work has been conducted to evaluate the performance of this approach in metabolomics studies involving highly complex samples with difficult matrices. Here, we present a workflow incorporating de novo molecular formula annotation and MS/MS structure elucidation using SIRIUS 4 with experimental IM collision cross-section (CCS) measurements and machine learning CCS predictions to identify differential unknown metabolites in mutant strains of Caenorhabditis elegans. For many of those ion features, this workflow enabled the successful filtering of candidate structures generated by in silico MS/MS predictions, though in some cases, annotations were challenged by significant hurdles in instrumentation performance and data analysis. While for 37% of differential features we were able to successfully collect both MS/MS and CCS data, fewer than half of these features benefited from a reduction in the number of possible candidate structures using CCS filtering due to poor matching of the machine learning training sets, limited accuracy of experimental and predicted CCS values, and lack of candidate structures resulting from the MS/MS data. When using a CCS error cutoff of +/- 3%, on average, 28% of candidate structures could be successfully filtered. Herein, we identify and describe the bottlenecks and limitations associated with the identification of unknowns in non-targeted metabolomics using IM-MS to focus and provide insights into areas requiring further improvement.

AB Reflective dialogue as a job-embedded teacher professional learning activity has still been an unexplored area. Little is known about what factors affect its emergence. This study addresses this gap by examining the effect of the frequency of occurrence of particular meeting agendas on the emergence of reflective dialogue in teacher communities as well as what conditions are conducive to promote reflective dialogue. Using a mixed methods research design, first, we created a single-level multiple-indicators multiple-causes model. Through a focus group interview we delved deep into reflective dialogue. In the quantitative part, we found that the conversations on the goals of the school, curriculum, and student learning contributed to the evolution of reflective dialogue among teachers as these topics are more important. As teachers focus more on discussing these three topics, they begin reflecting on their practice through a collaborative dialogue. The follow-up qualitative study revealed that there are more topics that might promote reflective dialogue. Personal and institutional conditions have been revealed as being necessary for creating culture of reflective dialogue. For school leaders, practical solutions to promote reflective dialogue were provided. For researchers, future research directions were suggested to obtain a fuller picture of reflective dialogue across schools.

AB Although mannequin patient simulator-based training and credentialing has received extensive favorable attention during the last decade, some critics have argued that the expense and the logistics of participating in such exercises may limit the recommendation of widespread mandatory use of this technology. The ubiquitous availability of personal computers and the World Wide Web makes computer and web-enabled simulation an alternative technology that may address some of these criticisms. In this article, the history, technology, application, and future use of computer and web-enabled simulation for anesthesiology training and credentialing is discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive, chronic, and neurodegenerative disorder that is primarily diagnosed by clinical examinations and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this study, we proposed a machine learning based radiomics method to predict PD. Fifty healthy controls (HC) along with 70 PD patients underwent resting-state magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). For all subjects, we extracted five types of 6664 features, including mean amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (mALFF), mean regional homogeneity (mReHo), resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC), voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) and gray matter (GM) volume. After conducting dimension reduction utilizing Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), fifty-three radiomic features including 46 RSFCs, 1 mALFF, 3 mReHos, 1 VMHC, 2 GM volumes and 1 clinical factor were retained. The selected features also indicated the most discriminative regions for PD. We further conducted model fitting procedure for classifying subjects in the training set employing random forest and support volume machine (SVM) to evaluate the performance of the two methods. After cross-validation, both methods achieved 100% accuracy and area under curve (AUC) for distinguishing between PD and HC in the training set. In the testing set, SVM performed better than random forest with the accuracy, true positive rate (TPR) and AUC being 85%, 1 and 0.97, respectively. These findings demonstrate the radiomics technique has the potential to support radiological diagnosis and to achieve high classification accuracy for clinical diagnostic systems for patients with PD.

AB This study examines the effect of telephone survey dialing patterns on lab productivity and survey responses. Using an original data set of paradata from 2010 to 2017 and a machine learning technique for variable selection, we find that early and late afternoon shifts are as productive as late evening shifts for both landline and cellphone Random Digit Dialing (RDD) samples. Also, early weekdays are more productive than the weekend for the cellphone RDD samples. Most importantly, time of the interview affects survey responses; therefore, survey practitioners and scholars should be cognizant of this effect when scheduling calls.

AB PurposeArtificial intelligence (AI) technology will inevitably permeate healthcare. Bing Chat is an AI chatbot with different conservation styles. We evaluated each of these response mode answers regarding management of nephrolithiasis.MethodsA total of 20 questions were created based on the AUA Surgical Management of Stones guidelines. Bing Chat's responses were evaluated across Precise, Balanced, and Creative conversation style chat modes by three physicians using the Brief DISCERN tool. Consensus scoring was employed to assess appropriateness, guideline adherence, empathy, recommendation for physician consultation, and inability to answer the inquiry. Responses were also assessed for their directness and the presence of superfluous information. Chat modes were compared using descriptive statistics as well as ANOVA, Chi-Squared tests, and Fisher exact tests.ResultsThe median Brief DISCERN Score in Precise, Balanced, and Creative modes were: 22, 21, and 21, respectively. There was no significant difference in Brief DISCERN scores between the three chat modes (p = 0.68). Guideline adherence by chatbot conversation style was similar (p = 0.37), as was response appropriateness (p = 0.62), directly answering the question asked (p = 0.26) and providing a recommendation to consult with a healthcare provider (p = 0.07). Creative and balanced modes outperformed precise mode when evaluating response empathy. Creative mode was more likely to include superfluous information and less likely to answer the question.ConclusionIn its current iteration, Bing Chat provides low quality urologic healthcare information for nephrolithiasis queries, regardless of the conversation style utilized.

TI Efficient gravitational-wave glitch identification from environmental

SO PHYSICAL REVIEW D
LA English
DT Article
ID SELECTION
AB The LIGO observatories detect gravitational waves through monitoring changes in the detectors' length down to below 10(-19) m/root Hz variations-a small fraction of the size of the atoms that make up the detector. To achieve this sensitivity, the detector and its environment need to be closely monitored. Beyond the gravitational-wave data stream, LIGO continuously records hundreds of thousands of channels of environmental and instrumental data in order to monitor for possibly minuscule variations that contribute to the detector noise. A particularly challenging issue is the appearance in the gravitational wave signal of brief, loud noise artifacts called "glitches," which are environmental or instrumental in origin but can mimic true gravitational waves and therefore hinder sensitivity. Currently, they are primarily identified by analysis of the gravitational-wave data stream, and auxiliary data channels often provide corroborating evidence. Here we present a machine learning approach that can identify glitches by considering all environmental and detector data channels, a task that has not previously been pursued due to its scale and the number of degrees of freedom within gravitational-wave detectors. The presented method is capable of reducing the gravitational-wave detector network's false alarm rate and improving the LIGO instruments, consequently enhancing detection confidence.

AB Today's research on human-robot teaming requires the ability to test artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for perception and decision-making in complex real-world environments. Field experiments, also referred to as experiments "in the wild," do not provide the level of detailed ground truth necessary for thorough performance comparisons and validation. Experiments on pre-recorded real-world data sets are also significantly limited in their usefulness because they do not allow researchers to test the effectiveness of active robot perception and control or decision strategies in the loop. Additionally, research on large human-robot teams requires tests and experiments that are too costly even for the industry and may result in considerable time losses when experiments go awry. The novel Real-Time Human Autonomous Systems Collaborations (RealTHASC) facility at Cornell University interfaces real and virtual robots and humans with photorealistic simulated environments by implementing new concepts for the seamless integration of wearable sensors, motion capture, physics-based simulations, robot hardware and virtual reality (VR). The result is an extended reality (XR) testbed by which real robots and humans in the laboratory are able to experience virtual worlds, inclusive of virtual agents, through real-time visual feedback and interaction. VR body tracking by DeepMotion is employed in conjunction with the OptiTrack motion capture system to transfer every human subject and robot in the real physical laboratory space into a synthetic virtual environment, thereby constructing corresponding human/robot avatars that not only mimic the behaviors of the real agents but also experience the virtual world through virtual sensors and transmit the sensor data back to the real human/robot agent, all in real time. New cross-domain synthetic environments are created in RealTHASC using Unreal Engine (TM), bridging the simulation-to-reality gap and allowing for the inclusion of underwater/ground/aerial autonomous vehicles, each equipped with a multi-modal sensor suite. The experimental capabilities offered by RealTHASC are demonstrated through three case studies showcasing mixed real/virtual human/robot interactions in diverse domains, leveraging and complementing the benefits of experimentation in simulation and in the real world.

AB Background: Incidence of dementia increases exponentially with age; little is known about its risk factors in the ninth and 10th decades of life. We identified predictors of dementia with onset after age 85 years in a longitudinal population-based cohort. Methods: On the basis of annual assessments, incident cases of dementia were defined as those newly receiving Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) >= 1. We used a machine learning method, Markov modeling with hybrid density-based and partition-based clustering, to identify variables associated with subsequent incident dementia. Results: Of 1439 participants, 641 reached age 85 years during 10 years of follow-up and 45 of these became incident dementia cases. Using hybrid density-based and partition-based, among those aged 85+ years, probability of incident dementia was associated with worse self-rated health, more prescription drugs, subjective memory complaints, heart disease, cardiac arrhythmia, thyroid disease, arthritis, reported hypertension, higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and hearing impairment. In the subgroup aged 85 to 89 years, risk of dementia was also associated with depression symptoms, not currently smoking, and lacking confidantes. Conclusions: An atheoretical machine learning method revealed several factors associated with increased probability of dementia after age 85 years in a population-based cohort. If independently validated in other cohorts, these findings could help identify the oldest-old at the highest risk of dementia.

   FRAMEWORK; PATTERNS; BEHAVIOR
AB As universities around the world have begun to use learning management systems (LMSs), more learning data have become available to gain deeper insights into students' learning processes and make data-driven decisions to improve student learning. With the availability of rich data extracted from the LMS, researchers have turned much of their attention to learning analytics (LA) applications using educational data mining techniques. Numerous LA models have been proposed to predict student achievement in university courses. To design predictive LA models, researchers often follow a data-driven approach that prioritizes prediction accuracy while sacrificing theoretical links to learning theory and its pedagogical implications. In this study, we argue that instead of complex variables (e.g., event logs, clickstream data, timestamps of learning activities), data extracted from online formative assessments should be the starting point for building predictive LA models. Using the LMS data from multiple offerings of an asynchronous undergraduate course, we analysed the utility of online formative assessments in predicting students' final course performance. Our findings showed that the features extracted from online formative assessments (e.g., completion, timestamps and scores) served as strong and significant predictors of students' final course performance. Scores from online formative assessments were consistently the strongest predictor of student performance across the three sections of the course. The number of clicks in the LMS and the time difference between first access and due dates of formative assessments were also significant predictors. Overall, our findings emphasize the need for online formative assessments to build predictive LA models informed by theory and learning design. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Higher education institutions often use learning analytics for the early identification of low-performing students or students at risk of dropping out. Most predictive models in learning analytics rely on immutable student characteristics (e.g., gender, race and socioeconomic status) and complex variables extracted from log data within a learning management system. Prioritizing prediction accuracy without theory orientation often yields "black-box" models that fail to inform educators on what remedies need to be taken to improve student learning. What this paper adds Predictive models in learning analytics should consider learning theory, pedagogy and learning design to identify key predictors of student learning. Online formative assessments can be a starting point for building predictive models that are not only accurate but also provide educators with actionable insights on how student learning can be improved. Time-related and score-related features extracted from online formative assessments are particularly useful for predicting students' course performance. Implications for practice and/or policy This study provides strong evidence for using online formative assessments as the foundation for predictive models in learning analytics. Student data from online formative assessments can help educators provide students with feedback while informing future formative assessment cycles. Higher education institutions should avoid the hype around complex data from learning management systems and instead rely on effective learning tools such as online formative assessments to revolutionize the use of learning analytics.

AB To enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of optoelectronic characterization, Bayesian inference has been applied to the statistical analysis of time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) data with large-scale graphics-processing unit (GPU)-based simulations of electron dynamics. A simulated TRPL dataset, derived from a CH3NH3PbI3-xClx perovskite absorber, was used as a case study. From a power scan, Bayesian inference extracts values of the (ambipolar) carrier mobility, free-carrier density, radiative recombination rate, and the overall life-time of the nonradiative recombination processes. Analysis of the experimental TRPL data yields similar parameter values. The independent contributions of bulk and surface recombination can be distinguished via the introduction of an additional sample thickness. Further experiments separate the front and back surface recombination velocities and can distinguish the electron and hole mobilities. Ultimately, Bayesian inference enables a significant increase in the information yield from TRPL measurements.

AB The reliable prediction of properties for the adsorbates, including their enthalpy, has been a long-standing challenge as a first key step in studying surface reactions. It is especially difficult when large adsorbates are involved as the interactions between the adsorbates and surface atoms are complex. Here, we developed machine learning (ML) models for the prediction of the formation enthalpy of various C-2 to C6 hydrocarbon adsorbates on the Pt(111) surface based on 384 density functional theory calculations. Focusing on larger and more intricate adsorbates, two-thirds of the total species were C6 species. Four molecular descriptors that represent the valency and bonding of individual carbons within the adsorbates were generated without intensive computation. They were subsequently used as the features of the ML models with three linear and four nonlinear algorithms. The models were developed with 30 different samplings of train/test sets, and their results were statistically analyzed to ensure the performance of the models. Nonlinear models, especially kernel ridge regression and extreme gradient boosting, outperformed linear models with lower absolute errors. The top two accurate models, based on these algorithms, also displayed remarkable robustness in predicting various species. Employing ensemble average voting with these two models, we achieved the lowest mean absolute error of 0.94 kcal/molC. Finally, ML was used to estimate the formation enthalpy of 3115 hydrocarbon adsorbates on Pt(111), highlighting the promise of these methods to study more complicated reaction networks.

   Survival analysis; Post-transplant survival prediction
ID MODEL; MELD; ALLOCATION; SCORE
AB Background: The long-term survival of liver transplant (LT) recipients is essential for optimizing organ allocation and estimating mortality outcomes. While models like the Model-for-End-Stage-Liver-Disease (MELD) predict 90- day mortality on the waiting list, they do not predict post-LT survival accurately. There is a need for predictive models that can forecast post-LT survival beyond the immediate period after transplantation. Method: This study introduces new temporal variation features for predicting post-LT survival during the waiting list period. Cox Proportional-Hazards regression (CoxPH), Random Survival Forest (RSF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) models are utilized, along with patient demographics and waiting list duration. Data from 716 LT patients from the University of Minnesota CTSI (2011-2021) are used to develop, evaluate, and compare post-LT survival prediction models. Results: The temporal variation features, particularly when combined with the RSF model, proved most effective in predicting post-LT survival, with a C-index of 0.71 and an IBS of 0.151. This outperformed the predictive capability of the most recent MELD score, which had a C-index of <0.51 in the same cohort. Conclusions: Incorporating temporal variation features with the RSF model enhances long-term post-LT survival predictions. These insights can assist clinicians and patients in making more informed decisions about organ allocation and understanding the utility of LT, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes.

AB Background/Aims Motility, stool characteristics, and microbiota composition are expected to modulate probiotics' passage through the gut but their effects on persistence after intake cessation remain uncharacterized. This pilot, open-label study aims at characterizing probiotic fecal detection parameters (onset, persistence, and duration) and their relationship with whole gut transit time (WGTT). Correlations with fecal microbiota composition are also explored. Methods Thirty healthy adults (30.4 +/- 13.3 years) received a probiotic (30 x 109 CFU/capsule/day, 2 weeks; containing Lactobacillus helveticus R0052, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei HA-108, Bifidobacterium breve HA-129, Bifidobacterium longum R0175, and Streptococcus thermophilus HA-110). Probiotic intake was flanked by 4-week washout periods, with 18 stool collections throughout the study. WGTT was measured using 80% recovery of radio-opaque markers. Results Tested strains were detected in feces-1-2 days after first intake and persistence after intake cessation was not significantly different for R0052, HA-108, and HA-129 (-3-6 days). We identified 3 WGTT subgroups within this population (named Fast, Intermediate, and Slow), which could be classified by machine learning with high accuracy based on differentially abundant taxa. On average, R0175 persisted significantly longer in the intermediate WGTT subgroup (-8.5 days), which was mainly due to 6 of the 13 Intermediate participants for whom R0175 persisted >= 15 days. Machine learning classified these 13 participants according to their WGTT cluster (>= 15 days or < 5 days) with high accuracy, highlighting differentially abundant taxa potentially associated with R0175 persistence. Conclusion These results support the notion that host-specific parameters such as WGTT and microbiota composition should be considered when designing studies involving probiotics, especially for the optimization of washout duration in crossover studies but also for the definition of enrollment criteria or supplementation regimen in specific populations.

The technique simply groups together similar patches from a noisy image (with similarity defined by a statistically motivated criterion) into a 3D stack, computes the HOSVD coefficients of this stack, manipulates these coefficients by hard thresholding, and inverts the HOSVD transform to produce the final filtered image. Our technique chooses all required parameters in a principled way, relating them to the noise model. We also discuss our motivation for adopting the HOSVD as an appropriate transform for image denoising. We experimentally demonstrate the excellent performance of the technique on grayscale as well as color images. On color images, our method produces state-of-the-art results, outperforming other color image denoising algorithms at moderately high noise levels. A criterion for optimal patch-size selection and noise variance estimation from the residual images (after denoising) is also presented.

ID OPTICAL CAVITIES
AB Active mode mismatch sensing and control can facilitate optimal coupling in optical cavity experiments such as interferometric gravitational wave detectors. In this paper, we demonstrate a radio-frequency (RF) beam wavefront curvature modulation-based mode mismatch sensing scheme inspired by the previously proposed RF beam jitter alignment sensing scheme. The proposed mode mismatch sensing scheme uses an electro-optic lens (EOL) device that is designed to provide the required beam wavefront curvature actuation, as well as a mode converting telescope that rephases the RF second-order modes and generates a non-vanishing mode mismatch sensing signal. We carefully investigate the total second-order mode generation from the wavefront actuation both analytically and numerically, taking the effects of Gaussian beam size evolution and the second-order mode phase mismatch cancellation into consideration. We demonstrate the second-order mode generation as a function of the incident beam waist size and the electro-optic crystal size which, along with a "trade-off" consideration of the beam size at the edges of the crystal and the clipping loss, provides us with guidance for designing the beam profile that interacts with the crystal to improve the EOL modulation efficiency.

TI LncLocFormer: a Transformer-based deep learning model for multi-label
   lncRNA subcellular localization prediction by using

SO BIOINFORMATICS

AB Motivation There is mounting evidence that the subcellular localization of lncRNAs can provide valuable insights into their biological functions. In the real world of transcriptomes, lncRNAs are usually localized in multiple subcellular localizations. Furthermore, lncRNAs have specific localization patterns for different subcellular localizations. Although several computational methods have been developed to predict the subcellular localization of lncRNAs, few of them are designed for lncRNAs that have multiple subcellular localizations, and none of them take motif specificity into consideration.Results In this study, we proposed a novel deep learning model, called LncLocFormer, which uses only lncRNA sequences to predict multi-label lncRNA subcellular localization. LncLocFormer utilizes eight Transformer blocks to model long-range dependencies within the lncRNA sequence and shares information across the lncRNA sequence. To exploit the relationship between different subcellular localizations and find distinct localization patterns for different subcellular localizations, LncLocFormer employs a localization-specific attention mechanism. The results demonstrate that LncLocFormer outperforms existing state-of-the-art predictors on the hold-out test set. Furthermore, we conducted a motif analysis and found LncLocFormer can capture known motifs. Ablation studies confirmed the contribution of the localization-specific attention mechanism in improving the prediction performance.Availability and implementation The LncLocFormer web server is available at http://csuligroup.com:9000/LncLocFormer.

ID DISEASE; SPECTROSCOPY; ROC
AB Early accurate detection of crop disease is extremely important for timely disease management. Huanglongbing (HLB), one of the most destructive citrus diseases, has brought about severe economic losses for the global citrus industry. The direct strategies for HLB identification, such as quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and chemical staining, are robust for the symptomatic plants but powerless for the asymptomatic ones at the early stage of affection. Thus, it is very necessary to develop a practical method used for the early detection of HLB. In this study, a novel method combining ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (UHPLC/MS)-based nontargeted metabolomics and machine learning (ML) was developed for conducting the early detection of HLB for the first time. Six ML algorithms were selected to build the classifiers. Regularized logistic regression (LR-L2) and gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) outperformed with the highest average accuracy of 95.83% to not only classify healthy and infected plants but identify significant features. The proposed method proved to be practical for early detection of HLB, which tackled the shortcomings of low sensitivity in the conventional methods and avoid the problems such as lighting condition interference in spectrum/image recognition-based ML methods. Additionally, the discovered biomarkers were verified by the metabolic pathway analysis and content change analysis, which was remarkably consistent with the previous reports.

AB ObjectivesThe objective of this study is the implementation of an automatic procedure to weekly detect new SARS-CoV-2 variants and non-neutral variants (variants of concern (VOC) and variants of interest (VOI)).MethodsWe downloaded spike protein primary sequences from the public resource GISAID and we represented each sequence as k-mer counts. For each week since 1 July 2020, we evaluate if each sequence represents an anomaly based on a One Class support vector machine (SVM) classification algorithm trained on neutral protein sequences collected from February to June 2020.ResultsWe assess the ability of the One Class classifier to detect known VOC and VOI, such as Alpha, Delta or Omicron, ahead of their official classification by health authorities. In median, the classifier predicts a non-neutral variant as outlier 10 weeks before the official date of designation as VOC/VOI.DiscussionThe identification of non-neutral variants during a pandemic usually relies on indicators available during time, such as changing population size of a variant. Automatic variant surveillance systems based on protein sequences can enhance the fast identification of variants of potential concern.ConclusionMachine learning, and in particular One Class SVM classification, can support the detection of potentially VOC/VOI variants during an evolving pandemics.

AB We present image-based evolution of galaxy mergers from the Illustris cosmological simulation at 12 time-steps over 0.5 < z < 5. To do so, we created approximately one million synthetic deep Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope images and measured common morphological indicators. Using the merger tree, we assess methods to observationally select mergers with stellar mass ratios as low as 10: 1 completing within +/- 250 Myr of the mock observation. We confirm that common one-or two-dimensional statistics select mergers so defined with low purity and completeness, leading to high statistical errors. As an alternative, we train redshift-dependent random forests (RFs) based on 5-10 inputs. Cross-validation shows the RFs yield superior, yet still imperfect, measurements of the late-stage merger fraction, and they select more mergers in bulge-dominated galaxies. When applied to CANDELS morphology catalogues, the RFs estimate a merger rate increasing to at least z = 3, albeit two times higher than expected by theory. This suggests possible mismatches in the feedback-determined morphologies, but affirms the basic understanding of galaxy merger evolution. The RFs achieve completeness of roughly 70 per cent at 0.5 < z < 3, and purity increasing from 10 per cent at z = 0.5-60 per cent at z = 3. At earlier times, the training sets are insufficient, motivating larger simulations and smaller time sampling. By blending large surveys and large simulations, such machine learning techniques offer a promising opportunity to teach us the strengths and weaknesses of inferences about galaxy evolution.

AB Delivery of pharmacological agents in vitro can often be a difficult, time consuming and costly process. In this paper, we describe an economical method for in vitro delivery using a hydrogel of poly hydroxyethyl methacrylate (PHEMA) that can absorb up to 50% of its weight of any water-solubilized pharmacological agent. This agent will then passively diffuse into surrounding media upon application in vitro. An in vitro test of PHEMA as a drug delivery device was conducted using dissociated rat-cortical neurons cultured on micro-electrode arrays. These micro-electrode arrays permit the real-time measurement of neural activity at 60 different sites across a network of neurons. Neural activity was compared during the application of PHEMA saturated with cell culture media and PHEMA saturated with bicuculline, a widely used pharmacological agent with stereotypical effects on neural activity patterns. Application of PHEMA saturated with bicuculline produced a gradual increase in concentration in vitro. When the minimum effective concentration of bicuculline was reached, which was found to be 0.59 mu M using the diffusion properties of PHEMA, it produced the rapid almost periodic synchronized bursting characteristically associated with this agent. In contrast, the application of PHEMA saturated in culture media alone had no effect on neural activity reinforcing its inherent inert properties. Since PHEMA is nontoxic, can be molded into a variety of shapes, quickly manufactured in any laboratory and is inexpensive to produce, the material represents a promising alternative to drug delivery systems on the market today.

TI Vagal sensory neurons mediate the BezoldJarisch reflex and induce
   syncope

AB Visceral sensory pathways mediate homeostatic reflexes, the dysfunction of which leads to many neurological disorders1. The Bezold-Jarisch reflex (BJR), first described2,3 in 1867, is a cardioinhibitory reflex that is speculated to be mediated by vagal sensory neurons (VSNs) that also triggers syncope. However, the molecular identity, anatomical organization, physiological characteristics and behavioural influence of cardiac VSNs remain mostly unknown. Here we leveraged single-cell RNA-sequencing data and HYBRiD tissue clearing4 to show that VSNs that express neuropeptide Y receptor Y2 (NPY2R) predominately connect the heart ventricular wall to the area postrema. Optogenetic activation of NPY2R VSNs elicits the classic triad of BJR responseshypotension, bradycardia and suppressed respiration-and causes an animal to faint. Photostimulation during high-resolution echocardiography and laser Doppler flowmetry with behavioural observation revealed a range of phenotypes reflected in clinical syncope, including reduced cardiac output, cerebral hypoperfusion, pupil dilation and eye-roll. Large-scale Neuropixels brain recordings and machine-learning-based modelling showed that this manipulation causes the suppression of activity across a large distributed neuronal population that is not explained by changes in spontaneous behavioural movements. Additionally, bidirectional manipulation of the periventricular zone had a push-pull effect, with inhibition leading to longer syncope periods and activation inducing arousal. Finally, ablating NPY2R VSNs specifically abolished the BJR. Combined, these results demonstrate a genetically defined cardiac reflex that recapitulates characteristics of human syncope at physiological, behavioural and neural network levels.

ID TRACKING
AB Coordinating dynamic interceptive actions in sports like badminton requires skilled performance in getting the racket into the right place at the right time. For this reason, the strategic movement and placement of one's feet, or footwork, is an important part of competitive performance. Developing an automated, efficient, and economical method to record individual movement characteristics of players is critical and can benefit athletes and motor control specialists. Here, we propose new methods for recording data on the footwork of individual badminton players, in which deep learning is used to obtain image coordinates (2D) of their shoes and binocular positioning to reconstruct the 3D coordinates of the shoes. Results show that the final positioning accuracy is 74.7%. Using the proposed methods, we revealed inter-individual adaptations in the footwork of several participants during competitive performance. The data provided insights on how individual participants coordinated footwork to intercept the projectile, by varying the distance traveled on court and jump height. Compared with visual ob-servations by biomechanists and motor control specialists, the proposed methods can obtain quantitative data, provide analysis and evaluation of each participant's performance, revealing personal characteristics that could be targeted to shape the individualized training programs of players to refine their badminton footwork.

AB A perceptron-type neural net was applied to the prediction of oxidation energies for dihydropyridines and related heterocycles. A set of 71 energies corresponding to heats of formation differences for reduced and oxidized derivatives were used to train the net using a back propagation algorithm. A system using four hidden units produced good duplication of the input values (SD = 0.298) and was useful in predicting unknown values (SD = 1.80). Finally, the output matrix was helpful in determining substituent effects.

AB The parameterization of a functional form for an interatomic potential is treated as a problem in multi-objective optimization. An autonomous, machine-learning approach based on the identification of the Pareto hyper-surface of errors in predicted properties allows the development of an ensemble of parameterizations with high materials fidelity and robustness. The efficacy of this approach is illustrated for the simple example of a Buckingham potential for MgO. This approach also provides a strong foundation for uncertainty quantification of potential parameterizations.

ID FEATURE-SELECTION
AB Engineering design plays an important role in education. However, due to its open nature and complexity, providing timely support to students has been challenging using the traditional assessment methods. This study takes an initial step to employ learning analytics to build performance prediction models to help struggling students. It allows instructors to offer in-time intervention and support for these at-risk students. Specifically, we develop a task model to characterize the engineering design process so that the data features can be associated with the abstract engineering design phases. A two-stage feature selection method is proposed to address the data sparsity and high dimensionality problems. Then, instead of relying on probability-based algorithms such as Bayesian Networks to represent the task model, this study used the Radial Basis Function based Support Vector Machines for prediction to identify the struggling students. Next, we employ an extra-tree classification method to rank the importance of these features. Teachers can integrate the feature importance ranking with the abstract task model to diagnose students' problems for scaffolding design. The results show that the proposed approach can outperform the baseline models as well as providing actionable insights for teachers to provide personalized and timely feedback to students. Implications of this study for research and practice are then discussed.

AB Computed Tomography Perfusion (CTP) imaging is a cost-effective and fast approach to provide diagnostic images for acute stroke treatment. Its cine scanning mode allows the visualization of anatomic brain structures and blood flow; however, it requires contrast agent injection and continuous CT scanning over an extended time. In fact, the accumulative radiation dose to patients will increase health risks such as skin irritation, hair loss, cataract formation, and even cancer. Solutions for reducing radiation exposure include reducing the tube current and/or shortening the X-ray radiation exposure time. However, images scanned at lower tube currents are usually accompanied by higher levels of noise and artifacts. On the other hand, shorter X-ray radiation exposure time with longer scanning intervals will lead to image information that is insufficient to capture the blood flow dynamics between frames. Thus, it is critical for us to seek a solution that can preserve the image quality when the tube current and the temporal frequency are both low. We propose STIR-Net in this paper, an end-to-end spatial-temporal convolutional neural network structure, which exploits multi-directional automatic feature extraction and image reconstruction schema to recover high-quality CT slices effectively. With the inputs of low-dose and low-resolution patches at different cross-sections of the spatio-temporal data, STIR-Net blends the features from both spatial and temporal domains to reconstruct high-quality CT volumes. In this study, we finalize extensive experiments to appraise the image restoration performance at different levels of tube current and spatial and temporal resolution scales.The results demonstrate the capability of our STIR-Net to restore high-quality scans at as low as 11% of absorbed radiation dose of the current imaging protocol, yielding an average of 10% improvement for perfusion maps compared to the patch-based log likelihood method.

AB Emerging data suggest that type 1 diabetes affects not only the beta-cell-containing islets of Langerhans, but also the surrounding exocrine compartment. Using digital pathology, machine learning algorithms were applied to high-resolution, whole-slide images of human pancreata to determine whether the tissue composition in individuals with or at risk for type 1 diabetes differs from those without diabetes. Transplant-grade pancreata from organ donors were evaluated from 16 nondiabetic autoantibody-negative controls, 8 nondiabetic autoantibody-positive subjects with increased type 1 diabetes risk, and 19 persons with type 1 diabetes (0 to 12 years' duration). HALO image analysis algorithms were implemented to compare architecture of the main pancreatic duct as well as cell size, density, and area of acinar, endocrine, ductal, and other nonendocrine, nonexocrine tissues. Type 1 diabetes was found to affect exocrine area, acinar cell density, and size, whereas the type of difference correlated with the presence or absence of insulin-positive cells remaining in the pancreas. These changes were not observed before disease onset, as indicated by modeling cross-sectional data from pancreata of autoantibody-positive subjects and those diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. These data provide novel insights into anatomic differences in type 1 diabetes pancreata and demonstrate that machine learning can be adapted for the evaluation of disease processes from cross-sectional data sets.

AB Compute-in-memory (CiM) has emerged as a promising approach for improving energy efficiency for diverse data-intensive applications. In this paper, we present LUNA-CiM, a lookup table (LUT)-based programmable fabric for flexible and efficient mapping of artificial neural network (ANN) in memory. Its objective is to tackle scalability challenges in LUT-based computation by minimizing hardware, storage elements, and energy consumption. The proposed method utilizes the divide and conquer (D&C) strategy to enhance the scalability of LUT-based computation. For example, in a 4b x 4b lookup table-based multiplier, as one of the main components in ANN, decomposing high-precision operations into lower-precision counterparts leads to a substantial reduction in area overheads, approximately 73% less compared to conventional LUT-based approaches. Importantly, this efficiency gain is achieved without compromising accuracy. Extensive simulations were conducted to validate the performance of the proposed method. The analysis presented in this paper reveals a noteworthy advancement in energy efficiency, indicating a 58% reduction in energy consumption per computation compared to the conventional lookup table approach. Additionally, the introduced approach demonstrates a 36% improvement in speed over the traditional lookup table approach. These findings highlight notable advancements in performance, showcasing the potential of this inventive method to achieve low power, low-area overhead, and fast computations through the utilization of LUTs within an SRAM array.

ID REDUCTION; EXPOSURE
AB Voice recognition has become an integral part of our lives, commonly used in call centers and as part of virtual assistants. However, voice recognition is increasingly applied to more industrial uses. Each of these use cases has unique characteristics that may impact the effectiveness of voice recognition, which could impact industrial productivity, performance, or even safety. One of the most prominent among them is the unique background noises that are dominant in each industry. The existence of different machinery and different work layouts are primary contributors to this. Another important characteristic is the type of communication that is present in these settings. Daily communication often involves longer sentences uttered under relatively silent conditions, whereas communication in industrial settings is often short and conducted in loud conditions. In this study, we demonstrated the importance of taking these two elements into account by comparing the performances of two voice recognition algorithms under several background noise conditions: a regular Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based voice recognition algorithm to an Auto Speech Recognition (ASR)-based model with a denoising module. Our results indicate that there is a significant performance drop between the typical background noise use (white noise) and the rest of the background noises. Also, our custom ASR model with the denoising module outperformed the CNN-based model with an overall performance increase between 14-35% across all background noises. Both results give proof that specialized voice recognition algorithms need to be developed for these environments to reliably deploy them as control mechanisms.

AB The load-carrying capacity of reinforced concrete beams can be compromised by concrete cracking, and the intrusion of moisture, oxygen and salt that cause corrosion of the steel reinforcement. A relatively inexpensive method of repairing such beams is to bond fiber-reinforced composites to the tensile and shear faces of the beams. Unfortunately, the numeric tools used to analyze such beams (notably, finite element analysis (FEM)) are computationally expensive making them slow to arrive at an answer, especially when dealing with complicated three-dimensional composite forms. An empirical solution is therefore proposed that involves the development of a neural network model of the performance of externally reinforced beams, developed from laboratory observations of actual beam behavior.

ID SELECTION
AB Branching on a set of variables, rather than on a single variable, can give tighter bounds at the child nodes and can result in smaller search trees. However, selecting a good set of variables to branch on is even more challenging than selecting a good single variable to branch on. Generalized strong branching extends the strong branching concepts developed for choosing a single variable to choosing a set of variables. As the computational requirements of a full implementation of strong branching are prohibitive, we use extreme gradient boosting to train a model to predict the ranking of (sets of) candidate variables. An extensive computational study using instances from three well-known classes of optimization problems demonstrates that branching on sets of variables outperforms branching on a single variable, that a learned model can be used effectively to select among (sets of) candidate variables, and that the learned strong branching strategies outperform the default branching strategy of state-of-the-art commercial solver CPLEX in terms of both the number of nodes explored in the search tree and the time it takes to explore the search tree.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB Kinematics of total knee replacements (TKR) play an important role in assessing the success of a procedure and would be a valuable addition to clinical practice; however, measuring TKR kinematics is time consuming and labour intensive. Recently, an automatic single-plane fluoroscopic method utilizing machine learning has been developed to facilitate a quick and simple process for measuring TKR kinematics. This study aimed to validate the new automatic single-plane technique using biplanar radiostereometric analysis (RSA) as the gold standard. Twenty-four knees were imaged at various angles of flexion in a dedicated RSA lab and 113 image pairs were obtained. Only the lateral RSA images were used for the automatic single-plane technique to simulate single-plane fluoroscopy. Two networks helped automate the kinematics measurement process, one segmented implant components and the other generated an initial pose estimate for the optimization algorithm. Kinematics obtained via the automatic single plane and manual biplane techniques were compared using root-mean-square error and Bland-Altman plots. Two observers measured the kinematics using the automated technique and results were compared with assess reproducibility. Root-mean-square errors were 0.8 mm for anterior-posterior translation, 0.5 mm for superior-inferior translation, 2.6 mm for medial-lateral translation, 1.0 degrees for flexion-extension, 1.2 degrees for abduction-adduction, and 1.7 degrees for internal-external rotation. Reproducibility, reported as root-mean-square errors between operator measurements, was submillimeter for in-plane translations and below 2 degrees for all rotations. Clinical Significance: The advantages of the automated single plane technique should aid in the kinematic measurement process and help researchers and clinicians perform TKR kinematic analyses.

AB Background: Hospital-induced delirium is one of the most common and costly iatrogenic conditions, and its incidence is predicted to increase as the population of the United States ages. An academic and clinical interdisciplinary systems approach is needed to reduce the frequency and impact of hospital-induced delirium.Objective: The long-term goal of our research is to enhance the safety of hospitalized older adults by reducing iatrogenic conditions through an effective learning health system. In this study, we will develop models for predicting hospital-induced delirium. In order to accomplish this objective, we will create a computable phenotype for our outcome (hospital-induced delirium), design an expert-based traditional logistic regression model, leverage machine learning techniques to generate a model using structured data, and use machine learning and natural language processing to produce an integrated model with components from both structured data and text data.Methods: This study will explore text-based data, such as nursing notes, to improve the predictive capability of prognostic models for hospital-induced delirium. By using supervised and unsupervised text mining in addition to structured data, we will examine multiple types of information in electronic health record data to predict medical-surgical patient risk of developing delirium. Development and validation will be compliant to the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) statement.Results: Work on this project will take place through March 2024. For this study, we will use data from approximately 332,230 encounters that occurred between January 2012 to May 2021. Findings from this project will be disseminated at scientific conferences and in peer-reviewed journals.Conclusions: Success in this study will yield a durable, high-performing research-data infrastructure that will process, extract, and analyze clinical text data in near real time. This model has the potential to be integrated into the electronic health record and provide point-of-care decision support to prevent harm and improve quality of care.

AB BackgroundTeachers often rely on the use of open-ended questions to assess students' conceptual understanding of assigned content. Particularly in the context of mathematics; teachers use these types of questions to gain insight into the processes and strategies adopted by students in solving mathematical problems beyond what is possible through more close-ended problem types. While these types of problems are valuable to teachers, the variation in student responses to these questions makes it difficult, and time-consuming, to evaluate and provide directed feedback. It is a well-studied concept that feedback, both in terms of a numeric score but more importantly in the form of teacher-authored comments, can help guide students as to how to improve, leading to increased learning. It is for this reason that teachers need better support not only for assessing students' work but also in providing meaningful and directed feedback to students. ObjectivesIn this paper, we seek to develop, evaluate, and examine machine learning models that support automated open response assessment and feedback. MethodsWe build upon the prior research in the automatic assessment of student responses to open-ended problems and introduce a novel approach that leverages student log data combined with machine learning and natural language processing methods. Utilizing sentence-level semantic representations of student responses to open-ended questions, we propose a collaborative filtering-based approach to both predict student scores as well as recommend appropriate feedback messages for teachers to send to their students. Results and ConclusionWe find that our method outperforms previously published benchmarks across three different metrics for the task of predicting student performance. Through an error analysis, we identify several areas where future works may be able to improve upon our approach.

AB Traffic crashes present substantial challenges to human safety and socio-economic development in urban areas. Developing a reliable and responsible traffic crash prediction model is crucial to address growing public safety concerns and improve the safety of urban mobility systems. Traditional methods face limitations at fine spatiotemporal scales due to the sporadic nature of high-risk crashes and the predominance of non-crash characteristics. Furthermore, while most current models show promising occurrence prediction, they overlook the uncertainties arising from the inherent nature of crashes, and then fail to adequately map the hierarchical ranking of crash risk values for more precise insights. To address these issues, we introduce the S patio t emporal Z ero-Inflated I nflated T wee d ie G raph N eural N etworks (STZITD-GNN), the first uncertainty-aware probabilistic graph deep learning model in road-level daily-basis traffic crash prediction for multi-steps. Our model combines the interpretability of the statistical Tweedie family with the predictive power of graph neural networks, excelling in predicting a comprehensive range of crash risks. The decoder employs a compound Tweedie model, handling the non-Gaussian distribution inherent in crash data, with a zero-inflated component for accurately identifying non-crash cases and low-risk roads. The model accurately predicts and differentiates between high-risk, low-risk, and no-risk scenarios, providing a holistic view of road safety that accounts for the full spectrum of probability and severity of crashes. Empirical tests using real-world traffic data from London, UK, demonstrate that the STZITD-GNN surpasses other baseline models across multiple benchmarks, including a reduction in regression error of up to 34.60% in point estimation metrics and an improvement of above 47% in interval-based uncertainty metrics.

ID SPATIAL CAPTURE-RECAPTURE
AB Camera trapping is the most widely used data collection method for estimating snow leopard (Panthera uncia) abundance; however, the accuracy of this method is limited by human observer errors from misclassifying individuals in camera trap images. We evaluated the extent Whiskerbook (www.whiskerbook.org), an artificial intelligence (AI) software, could reduce this error rate and enhance the accuracy of capture-recapture abundance estimates. Using 439 images of 34 captive snow leopard individuals, classification was performed by five observers with prior experience in individual snow leopard ID ( "experts ") and five observers with no such experience ( "novices "). The "expert " observers classified 35 out of 34 snow leopard individuals, on average erroneously splitting one individual into two, thus resulting in a higher number than true individuals. The success rate of experts was 90 %, with less than a 3 % error in estimating the population size in capture-recapture modeling. However, the "novice " observers successfully matched 71 % of encounters, recognizing 25 out of 34 individuals, underestimating the population by 25 %. It was found that expert observers significantly outperformed novice observers, making statistically fewer errors (Mann Whitney U test P = 0.01) and finding the true number of individuals (P = 0.01). These differences were contrasted with a previous study by Johansson et al. 2020, using the same subset of 16 individuals from European zoos. With the help of AI and the Whiskerbook platform, "experts " were able to match 87 % of encounters and identify 15 out of 16 individuals, with modeled estimates of 16 +/- 1 individuals. In contrast, "novices " were 63 % accurate in matching encounters and identified 12 out of 16 individuals, modeling 12 +/- 1 individuals that underestimated the population size by 12 %. When comparing the performance of observers using AI and the Whiskerbook platform to observers performing the tasks manually, we found that observers using Whiskerbook made significantly fewer errors in splitting one individual into two (P = 0.04). However, there were also a significantly higher number of combination errors, where two individuals were combined into one (P = 0.01). Specifically, combination errors were found to be made by "novices " (P = 0.04). Although AI benefited both expert and novice observers, expert observers outperformed novices. Our results suggest that AI effectively reduced the misclassification of individual snow leopards in camera trap studies, improving abundance estimates. However, even with AI support, expert observers were needed to obtain the most accurate estimates.

AB Generalized canonical correlation analysis (GCCA) integrates information from data samples that are acquired at multiple feature spaces (or 'views') to produce low-dimensional representations-which is an extension of classical two-view CCA. Since the 1960s, (G)CCA has attracted much attention in statistics, machine learning, and data mining because of its importance in data analytics. Despite these efforts, the existing GCCA algorithms have serious complexity issues. The memory and computational complexities of the existing algorithms usually grow as a quadratic and cubic function of the problem dimension (the number of samples / features), respectively-e.g., handling views with approximate to 1,000 features using such algorithms already occupies approximate to 10(6) memory and the per-iteration complexity is approximate to 10(9) flops-which makes it hard to push these methods much further. To circumvent such difficulties, we first propose a GCCA algorithm whose memory and computational costs scale linearly in the problem dimension and the number of nonzero data elements, respectively. Consequently, the proposed algorithm can easily handle very large sparse views whose sample and feature dimensions both exceed approximate to 100,000. Our second contribution lies in proposing two distributed algorithms for GCCA, which compute the canonical components of different views in parallel and thus can further reduce the runtime significantly if multiple computing agents are available. We provide detailed convergence analyses of the proposed algorithms and show that all the large-scale GCCA algorithms converge to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point at least sublinearly. Judiciously designed synthetic and real-data experiments are employed to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

AB With the unceasing advancement of novel digital technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) is projected to change and challenge established social dynamics. As such, a deeper understanding of AI and its impacts will prove to be crucial in an AI-enriched world. In the current study, we focus on an emerging AI-based technology, deepfakes, and investigate the effects of a lesser-known use of deepfakes (i.e., using deepfakes for prosocial purposes). Specifically, we examine the impacts of exposure to a "deepfake resurrection" narrative on individuals' policy support and activism intentions in two contexts (i.e., drunk driving and domestic violence). We conducted a between-subjects experiment (N = 1990) that varied in the use (vs. non-use) of deepfakes and tested four psy-chological processes related to the effects of deepfake resurrection narratives. While the moderating role of point of view and the mediating role of perceived desecration of the dead did not receive much support, the narrative-based and the surprise-focused mediational pathways were shown to be important mechanisms of deepfake resurrection narratives. Finally, we reflect on the potential of prosocial deepfakes and deepfake resurrection narratives and discuss the findings' relevance to both theory and practice.

AB As the prevalence of AI-generated content increases, examining viewers' perceptions of the content is crucial to understanding the human-machine relationship and further facilitating efficient human-machine collaboration. Prior literature has accumulated mixed findings regarding subjects' attitudes toward and perceptions of news and tweets written by natural language generation (NLG) algorithms. To resolve this inconsistency and expand our understanding beyond NLG, this study investigated the explicit and implicit perceptions of AI-generated poetry and painting held by subjects from two societies. An experimental survey was conducted to examine the subjects' explicit and implicit perceptions of AI-generated content in the U.S. and China. As the U.S. and China fiercely compete to lead the development of AI technology, their citizens exhibit divergent attitudes toward AI's performance in artistic work. The U.S. subjects were more critical of the AI-than the human-generated content, both explicitly and implicitly. Although the Chinese subjects were overtly positive about the AI-generated content, they appreciated less this content than the human-authored content. The findings enrich our understanding in the domain of AI generation. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB In this work, we study the possibility of defending against data-poisoning attacks while training a shallow neural network in a regression setup. We focus on doing supervised learning with realizable labels for a class of depth-2 finite-width neural networks, which includes single-filter convolutional networks. In this class of networks, we attempt to learn the true network weights generating the labels in the presence of a malicious oracle doing stochastic, bounded and additive adversarial distortions on the true labels, during training. For the gradient-free stochastic algorithm that we construct, we prove worstcase near-optimal trade-offs among the magnitude of the adversarial attack, the weight approximation accuracy, and the confidence achieved by the proposed algorithm. As our algorithm uses minibatching, we analyze how the mini-batch size affects convergence. We also show how to utilize the scaling of the outer layer weights to counter data-poisoning attacks on true labels depending on the probability of attack. Lastly, we give experimental evidence demonstrating how our algorithm outperforms stochastic gradient descent under different input data distributions, including instances of heavy-tailed distributions.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Neuroplasticity is key to the operation of brain machine interfaces (BMIs) a direct communication pathway between the brain and a man-made computing device. Whereas exogenous BMIs that associate volitional control of brain activity with neurofeedback have been shown to induce long lasting plasticity, endogenous BMIs that use prolonged activity-dependent stimulation- and thus may curtail the time scale that governs natural sensorimotor integration loops-have been shown to induce short lasting plasticity. Here we summarize recent findings from studies using both categories of BMIs, and discuss the fundamental principles that may underlie their operation and the longevity of the plasticity they induce. We draw comparison to plasticity mechanisms known to mediate natural sensorimotor skill learning and discuss principles of homeostatic regulation that may constrain endogenous BMI effects in the adult mammalian brain. We propose that BMIs could be designed to facilitate structural and functional plasticity for the purpose of re-organization of target brain regions and directed augmentation of sensorimotor maps, and suggest possible avenues for future work to maximize their efficacy and viability in clinical applications.

AB Objective Image-guided procedures have become a mainstay of modern health care. This article reviews how human operators process imaging data and use it to plan procedures and make intraprocedural decisions.
   Methods A series of models from human factors research, communication theory, and organizational learning were applied to the human-machine interface that occupies the center stage during image-guided procedures.
   Results Together, these models suggest several opportunities for improving performance as follows: 1. Performance will depend not only on the operator's skill but also on the knowledge embedded in the imaging technology, available tools, and existing protocols. 2. Voluntary movements consist of planning and execution phases. Performance subscores should be developed that assess quality and efficiency during each phase. For procedures involving ionizing radiation (fluoroscopy and computed tomography), radiation metrics can be used to assess performance. 3. At a basic level, these procedures consist of advancing a tool to a specific location within a patient and using the tool. Paradigms from mapping and navigation should be applied to image-guided procedures. 4. Recording the content of the imaging system allows one to reconstruct the stimulus/response cycles that occur during image-guided procedures.
   Conclusions When compared with traditional open procedures, the technology used during image-guided procedures places an imaging system and long thin tools between the operator and the patient. Taking a step back and reexamining how information flows through an imaging system and how actions are conveyed through human-machine interfaces suggest that much can be learned from studying system failures. In the same way that flight data recorders revolutionized accident investigations in aviation, much could be learned from recording video data during image-guided procedures.

ID DIGITAL TWIN
AB Predictive maintenance of built assets often relies on scheduled routine practices that are disconnected from real-time stress assessment, degradation and defects. However, while Digital Twin (DT) technology within building and urban studies is maturing rapidly, its use in predictive maintenance is limited. Traditional preventive and reactive maintenance strategies that are more prevalent in facility management are not intuitive, not resource efficient, cannot prevent failure and either underserve the asset or are surplus to requirements. City Information Modeling (CIM) refers to a federation of BIM models in accordance with real-world geospatial references, and it can be deployed as an Urban Digital Twin (UDT) at city level, like BIM's deployment at building level. This study presents a systematic review of 105 Scopus-indexed papers to establish current trends, gaps and opportunities for a cognitive predictive maintenance framework in the architecture, engineering, construction and operations (AECO) industry. A UDT framework consisting of the CIM of a section of the University of Florida campus is proposed to bridge the knowledge gap highlighted in the systematic review. The framework illustrates the potential for CNN-IoT integration to improve predictive maintenance through advance notifications. It also eliminates the use of centralized information archiving.

AB Firefighters are often exposed to extensive wayfinding information in various formats owing to the increasing complexity of the built environment. Because of the individual differences in processing assorted types of information, a personalized cognition-driven intelligent system is necessary to reduce the cognitive load and improve the performance in the wayfinding tasks. However, the mixed and multi-dimensional information during the wayfinding tasks bring severe challenges to intelligent systems in detecting and nowcasting the attention of users. In this research, a virtual wayfinding experiment is designed to simulate the human response when subjects are memorizing or recalling different wayfinding information. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are designed for automated attention detection based on the power spectrum density of electroencephalography (EEG) data collected during the experiment. The performance of the personalized model and the generalized model are compared and the result shows a personalized CNN is a powerful classifier in detecting the attention of users with high accuracy and efficiency. The study thus will serve a foundation to support the future development of personalized cognition-driven intelligent systems.

AB A novel method for predicting maximum recommended therapeutic dose (MRTD) is presented using quantitative structure property relationships (QSPRs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). MRTD data of 31 structurally diverse Antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) were collected from FDA MRTD Database or package inserts. Molecular property descriptors of each compound, that is, molecular mass, aqueous solubility, lipophilicity, biotransformation half life, oxidation half life, and biodegradation probability were calculated from their SMILES codes. A training set (n = 23) was used to construct multiple linear regression and back propagation neural network models. The models were validated using an external test set (n = 8) which demonstrated that MRTD values may be predicted with reasonable accuracy. Model predictability was described by root mean squared errors (RMSEs), Kendall's correlation coefficients (tau), P-values, and Bland Altman plots for method comparisons. MRTD was predicted by a 6-3-1 neural network model (RMSE = 13.67, tau = 0.643, P = 0.035) more accurately than by the multiple linear regression (RMSE = 27.27, tau = 0.714, P = 0.019) model. Both models illustrated a moderate correlation between aqueous solubility of antiretroviral drugs and maximum therapeutic dose. MRTD prediction may assist in the design of safer, more effective treatments for HIV infection.

AB Machine Learning (ML) models have been developed to predict perioperative clinical parameters. The objective of this study was to determine if ML models can serve as decision aids to improve anesthesiologists' prediction of peak intraoperative glucose values and postoperative opioid requirements. A web-based tool was used to present actual surgical case and patient information to 10 practicing anesthesiologists. They were asked to predict peak glucose levels and post-operative opioid requirements for 100 surgical patients with and without presenting ML model estimations of peak glucose and opioid requirements. The accuracies of the anesthesiologists' estimates with and without ML estimates as reference were compared. A questionnaire was also sent to the participating anesthesiologists to obtain their feedback on ML decision support. The accuracy of peak glucose level estimates by the anesthesiologists increased from 79.0 +/- 13.7% without ML assistance to 84.7 +/- 11.5% (< 0.001) when ML estimates were provided as reference. The accuracy of opioid requirement estimates increased from 18% without ML assistance to 42% (p < 0.001) when ML estimates were provided as reference. When ML estimates were provided, predictions of peak glucose improved for 8 out of the 10 anesthesiologists, while predictions of opioid requirements improved for 7 of the 10 anesthesiologists. Feedback questionnaire responses revealed that the anesthesiologist primarily used the ML estimates as reference to modify their clinical judgement. ML models can improve anesthesiologists' estimation of clinical parameters. ML predictions primarily served as reference information that modified an anesthesiologist's clinical estimate.

ID STABLE ADAPTIVE-CONTROL; ASYMPTOTIC TRACKING; ROBOT MANIPULATORS;
   SYSTEMS
AB With the motivation of using more information to update the parameter estimates to achieve improved tracking performance, composite adaptation that uses both the system tracking errors and a prediction error containing parametric information to drive the update laws, has become widespread in adaptive control literature. However, despite its obvious benefits, composite adaptation has not been widely implemented in neural network-based control, primarily due to the neural network (NN) reconstruction error that destroys a typical prediction error formulation required for the composite adaptation. This technical note presents a novel approach to design a composite adaptation law for NNs by devising an innovative swapping procedure that uses the recently developed robust integral of the sign of the error (RISE) feedback method. Semi-global asymptotic tracking is proven for a Euler-Lagrange system. Experimental results are provided to illustrate the concept.

AB As organizations increasingly adopt artificial intelligence (AI) systems for their online communication with publics, conceptualizing and operationalizing perceived humanness presents an important challenge to understanding how consumers and other publics respond to both AI and human agents in live chats with organizations. This study develops a measure of consumer-perceived humanness derived from three related constructs: conversational human voice, anthropomorphism, and social presence. The new measure was tested for reliability and validity, including tests of criterion validity predicting how it would relate to perceived relational investment and trust as relational outcomes. Two online studies (N-1 = 172, N-2 = 375) were conducted in which participants interacted with either human or machine online chat agents. Greater perceived humanness of chat agents was found to correlate with greater perceived relational investment and trust in the organization, with perceived relational investment mediating the relationship between perceived humanness and trust. Perceived humanness can be utilized subsequently to assess both human and machine agents. Its corollary, perceived machineness, was also identified as a separate factor to be taken into consideration in future research and theory building.

AB The urban traffic flow prediction is a significant issue in the intelligent transportation system. In consideration of nonlinear and spatial-temporal features of urban traffic data, we propose a deep hybrid neural network improved by greedy algorithm for urban traffic flow prediction with taxi GPS trace. The proposed deep neural network model first combines the convolutional neural network (CNN), which extracts the spatial features, with the long short term memory (LSTM), which captures the temporal information, to predict urban traffic flow. Then, the proposed model is trained by a greedy policy to short time consumption and improves accuracy when a network goes deeper. Experimental results with real taxis GPS trajectory data from Xi'an city show that the improved deep hybrid CNN-LSTM model can achieve higher prediction accuracy and shorter time consumption compared with existing methods.

AB Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) paired with cognitive training (CT) is widely inves-tigated as a therapeutic tool to enhance cognitive function in older adults with and without neurodegenerative disease. Prior research demonstrates that the level of benefit from tDCS paired with CT varies from person to person, likely due to individual differences in neuroanatomical structure.Objective: The current study aims to develop a method to objectively optimize and personalize current dosage to maximize the functional gains of non-invasive brain stimulation.Methods: A support vector machine (SVM) model was trained to predict treatment response based on compu-tational models of current density in a sample dataset (n = 14). Feature weights of the deployed SVM were used in a weighted Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to maximize the likelihood of converting tDCS non-responders to responders by finding the most optimum electrode montage and applied current intensity (optimized models).Results: Current distributions optimized by the proposed SVM-GMM model demonstrated 93% voxel-wise coherence within target brain regions between the originally non-responders and responders. The optimized current distribution in original non-responders was 3.38 standard deviations closer to the current dose of re-sponders compared to the pre-optimized models. Optimized models also achieved an average treatment response likelihood and normalized mutual information of 99.993% and 91.21%, respectively. Following tDCS dose optimization, the SVM model successfully predicted all tDCS non-responders with optimized doses as responders. Conclusions: The results of this study serve as a foundation for a custom dose optimization strategy towards precision medicine in tDCS to improve outcomes in cognitive decline remediation for older adults.

AB This paper studies a general class of dynamical neural networks with lateral inhibition, exhibiting winner-take-all (WTA) behavior. These networks are motivated by a metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET) implementation of neural networks, in which mutual competition plays a very important role. We show that for a fairly general class of competitive neural networks, WTA behavior exists. Sufficient conditions for the network to have a WTA equilibrium are obtained, and rigorous convergence analysis is carried out. The conditions for the network to have the WTA behavior obtained in this paper provide design guidelines for the network implementation and fabrication. We also demonstrate that whenever the network gets into the WTA region, it will stay in that region and settle down exponentially fast to the WTA point. This provides a speeding procedure for the decision making: as soon as it gets into the region, the winner can be declared. Finally, we show that this WTA neural network has a self-resetting property, and a resetting principle is proposed.

ID TEXTURE
AB The potential environmental impact of herbicide utilisation has stimulated research into new methods of weed control. Selective herbicide application offers the possibility to reduce herbicide usage while maintaining weed control. The research reported utilised colour co-occurrence method (CCM) texture analysis techniques to evaluate three different neural-network classifiers for potential use in real-time weed control systems. An image data set consisting of 33 unique texture features for each image in a six class data set (40 images per class) was generated for the following classes; foxtail, crabgrass, common lambsquarter, velvetleaf, morning-glory, and clear soil surface. The data sets were evaluated using a stepwise variable selection procedure to provide six unique data models separated according to hue-saturation-intensity colour features. A comparison study of the classification capabilities of three neural-network models (backpropagation, counterpropagation, and radial basis function) was conducted. It was found that the backpropagation neural-network classifier provided the best classification performance and was capable of classification accuracies of 97%, which exceeded traditional statistical classification procedure accuracy of 93%. When comparing the three neural-network methodologies, the backpropagation method not only achieved a higher classification accuracy, but also had less computational requirements.

DT Article
AB In this work, we use the coherent WaveBurst (cWB) pipeline enhanced with machine learning (ML) to search for binary black hole (BBH) mergers in the Advanced LIGO-Virgo strain data from the third observing run. We detect, with equivalent or higher significance, all gravitational-wave (GW) events previously reported by the standard cWB search for BBH mergers in the third GW Transient Catalog. The ML-enhanced cWB search identifies five additional GW candidate events from the catalog that were previously missed by the standard cWB search. Moreover, we identify three marginal candidate events not listed in third GW Transient Catalog. For simulated events distributed uniformly in a fiducial volume, we improve the sensitive hypervolume with respect to the standard cWB search by approximately 28% and 34% for the stellar-mass and intermediate mass black hole binary mergers respectively, detected with a false-alarm rate less than 1/100 yr???1. We show the robustness of the ML-enhanced search for detection of generic BBH signals by reporting increased sensitivity to the spin-precessing and eccentric BBH events as compared to the standard cWB search. Furthermore, we compare the improvement of the ML-enhanced cWB search for different detector networks.

AB The paper describes a method of modeling the dynamic behaviour of continuous engineering processes, using artificial neural networks. The technique is applicable to situations where the differential equations governing the behaviour of a system are nonlinear and poorly understood, such as is the case for frost-heave and thaw-settlement processes in soils. A means of modeling the unknown component of governing differential equations is first described. A method of discretizing the neural network models of these equations is then illustrated, and the way in which these networks can be used to simulate the behaviour of a process is discussed. The proposed approach is proven to provide highly accurate results in a series of experiments simulating the nonlinear thermal behaviour of translucent solid materials. The paper concludes with an identification of several on-going areas of further development and application of the proposed tool. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although the twin support vector regression (TSVR) method has been widely studied and various variants are successfully developed, the structural risk minimization (SRM) principle and model's sparseness are not given sufficient consideration. In this paper, a novel nonparallel support vector regression (NPSVR) is proposed in spirit of nonparallel support vector machine (NPSVM), which outperforms existing twin support vector regression (TSVR) methods in the following terms: (1) For each primal problem, a regularized term is added by rigidly following the SRM principle so that the kernel trick can be applied directly to the dual problems for the nonlinear case without considering an extra kernel-generated surface; (2) An epsilon-insensitive loss function is adopted to remain inherent sparseness as the standard support vector regression (SVR); (3) The dual problems have the same formulation with that of the standard SVR, so computing inverse matrix is well avoided and a sequential minimization optimization (SMO)-type solver is exclusively designed to accelerate the training for large-scale datasets; (4) The primal problems can approximately degenerate to those of the existing TSVRs if corresponding parameters are appropriately chosen. Numerical experiments on diverse datasets have verified the effectiveness of our proposed NPSVR in sparseness, generalization ability and scalability. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The vertical lobe (VL) in the octopus brain plays an essential role in its sophisticated learning and memory. Early anatomical studies suggested that the VL is organized in a "fan-out fan-in" connectivity matrix comprising only three morphologically identified neuron types; input axons from the median superior frontal lobe (MSFL) innervating en passant millions of small amacrine interneurons (AMs), which converge sharply onto large VL output neurons (LNs). Recent physiological studies confirmed the feedforward excitatory connectivity; a glutamatergic synapse at the first MSFL-to-AM synaptic layer and a cholinergic AM-to-LNs synapse. MSFL-to-AMs synapses show a robust hippocampal-like activity-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) of transmitter release. 5-HT, octopamine, dopamine and nitric oxide modulate short- and long-term VL synaptic plasticity. Here, we present a comprehensive histolabeling study to better characterize the neural elements in the VL. We generally confirmed glutamatergic MSFLs and cholinergic AMs. Intense labeling for NOS activity in the AMs neurites were in-line with the NO-dependent presynaptic LTP mechanism at the MSFL-to-AM synapse. New discoveries here reveal more heterogeneity of the VL neurons than previously thought. GABAergic AMs suggest a subpopulation of inhibitory interneurons in the first input layer. Clear gamma-amino butyric acid labeling in the cell bodies of LNs supported an inhibitory VL output, yet the LNs co-expressed FMRFamide-like neuropeptides, suggesting an additional neuromodulatory role of the VL output. Furthermore, a group of LNs was glutamatergic. A new cluster of cells organized as a "deep nucleus" showed rich catecholaminergic labeling and may play a role in intrinsic neuromodulation. In-situ hybridization and immunolabeling allowed characterization and localization of a rich array of neuropeptides and neuromodulators, likely involved in reward/punishment signals. This analysis of the fast transmission system, together with the newly found cellular elements, help integrate behavioral, physiological, pharmacological and connectome findings into a more comprehensive understanding of an efficient learning and memory network.

AB The paper proposes a hybrid numerical-neural-network model developed based on the simulation of unheated and uncooled indoor temperature and humidity for buildings. This model is initiated with a numerical simulation and the output is then passed to a neural network for calibration. This approach utilizes both numerical and neural network models and it can analyze the influences of specific parameters on building performances without sacrificing accuracy and generalizability. An experimental study was conducted using a simulation of unheated and uncooled indoor temperature in a sports hall with a non-operating hour ventilation rate that is about half that of the operating hour rate. Several cases were examined. The indoor temperatures simulated by the hybrid model were more accurate than predictions by the numerical model alone for all cases. Particularly, results indicate that the hybrid model can generalize about a building parameter having only a constant value in training data, which a conventional neural network model cannot do that. More importantly, the hybrid model is adaptable for other building simulations, which is the main value of this model. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A quantitative procedure was developed to predict the composition of ternary ground spice mixtures using an electronic nose. Basil, cinnamon, and garlic were mixed in different compositions and presented to an e-nose. Nineteen training mixtures were used to build predictive models. Model performance was tested using 5 other mixtures. Three neural network structures-multilayer perceptron (MLP), MLP using principal component analysis as a preprocessor (PCA-MLP), and the time-delay neural network (TDNN)-were used for predictive model building. All 3 neural network models predicted the testing mixtures' compositions with a mean square error (MSE) equal or less than 0.0051 (in a fraction domain where sum of fractions = 1). The TDNN provided the smallest MSE.

AB Drawing from Moral Foundation Theory, our study explores if and how corrective messages and misinformation related to COVID-19 vaccines utilize moral frames. Unlike studies that either focused on content-analyzing messages or study how audiences react to moral frames, this study incorporated both a content analysis of COVID vaccine messages and modeling of how millions of audiences reacted to such messages. We combined semantic network analysis, text-mining, and machine learning to analyze a large corpus of Facebook posts about COVID-19 vaccines. Our results showed that both corrective messages and misinformation prevalently deployed moral framing. We also found that while corrective messages tend to highlight the virtuous aspect of morality, misinformation focuses on the sinful aspect. In both contexts, the five moral frames could construct logically self-consistent worldviews. Moreover, for corrective messages, fairness, sanctity, care, authority, and loyalty frames all significantly influence users' message sharing. For misinformation, only the authority/subversion frame was influential.

AB In a previous paper (N. Bodor, A. Harget and M.-J. Huang, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 113 (1991) 9480) we demonstrated the utility of a neural network approach in the estimation of the aqueous solubility of organic compounds. This approach has now been extended to the prediction of partition coefficients. A training set of AM1 calculated properties and experimental values for 302 compounds was used and, after training, the neural network was tested for its ability to predict the partition coefficients of 21 compounds not included in the training set. We also tested six more compounds with molecular properties out of the training set property range. A comparison was made with the results obtained from a previous study which had used a regression analysis approach (N. Bodor and M.-J. Huang, J. Pharm. Sci., 81 (1992) 272). The neural network results compared favorably with those given by the regression analysis approach, both for the training set and for the new compounds.

AB Topological relationships between spatial objects in the two-dimensional space have been investigated for a long time in a number of disciplines like artificial intelligence, cognitive science, linguistics, and robotics. In the context of spatial databases and geographical information systems, as predicates they especially support the design of suitable query languages for spatial data retrieval and analysis. But so far, they have only been defined for simplified abstractions of spatial objects like continuous lines and simple regions. With the introduction of complex spatial data types in spatial data models and extensions of commercial database systems, an issue arises regarding the design, definition, and number of topological relationships operating on these complex types. This paper first introduces a formally defined, conceptual model of general and versatile spatial data types for complex lines and complex regions. Based on the well known 9-intersection model, it then formally determines the complete set of mutually exclusive topological relationships between complex lines and complex regions. Completeness and mutual exclusion are shown by a proof technique called proof-by-constraint-and-drawing.

AB Breathing is dynamically modulated by metabolic needs as well as by emotional states. Even though rodents are invaluable models for investigating the neural control of respiration, current literature lacks systematic characterization of breathing dynamics across a broad spectrum of rodent behaviors. Here we uncover a wide diversity in breathing patterns across spontaneous, attractive odor-, stress-, and fear-induced behaviors in mice. Direct recordings of intranasal pressure afford more detailed respiratory information than more traditional whole-body plethysmography. K-means clustering groups 11well-defined behavioral states into four clusters with distinct key respiratory features. Furthermore, we implement RUSBoost (random undersampling boost) classification, a supervised machine learning model, and find that breathing patterns can separate these behaviors with an accuracy of 80%. Taken together, our findings highlight the tight relationship between breathing and behavior and the potential use of breathing patterns to aid in distinguishing similar behaviors and inform about their internal states.

AB BACKGROUND: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) in conjunction with recent updates in dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) management guidelines emphasizes the necessity for innovative models to predict ischemic or bleeding events after drug-eluting stent implantation. Leveraging AI for dynamic prediction has the potential to revolutionize risk stratification and provide personalized decision support for DAPT management.
   METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed and validated a new AI-based pipeline using retrospective data of drug-eluting stent-treated patients, sourced from the Cerner Health Facts data set (n=98 236) and Optum's de-identified Clinformatics Data Mart Database (n=9978). The 36 months following drug-eluting stent implantation were designated as our primary forecasting interval, further segmented into 6 sequential prediction windows. We evaluated 5 distinct AI algorithms for their precision in predicting ischemic and bleeding risks. Model discriminative accuracy was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, among other metrics. The weighted light gradient boosting machine stood out as the preeminent model, thus earning its place as our AI-DAPT model. The AI-DAPT demonstrated peak accuracy in the 30 to 36 months window, charting an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 90% [95% CI, 88%-92%] for ischemia and 84% [95% CI, 82%-87%] for bleeding predictions.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our AI-DAPT excels in formulating iterative, refined dynamic predictions by assimilating ongoing updates from patients' clinical profiles, holding value as a novel smart clinical tool to facilitate optimal DAPT duration management with high accuracy and adaptability.

AB Customers may not wish to use an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot after knowing its nonhu-man identity. Based on the inoculation theory, this study explores how to increase customers' willingness to communicate with AI chatbots by adopting a double-sided message strategy after AI's nonhuman identity is disclosed through one field experiment in a hotel and three on -line vignette experiments. Results indicate that a double-sided message strategy enhances cus-tomers' willingness to interact with AI chatbots via the mediating role of perceived authenticity. Furthermore, the study highlights that customers' attitudes toward interacting with AI chatbots are moderated by customer demand types-complaints and inquiries. This study proposes an effective solution to customers' rejection of AI chatbots.(c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Critical pedagogies provide the tools for students and instructors to challenge the institutions and assumptions inherent in nonprofit education and practice that perpetuate the wicked problems of public service. Because of the high demand for online courses in nonprofit education, elements that have made critical pedagogy effective must find their place in the delivery of online education. We conducted a deep dive into the scholarship of nonprofit education to operationalize critical pedagogy. The discipline of nonprofit education possesses the tools of critical pedagogy in the faceto-face classroom but little evidence of online techniques. We synthesized pedagogical practice to incorporate critical pedagogy in the online nonprofit classroom. We provide a teaching schema rooted in critical pedagogy.

AB Aquatic environments encompass the world's most extensive habitats, rich with sounds produced by a diversity of animals. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) is an increasingly accessible remote sensing technology that uses hydrophones to listen to the underwater world and represents an unprecedented, non-invasive method to monitor underwater environments. This information can assist in the delineation of biologically important areas via detection of sound-producing species or characterization of ecosystem type and condition, inferred from the acoustic properties of the local soundscape. At a time when worldwide biodiversity is in significant decline and underwater soundscapes are being altered as a result of anthropogenic impacts, there is a need to document, quantify, and understand biotic sound sources-potentially before they disappear. A significant step toward these goals is the development of a web-based, open-access platform that provides: (1) a reference library of known and unknown biological sound sources (by integrating and expanding existing libraries around the world); (2) a data repository portal for annotated and unannotated audio recordings of single sources and of soundscapes; (3) a training platform for artificial intelligence algorithms for signal detection and classification; and (4) a citizen science-based application for public users. Although individually, these resources are often met on regional and taxa-specific scales, many are not sustained and, collectively, an enduring global database with an integrated platform has not been realized. We discuss the benefits such a program can provide, previous calls for global data-sharing and reference libraries, and the challenges that need to be overcome to bring together bio- and ecoacousticians, bioinformaticians, propagation experts, web engineers, and signal processing specialists (e.g., artificial intelligence) with the necessary support and funding to build a sustainable and scalable platform that could address the needs of all contributors and stakeholders into the future.

   ENHANCEMENT
AB The development of a safe and efficacious vaccine that provides immunity against all four dengue virus serotypes is a priority, and a significant challenge for vaccine development has been defining and measuring serotype-specific outcomes and correlates of protection. The plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT) is the gold standard assay for measuring serotype-specific antibodies, but this test cannot differentiate homotypic and heterotypic antibodies and characterising the infection history is challenging. To address this, we present an analysis of pre- and post-infection antibody titres measured using the PRNT, collected from a prospective cohort of Thai children. We applied four machine learning classifiers and multinomial logistic regression to the titre data to predict the infecting serotype. The models were validated against the true infecting serotype, identified using RT-PCR. Model performance was calculated using 100 bootstrap samples of the train and out-of-sample test sets. Our analysis showed that, on average, the greatest change in titre was against the infecting serotype. However, in 53.4% (109/204) of the subjects, the highest titre change did not correspond to the infecting serotype, including in 34.3% (11/35) of dengue-na & iuml;ve individuals (although 8/11 of these seronegative individuals were seropositive to Japanese encephalitis virus prior to their infection). The highest post-infection titres of seropositive cases were more likely to match the serotype of the highest pre-infection titre than the infecting serotype, consistent with antigenic seniority or cross-reactive boosting of pre-infection titres. Despite these challenges, the best performing machine learning algorithm achieved 76.3% (95% CI 57.9-89.5%) accuracy on the out-of-sample test set in predicting the infecting serotype from PRNT data. Incorporating additional spatiotemporal data improved accuracy to 80.6% (95% CI 63.2-94.7%), while using only post-infection titres as predictor variables yielded an accuracy of 71.7% (95% CI 57.9-84.2%). These results show that machine learning classifiers can be used to overcome challenges in interpreting PRNT titres, making them useful tools in investigating dengue immune dynamics, infection history and identifying serotype-specific correlates of protection, which in turn can support the evaluation of clinical trial endpoints and vaccine development.

AB Brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) aim to translate the motor intent of locked-ill patients into neuroprosthetic control commands Electrocorticographical (ECoG) signals provide promising neural inputs to BMIs as shown in recent studies In this paper, we utilize a broadband spectrum above the fast gamma ranges and systematically Study the role of spectral resolution, in which the broadband is partitioned, oil the reconstruction of the patients' hand trajectories Traditionally, the power of ECoG rhythms (<200-300 Hz) has been computed in short duration bins and instantaneously and linearly mapped to cursor trajectories Neither time embedding, nor nonlinear mappings have been previously implemented in ECoG neuroprosthesis Herein, mapping of neural Modulations to goal-oriented motor behavior is achieved via linear adaptive filters with embedded memory depths and as a novelty through echo state networks (ESNs), which provide nonlinear mappings Without compromising training complexity or increasing the number of model parameters, with Lip to 85% correlation Reconstructed hand trajectories are analyzed through spatial, spectral and temporal sensitivities. The Superiority Of nonlinear mappings in the cases of low spectral resolution and abundance of interictal activity is discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB BackgroundAlzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC) and Lewy pathology (LP) often coexist in cognitively impaired individuals. These pathologies' relative distribution and severity may modify these individuals' clinical presentation, cognitive profile, and prognosis. Therefore, we examined the contributions of LP and concomitant ADNC to disease survival and profiles of cognitive decline in preclinical and clinical stages in a large neuropathologically diagnosed group.MethodsWe evaluated 597 participants with LP and 491 participants with intermediate/high ADNC in the absence of LP from the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center (NACC) database. At baseline, 237 participants were cognitively normal (CN), 255 were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 596 with dementia. Cognition was assessed using three cognitive domain scores (i.e., Memory, Executive, and Language) from the NACC Uniform Dataset (UDS) neuropsychological test battery, MMSE, and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). Multivariate adaptive regression splines were used to evaluate associations between baseline cognitive scores and mean annual rate of change over two years. The likelihood of progression to MCI or dementia was assessed using Cox hazard models.ResultsNeocortical LP, independent of the clinical diagnosis, was associated with lower Executive and higher Language and Memory scores at baseline, whereas Braak V-VI neurofibrillary tangle pathology was associated with lower Memory and Language scores. Similarly, neocortical LP was associated with faster Executive decline, whereas Braak V-VI neurofibrillary tangle pathology was associated with faster Memory and Language decline. A clinical diagnosis of Lewy Body Dementia (i.e., a strong LP phenotype) was associated with the LP cognitive profile and shorter disease duration. Progression to incident MCI or dementia was primarily associated with the degree of tau pathology; neocortical LP or a diagnosis of Lewy Body Dementia only predicted progression when those with intermediate/high ADNC were excluded.ConclusionsLP and ADNC differentially affected cross-sectional and longitudinal cognitive profiles in a large autopsy sample. Concomitant Braak V-VI neurofibrillary tangle pathology had a strong impact on clinical progression in those with LP, regardless of the initial stage. Thus, LB and ADNC co-pathology interact to affect cognitive domains that may be used to track Lewy Body disease longitudinally and as outcome measures in therapeutic trials.

AB The objective was to identify a set of genes whose transcript abundance is predictive of a cow's ability to become pregnant following artificial insemination. Endometrial epithelial cells from the uterine body were collected for RNA sequencing using the cytobrush method from 193 first-service Holstein cows at estrus prior to artificial insemination (day 0). A group of 253 first-service cows not used for cytobrush collection were controls. There was no effect of cytobrush collection on pregnancy outcomes at day 30 or 70 or on pregnancy loss between days 30 and 70. There were 2 upregulated and 214 downregulated genes (false discovery rate < 0.05, absolute fold change >2-fold) for cows pregnant at day 30 versus those that were not pregnant. Functional terms overrepresented in the downregulated genes included those related to immune and inflammatory responses. Machine learning for fertility biomarkers with the R package BORUTA resulted in identification of 57 biomarkers that predicted pregnancy outcome at day 30 with an average accuracy of 77%. Thus, machine learning can identify predictive biomarkers of pregnancy in endometrium with high accuracy. Moreover, sampling of endometrial epithelium using the cytobrush can help understand functional characteristics of the endometrium at artificial insemination without compromising cow fertility. Functional characteristics of the genes comprising the set of biomarkers is indicative that a major determinant of cow fertility, at least for first insemination after calving, is immune status of the uterus, which, in turn, is likely to reflect the previous history of uterine disease.

ID DESIGN
AB In the absence of a high-fidelity physics-based prognostics model, data-driven prognostics methods are widely adopted. In practice, however, data-driven approaches often suffer from insufficient training data, which causes large training uncertainty that hinders the Digital twin (DT)-based decision-making. In such a case, the integration of low-fidelity physics with a data-driven method is highly demanded. This paper introduces physics-informed neural network (PINN)-based prognostics that can utilize low-fidelity physics information, such as monotonicity or the sign of curvature. Low-fidelity physics information is included as a constraint during the optimization process to reduce the training uncertainty in the neural network model by preventing unrealistic predictions. The proposed method is applied to two case studies to demonstrate the effect of reducing the prediction uncertainty and the robustness to the variability in test data. The two case studies show that PINN-based prognostics can successfully reduce the prediction uncertainty and yield more robust prognostics performance than the ordinary neural network.

AB Drug resistance poses a crucial challenge in healthcare, with response rates to chemotherapy and targeted therapy remaining low. Individual patient's resistance is exacerbated by the intricate heterogeneity of tumor cells, presenting significant obstacles to effective treatment. To address this challenge, DrugFormer, a novel graph-augmented large language model designed to predict drug resistance at single-cell level is proposed. DrugFormer integrates both serialized gene tokens and gene-based knowledge graphs for the accurate predictions of drug response. After training on comprehensive single-cell data with drug response information, DrugFormer model presents outperformance, with higher F1, precision, and recall in predicting drug response. Based on the scRNA-seq data from refractory multiple myeloma (MM) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, DrugFormer demonstrates high efficacy in identifying resistant cells and uncovering underlying molecular mechanisms. Through pseudotime trajectory analysisunique drug-resistant cellular states associated with poor patient outcomes are revealed. Furthermore, DrugFormer identifies potential therapeutic targets, such as COX8A, for overcoming drug resistance across different cancer types. In conclusion, DrugFormer represents a significant advancement in the field of drug resistance prediction, offering a powerful tool for unraveling the heterogeneity of cellular response to drugs and guiding personalized treatment strategies.
   DrugFormer, a novel graph-augmented language model, addresses the critical challenge of drug resistance in cancer treatment. By integrating serialized gene tokens and a gene-based knowledge graph, it provides accurate drug response predictions at the single-cell level. DrugFormer demonstrates superior performance and identifies resistant cells with potential therapeutic targets, offering a promising solution for personalized cancer therapy. image

AB Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures are increasingly collected as a means of measuring healthcare quality and value. The capability to predict such measures enables patient-provider shared decision-making and the delivery of patient-centered care. However, PRO measures often suffer from high missing rates, and the missingness may depend on many patient factors. Under such a complex missing mechanism, developing a predictive model for PRO measures with valid inference procedures is challenging, especially when flexible imputation models such as machine learning or nonparametric methods are used. Specifically, the slow convergence rate of the flexible imputation model may lead to non-negligible bias, and the traditional missing propensity, capable of removing such a bias, is hard to estimate due to the complex missing mechanism. To efficiently infer the parameters of interest, we propose to use an informative surrogate that enables a flexible imputation model lying in a low-dimensional subspace. To remove the bias due to the flexible imputation model, we identify a class of weighting functions as alternatives to the traditional propensity score and estimate the low-dimensional one within the identified function class. Based on the estimated low-dimensional weighting function, we construct a onestep debiased estimator without using any information on the true missing propensity. We establish the asymptotic normality of the one-step debiased estimator. Simulation and an application to real-world data demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.

   DEFINITION; SYSTOLIC DYSFUNCTION
AB Myocardial dysfunction is common in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Septic disease frequently results in cardiac dysfunction, and sepsis represents the most common cause of admission and death in the ICU. The association between left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction and mortality is not clear for critically ill patients. Conversely, LV diastolic dysfunction (DD) seems increasingly recognized as a factor associated with poor outcomes, not only in sepsis but also more generally in critically ill patients. Despite recent attempts to simplify the diagnosis and grading of DD, this remains relatively complex, with the need to use several echocardiographic parameters. Furthermore, the current guidelines have several intrinsic limitations when applied to the ICU setting. In this manuscript, we discuss the challenges in DD classification when applied to critically ill patients, the importance of left atrial pressure estimates for the management of patients in ICU, and whether the study of cardiac dysfunction spectrum during critical illness may benefit from the integration of left ventricular and left atrial strain data to improve diagnostic accuracy and implications for the treatment and prognosis.
   LV diastolic dysfunction is common in critically ill patients and is associated with poor outcomes. Echocardiography is used to assess LV diastolic function and estimate LV filling pressures. Recent American Society of Echocardiography/European Association of Cardiovascular Imaging guidelines do not account for the specificities of the critically ill patient and are not validated in this population. LV and left atrial speckle tracking indices and artificial intelligence may provide better insight into the classification of DD in the critically ill.---- image

AB Traditional spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes used to derive galaxy physical properties are often uncertain at the factor of a few level owing to uncertainties in galaxy star formation histories and dust attenuation curves. Beyond this, Bayesian fitting (which is typically used in SED fitting software) is an intrinsically compute-intensive task, often requiring access to expensive hardware for long periods of time. To overcome these shortcomings, we have developed mirkwood: a user-friendly tool comprising an ensemble of supervised machine-learning-based models capable of nonlinearly mapping galaxy fluxes to their properties. By stacking multiple models, we marginalize against any individual model's poor performance in a given region of the parameter space. We demonstrate mirkwood's significantly improved performance over traditional techniques by training it on a combined data set of mock photometry of z = 0 galaxies from the Simba, Eagle, and IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations, and comparing the derived results with those obtained from traditional SED fitting techniques. mirkwood is also able to account for uncertainties arising both from intrinsic noise in observations, and from finite training data and incorrect modeling assumptions. To increase the added value to the observational community, we use Shapley value explanations to fairly evaluate the relative importance of different bands to understand why particular predictions were reached. We envisage mirkwood to be an evolving, open-source framework that will provide highly accurate physical properties from observations of galaxies as compared to traditional SED fitting.
